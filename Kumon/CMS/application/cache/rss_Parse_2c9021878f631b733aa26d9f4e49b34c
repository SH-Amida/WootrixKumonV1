<p><a href="http://www.suzlon.com/">Suzlon Group</a> announced a repeat wind order of 50.40 MW from a leading power utility in India. The project consists of 24 units of <a href="http://www.windpowerengineering.com/featured/business-news-projects/suzlon-tests-a-hybrid-lattice-tower-in-india/">S97 120-m hybrid tower</a> with a rated capacity of 2.1 MW. Located in Kutch, Gujarat, the project is schedule for completion inÂ March 2017.</p>
<div>
<p>The S97 series of 2.1-MW WTG feature the time tested Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) technology, which is designed to maximize generation at lower wind sites. It not only delivers higher energy output, but also offers higher return on investment for our customers.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Suzlon will execute the entire project on a turnkey basis and will also provide O&amp;MÂ services for an initial period of 14 years through an integrated service package. The project has the potential to provide power to over 27,000 households and reduce 0.10 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum.</p>

<p><em>Editorâs note: The Jones Act requires, in part, that goods shipped from U.S. port to U.S. port are carried in U.S. flagged vessels. The act was once considered a hurtle to the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry. Although this discussion focuses on oil and gas, the U.S. wind industry could be affected. </em></p>

<p>On January 18, 2017, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)Â <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Jan/Vol_51_No_3_Title.pdf" target="_blank">proposed revising</a>Â almost 30 Jones Act interpretive rulings going back to 1976. CBPâs proposal could have a substantial effect on offshore oil and gas and other operations. Comments are due on February 17, 2017. The proposed effective date for such changes is unclear.</p>
<p>The Jones Act restricts the transportation of âmerchandiseâ between two âpointsâ in the United States to qualified U.S.-flag vessels. When applied outside the territory of the United States (including outside U.S. territorial waters), the Jones Act applies by virtue of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) as amended. OCSLA generally extends U.S. federal jurisdiction beyond state waters to devices, structures, etc. permanently or temporarily affixed to the seabed on the U.S. outer continental shelf when placed there in connection with defined purposes.</p>
<p>Because the application of the Jones Act to offshore operations can be unclear and complicated, as are other customs laws and requirements, CBP maintains a process whereby affected persons can seek an interpretive ruling in advance of engaging in certain activity to ensure that such activity is in accord with CBPâs interpretation of the law. Such rulings once issued are available on CBPâs website in its CROSS system.</p>
<p>One exception to the Jones Act is for the carriage between two U.S. points of âvessel equipment,â which has not been considered âmerchandiseâ as defined in the Jones Act. CBP has relied on a 1939 definition of âvessel equipmentâ which provides that the term âincludes articles necessary and appropriate for the navigation, operation or maintenance of a vesselâ¦.â Over time, CBP has issued numerous rulings interpreting this definition including determining that âvessel equipmentâ included items âessential to the mission of the vessel.â</p>
<p>This became controversial culminating in a ruling in 2009 which determined, consistent with prior rulings, that a sub-sea assembly (sometimes referred to as a âChristmas Treeâ) was vessel equipment when transported by a construction vessel which had as its purpose the installation of such equipment. Certain industry participants argued that CBP had adopted an overly broad interpretation of âvessel equipment.â</p>
<p>Apparently, as a result of those arguments, the sub-sea assembly ruling was first issued and then withdrawn following a CBP public proposal to revoke or revise a number of vessel equipment related rulings. In that instance, the docket filled with strongly held views from both sides and CBP appeared to abandon the effort. The January 18, 2017, notice resumes that effort.</p>
<p>Specifically, CBP is proposing to modify significantly a 1976 ruling relating to an offshore construction vesselâs operations which in turn will affect a number of rulings which relied on the 1976 decision. CBP is also proposing revising its views of what constitutes âvessel equipmentâ that would affect another ten rulings and would appear to pare back significantly the âvessel equipmentâ exception to the Jones Act. As almost 30 long-standing interpretations may change, this could have a substantial effect on offshore vessel operations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moventas is expanding its wind gearbox assembly and testing capacity at its manufacturing locations in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland. The investment includes expansion of component manufacturing, serial production facilities and new 6-MW testing facilities. The investment expands existing gear manufacturing capacity to over 5 GW, with the ability to expand further as volumes grow. The expansion related construction works will be finalized by the end of 2017 and the additional capacity will be operational by Q1/2018. The overall investment is â¬17 million and will be done in co-operation with municipally owned real estate company, Jykes KiinteistÃ¶t Oy.</p>
<div id="attachment_31254" style="width: 591px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.windpowerengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Moventas-factory-expansion-in-Finland.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-31254" src="http://www.windpowerengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Moventas-factory-expansion-in-Finland.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="423" srcset="http://3ohkdk3zdzcq1dul50oqjvvf.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Moventas-factory-expansion-in-Finland.jpg 937w, http://3ohkdk3zdzcq1dul50oqjvvf.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Moventas-factory-expansion-in-Finland-300x218.jpg 300w, http://3ohkdk3zdzcq1dul50oqjvvf.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Moventas-factory-expansion-in-Finland-164x119.jpg 164w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moventas designed Exceed with 20% more torque density, 10% less size and with 100% proven Moventas technology in response to the market challenge to lower the life cycle cost of wind power.</p></div>
<p>The investment will enable Moventas to meet the growing demand for its Exceed series gearbox. Moventas designed Exceed with 20% more torque density, 10% less size and with 100% proven Moventas technology in response to the market challenge to lower the life cycle cost of wind power. The best-in-class performance from Exceed has been proven in the field with over 1 GW of Exceed gearboxes delivered to three customers in five continents over the past year.</p>
<p>Moventas CEO Arto Lahtela comments, âWe designed Exceed to fulfill the market need for bigger gearboxes that could improve the life cycle cost of wind power. This significant new investment in capacity will enable us to meet the growing demand from our customers for Exceed gears. By investing further in Finland alongside our other manufacturing facilities, we can shorten our production lead-times, improve our efficiency and ensure continued high quality standardsâ.</p>
<p>This investment in overall capacity on assembly and testing will also serve Moventasâ multi-brand service business which sees growing demand for service and repair from bigger gears as Europeâs fleet of wind turbines matures. Moventas has a global network of high quality wind gearbox service centers but the gearbox manufacturing expertise is centralized in Finland. With the investment Moventas enforces its commitment to the region, its local workforce and the efficient international supplier network that has been built around the facility in the past years.</p>
