            <title>12 Reasons Why Bearings Fail</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/16/1af2b07d-a80d-4b68-8508-c87809f31bb4_steel-bearings.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 323px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Things break. No matter what you do, there is always a chance that products will fail. The same holds true for bearings, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you can&amp;rsquo;t prevent many of the issues that result in costly downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article is a guide to the major factors that can lead to bearing failure as well as how you can prevent the issues from happening. By learning more about these potential problems and knowing how to stop them, you can get the most life out of your bearings and make your application much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Lubrication Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to a recent study, up to 80 percent of bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication. This includes insufficient lubrication, use of improper lubricants or excessive temperatures that degrade the lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Look for discolored rolling elements (such as blue or brown) and rolling-element tracks as well as overheating or excessive wear in the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Use the appropriate type and correct amount of lubricant, avoid grease loss, and follow appropriate relubrication intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Contamination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contamination is caused by foreign substances getting into bearing lubricants or cleaning solutions. These include dirt, abrasive grit, dust, steel chips from contaminated work areas and dirty hands or tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Watch for denting of rolling elements and raceways that cause vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Filter the lubricant and clean work areas, tools, fixtures and hands to reduce the risk of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Improper Mounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most instances, bearings should be mounted with a press fit on the rotating ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A number of conditions can cause denting, wear, cracked rings, high operating temperatures, early fatigue and premature failure of bearings. These include mounting bearings on shafts by applying pressure or blows to the outer race, mounting bearings into a housing by pressing on the inner ring, loose shaft fits, loose housing fits, excessively tight fits, out-of-round housings and a poor finish on the bearing seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow proper mounting instructions and provide training to ensure all employees understand the difference between a properly and improperly installed mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Misalignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bent shafts, out-of-square shaft shoulders, out-of-square spacers, out-of-square clamping nuts and improper installation due to loose fits can cause misalignment, which may result in overheating and separator failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A wear path that is not parallel to the raceway edges of the non-rotating ring should be noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Prevent it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspect shafts and housings for runout of shoulders and bearing seats, and use precision-grade locknuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. False Brinelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rapid movement of the balls in a raceway while equipment is idle wears away at the lubrication. In addition, a lack of rotation in the bearing does not allow fresh lubricant to return to the spot. Both of these conditions result in false brinelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may see linear wear marks in the axial direction at the rolling-element pitch or no raised edges as opposed to marks due to incorrect mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eliminate or absorb external vibration that could cause the balls to move. Also, be sure to use lubricants containing anti-wear additives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Corrosion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moisture, acid, low-quality or broken-down grease, poor wrappings and condensation from excessive temperature reversals can cause corrosion that is abrasive to the finely finished surfaces of ball and roller bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Look for red and brown stains or deposits on rolling elements, raceways or cages, as well as increased vibration followed by wear, an increase in radial clearance or loss of the preload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Divert corrosive fluids away from bearing areas. Select integrally sealed bearings and consider external seals for particularly hostile environments. Using the proper bearing material, such as stainless steel, can help if you cannot avoid a corrosive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. Electrical Damage (Fluting)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Constant passage of alternating or direct current, even with low currents, can lead to electrical damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brownish marks may be observed parallel to the axis on a large part of the raceway or covering the entire raceway circumference. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prevent electrical currents from flowing through the bearing by grounding or using insulated bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	8. Fatigue (Spalling)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spalling is often the result of overloading, an excessive preload, tight inner-ring fits and using the bearing beyond its calculated fatigue life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fatigue can be indicated by the fracture of running surfaces and subsequent removal of small, discrete particles of material from the inner ring, outer ring or rolling elements. Spalling is progressive and will spread with continued operation. It is always accompanied by a noticeable increase in vibration and noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Replace the bearing and/or consider a redesign that uses a bearing with greater calculated fatigue life, internal clearances, and proper shaft and housing recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	9. Overheating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overheating is generally the result of excessive operating temperatures and improper lubrication. High temperatures can cause grease to bleed (purge the oil), which reduces the lubricant&amp;rsquo;s efficiency. In elevated temperature conditions, oxidation can lead to the loss of lubricating oils from the grease, leaving a dry, crusty soap that can seize the bearing. Higher temperatures also reduce the hardness of the metal, causing early failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note any discoloration of the rings, rolling elements and cages. In extreme cases, the bearing components will deform. Higher temperatures can also degrade or destroy the lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thermal or overload controls, adequate heat paths and supplemental cooling are among the best options to mitigate overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	10. Excessive Loads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Putting too much load on a bearing is another common cause of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may see heaving rolling-element wear paths, evidence of overheating and widespread fatigue areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reduce the load or consider a redesign using a bearing with greater capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	11. Improper Storage and Handling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improper storage exposes bearings to dampness and dust. Storing bearings in excessively high temperatures can also degrade a grease&amp;rsquo;s shelf life, so always check with the grease manufacturer for storage specifications. Handling bearings by opening boxes and tearing wrappings prematurely can let in dirt and expose bearings to corrosive elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Watch for dampness and temperatures that can cause rust and/or uncovered bearings in a storage area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Store bearings in a dry area at room temperature. Always cover bearings to keep them clean while in storage and take them to the installation site before unwrapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	12. Fit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A tight fit can be caused by excessive loading of the rolling element when interference fits exceed the radial clearance at operating temperatures. Micro-motion between fitted parts where the fits are too loose in relation to the acting forces may result in a loose fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a tight fit, look for a heavy rolling-element wear path in the bottom of the raceway, overheating or an inner-ring axial crack. For a loose fit, note any fretting (generation of fine metal particles), which leaves a distinctive brown color. Wear at the fitting surfaces can cause noise and runout problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to Fix it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure a proper clearance is selected to avoid fit issues. Refer to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s installation guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Preventing Failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By becoming aware of the different problems that can cause a bearing failure and the signs to look for, you have already taken a big step toward limiting machine failures. Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for the symptoms of a bearing failure to take action. Regular preventive measures can keep your bearings at peak performance for as long as possible, saving your business time and money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Measure and Set the Clearance of a Spherical Bearing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing how to measure and set the clearance on a spherical bearing can help lower the risk of the bearing failing prematurely. This 6-minute, 13-second video demonstrates how to measure the radial internal clearance on spherical roller bearings prior to mounting, as well as how to set the radial internal clearance when mounting tapered-bore spherical bearings on a tapered adapter sleeve or shaft.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How the Right Bearings Can Improve Your Manufacturing Process</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/13/b9466af3-8a1d-4b7a-834b-bac9501b94b4_bearings.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 241px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A good production process is a smooth production process. A smooth production process is a more profitable one. While it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to avoid every production problem before it happens, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk. One of the most overlooked areas of opportunity in this regard is bearing selection. This article will focus on low-friction bearings and how they can help you cut production costs, improve productivity and help your manufacturing process become more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Prevent Machine Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In its simplest terms, machine failure means a machine (or component) has stopped functioning the way it was originally intended. This could be a catastrophic failure or a loss of effectiveness from a still-working machine. For example, a pump that was designed to move 100 gallons of water per minute that can now only move 50 gallons per minute would be classified as a machine failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is estimated that 70 percent of machine failures result from surface degradation, and that the majority of surface degradation issues result from mechanical wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although any bearing inherently reduces friction, a microscopic view of a bearing&amp;rsquo;s surface will reveal rough imperfections that actually create friction. Compared to standard bearings, low-friction bearings reduce frictional movement by 30 percent or more. This reduces surface degradation, which reduces the risk of machine failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most obvious benefit of using low-friction bearings is cost. Because you spend less on replacement parts and because employees don&amp;rsquo;t lose productivity during downtime periods, you&amp;rsquo;re able to decrease your total cost of ownership of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is also less opportunity cost. If a machine is operating at 50 percent efficiency, you simply can&amp;rsquo;t produce as many widgets as possible in a given period. This not only creates a hidden bottleneck that makes meeting production demands more difficult, it also means widgets that could be made are not. In other words, you have less product to sell and less revenue to show for your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Energy Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the price of meeting the world&amp;rsquo;s energy demands through 2030 will be $26.3 trillion. In order to pay for this increased demand, energy costs are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the machines you use in the production process account for a significant portion of your company&amp;rsquo;s energy consumption. This is exactly where energy demand impacts your production process. In essence, it costs more to create the same product, which leaves you with a couple of options: raise prices on the end product and/or find ways to cut production costs. Fortunately, low-friction bearings can help you meet this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Machines that use low-friction bearings require less energy and therefore less money. This improves your company&amp;rsquo;s cash flow, which means you can invest in new or upgraded machines, new employees, or some other critical business area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an added bonus, because greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated with energy consumption, low-friction bearings are better for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Employee Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All operating machines create waste heat. This increases air temperature that, if left unchecked, can negatively impact employee productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the optimal working temperature is between 68 and 76 degrees F. Working environments above this temperature range make it more difficult for workers to concentrate and lead to them feeling fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because low-friction bearings reduce abrasion, your factory&amp;rsquo;s machines produce less heat. This makes it easier and less costly to keep the working conditions at comfortable, more productive temperatures. In other words, comfortable employees are happy employees. Happy employees are more productive employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Choosing the right bearing for your application is very important. When it comes to your plant&amp;rsquo;s production process, low-friction bearings provide a way to keep costs down long after the initial order is made because they limit machine failure, are more energy efficient and keep employees comfortable and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Best Practices for Bearing Protection</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Until all motors are designed with built-in bearing protection, plant maintenance personnel and motor repair shops will continue to replace damaged bearings. But if a motor&amp;#39;s bearing problem is fixed correctly and proper mitigation installed, it only has to be done once. Better yet, informed technicians can make use of the latest diagnostic techniques (vibration analysis, thermography, shaft-voltage testing, etc.) to ward off electrical bearing damage from the beginning. For a new motor or one already in service, this is what is meant by &amp;quot;best practices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Problem: Electrical Bearing Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Variable frequency drives (VFDs) or inverters can save 30 percent or more in energy costs. Because of this, they have been cited as a key technology for those wishing to make their processing plants, automated assembly lines, HVAC systems and other equipment more energy-efficient (&amp;quot;green&amp;quot;).Unfortunately, whether used to control a motor&amp;#39;s speed or torque, VFDs often induce voltages and currents that can damage bearings. In fact, the costly repair or replacement of failed motor bearings can wipe out any savings a VFD yields and severely diminish the reliability of an entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bearing failure rates vary widely, but evidence suggests that a significant portion of these failures occur only three to 12 months after system startup. Because many of today&amp;#39;s motors have sealed bearings to keep out dirt and other contaminants, electrical damage has become the most common cause of bearing failure in AC motors with VFDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The high switching frequencies of today&amp;#39;s VFDs produce parasitic capacitance between a motor&amp;#39;s stator and rotor. By now it is widely understood that once the resulting shaft voltages overcome the dielectric properties of bearing grease, they discharge along the path of least resistance &amp;mdash; typically through the bearings (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/9/43ea7dec-245c-4a42-9777-2e4deac767a4_figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 535px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voltages arcing through the bearings of VFD-driven motors create thousands of pits, which cause increased friction and noise and the potential for costly unplanned downtime as bearing grease deteriorates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These discharges are so frequent that they create millions of tiny fusion craters. Before long, the entire bearing race wall can become marked with countless pits known as frosting. A phenomenon known as fluting may occur as well, shaping the frosting into washboard-like ridges across the bearing race (Figure 2).This causes noise, vibration, increased friction and catastrophic bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-right: 20px; float: left;"&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/9/44758f4a-5ee6-4af1-ba13-03202d23c7fb_figure 2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a process called fluting, pits form &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;washboard-like ridges on a bearing race &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;wall &amp;mdash; ridges that cause still more noise &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;and vibration and accelerate bearing failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Types of Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the bearings degrade, the tiny metal particles blasted from the fusion craters intensify friction and abrasion, heat up the bearings, and burn the contaminated grease. Too often, the end result is bearing failure and costly unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Understanding the Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cutting and carefully inspecting the bearings of motors needing repair will often provide information that can be used to prevent a recurrence of the problem. Following established safety precautions, technicians should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspect the bearing cavity, retaining a sample of the grease in case further analysis is warranted to detect contaminants, signs of excessive heat, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cut the outer race in half.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clean the bearing&amp;#39;s components with a solvent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		With a microscope, inspect the race walls for electrical pitting/frosting/fluting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Protecting Motors for the Long Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If inspection of the old bearing indicates electrical damage, the most reliable and cost-effective way to protect replacement bearings is to install a modern shaft grounding ring. Unlike older single-point contact brushes, these rings completely surround a motor&amp;#39;s shaft with contact points. Conductive microfibers should line the ring&amp;#39;s entire inner circumference, boosting the electron transfer rate (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-right: 20px; float: left;"&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/9/330e3105-6aee-4414-8b2f-6da16446a7e1_figure 3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Figure 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best grounding rings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;are lined with flexible, conductive &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;microfibers that completely surround &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;the motor shaft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A properly installed ring provides a very low impedance path from shaft to frame, safely bleeding off damaging voltages to ground and bypassing the motor&amp;#39;s bearings entirely. Because the microfibers work with little or no contact, they do not clog up and wear out like conventional grounding brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A growing number of forward-looking motor manufacturers have recently added a factory-installed shaft grounding ring as a standard or optional feature on certain models, but they are still exceptions to the rule. Many industrial supply houses and distributors of motors and bearings sell grounding rings that can be installed on new, refurbished or in-service motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tips and&amp;nbsp;Tricks for Ring Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To maximize a grounding ring&amp;#39;s effectiveness, all electrical paths must be conductive. Paint on the motor&amp;#39;s faceplate must be removed. Likewise, the motor&amp;#39;s shaft must be cleaned down to bare metal. Even after scrubbing with an emery cloth, wiping the shaft with a non-petroleum-based solvent will remove unseen residues. After cleaning, the conductivity of the shaft should be checked with an ohm meter. If the reading at the section that will contact the ring&amp;#39;s microfibers is higher than 2ohms, the shaft should be cleaned again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A grounding ring should never operate over a shaft keyway, which has sharp edges and could reduce conductivity. On some motors, the dimensions of the spacer and mounting screws can sometimes be adjusted/changed to avoid a keyway. If this is not feasible, the portion of the keyway that will contact the ring&amp;#39;s microfibers should be filled with epoxy putty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conductivity should be further enhanced by lightly, but evenly coating with colloidal silver any portion of the shaft that will contact the ring&amp;#39;s microfibers. This will also help retard corrosion (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-right: 20px; float: left;"&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/9/61778e8e-7655-4c68-b52f-bc691775f110_figure 4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Figure 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prior to installation of a grounding ring, the motor &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;shaft must be cleaned down to bare metal, free of any &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;nonconductive material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conductivity can be further &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;enhanced by coating the part of the shaft that will contact &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;the ring with colloidal silver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thread-locking gels and liquids other than conductive epoxy are not recommended for the screws that mount the ring to the motor, as they might compromise the conductive path to ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ring should be centered on the motor shaft so that its microfibers contact the shaft evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When mounting the ring externally to an end bracket, split rings designed to slip around an in-service motor&amp;#39;s shaft instead of over its end simplify installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After installation, testing with an ohm meter is again recommended. The best method is to place one probe on the ring and one on the motor frame. (The motor and drive must be grounded to common-earth ground in accordance with applicable standards.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Variations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For environments where the motor will be exposed to excessive amounts of dirt, dust or other debris, it may be necessary to protect the ring&amp;#39;s fibers with an O-ring or V-slinger. Bearing isolators with built-in circumferential grounding rings are also available. For severe-duty environments such as many mining applications, however, mounting the shaft grounding ring inside the motor provides the best protection from contamination (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/9/fc946072-4607-4ef2-9ef9-8de1fb4f57d6_figure 5.jpeg" style="width: 480px; height: 384px; margin: 9px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-right: 20px; float: left;"&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal installation of the grounding ring provides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;extra protection from dust, dirt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and other contaminants in severe-duty &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using conductive epoxy or screws, the ring can be mounted directly to a bearing retainer. An additional machined spacer will keep the ring away from the bearing grease cavity. Metal-to-metal contact is still essential, so the bearing retainer must be free of any coatings or other nonconductive material where it will touch the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For horizontally or vertically mounted motors with horsepower of 100 or less and single-row radial ball bearings on both ends, a shaft grounding ring can be installed on either end. For horizontally mounted motors with horsepower greater than 100 and single-row radial ball bearings on both ends, the bearing housing at the nondrive end must be electrically isolated to disrupt circulating currents. Options for achieving such isolation include insulated sleeves, nonconductive coatings, ceramic bearings or hybrid bearings. The grounding ring should be installed at the drive end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For any motor in which the bearings at both ends are already insulated, the drive end is preferred for installation of a grounding ring to protect bearings in attached equipment such as a gearbox, pump, fan or encoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For any motor with cylindrical roller, Babbitt or sleeve bearings, the end with such bearings should be electrically isolated, and the grounding ring should be installed at the opposite end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Protection Starts at Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring shaft voltage on a VFD-driven motor provides valuable information for determining whether there is a risk of electrical bearing damage. The best time to take such measurements is during the startup of a new or recently repaired motor. Every motor has its own unique parameters. Combined with vibration analysis, thermography or other diagnostic services, results (including saved oscilloscope-screen images) can be presented in a report to the supervisor/customer. Results should then be used in developing preventive and predictive maintenance programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shaft voltages are easily measured (using appropriate safety procedures) by touching an oscilloscope probe to the shaft while the motor is running. The best probe will have a tip of high-density conductive microfibers to ensure continuous contact with the rotating shaft. A portable oscilloscope with a bandwidth of at least 100 megahertz should deliver accurate waveform measurements. Probe/oscilloscope kits are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Confirming Motors are Protected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as shaft voltage measurements can show that a motor&amp;#39;s bearings are in danger of electrical damage, they can also confirm that a shaft grounding ring is working. If a proven ring has been properly installed, typical discharge voltage peaks should be less than 10 volts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Getting the Most from Your Motors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, end users of VFD-driven motors have every right to expect uptime and reliability. After all, VFD-induced electrical bearing damage can now be prevented, not just repaired. Routine inspection, testing and analysis can provide advance warning and insight into the problem, and when bearings fail, proper repair practices can fix the problem for good. Motor shaft grounding rings can be installed during motor repairs or on new motors before they are put into service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/lAdn0Ppw56A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Saving Time and Money with Condition Monitoring </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent acoustic emission (AE) study identified a potential critical bearing failure that became a planned preventive action for a leading food manufacturer. This also avoided considerable cost and unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic emission equipment and the main tool used during the planned inspection routes were manufactured by Holroyd Instruments. This example will show the value of this type of equipment in avoiding a major unplanned event that could have had massive cost consequences for the business. Collateral damage to the associated equipment would have proved very costly, and the lead time to rebuild could have caused extensive downtime that would have meant disgruntled customers not being able to rely on stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story began in April 2010 when some initial elevated readings were noted at two node points on a large step-down transfer gearbox that were sampled on a seven-day routine. The distress readings were elevated and triggered the alarm level. They were of concern and evident on subsequent inspections. The third elevated reading that was part of an upward trend instigated a planned work order in the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) to investigate and take further action. This equipment could not be taken out of service lightly, as it was at the time constrained by high production demands. Experience with a sister line&amp;rsquo;s previous planned bearing change also played an important part in the escalation of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/9947803a-3bb4-493b-9873-9b1e92eff658_gearbox.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 558px; height: 352px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The input side of a transfer gearbox is shown with the output bearing node point on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On more detailed inspections, it was determined that the bearing with the highest distress was indeed the suspected output bearing. Audible clicks were loud and clear at the output end bearing. The two bearings at the node locations were on the drive line of the motor at the input and output ends of the transfer gearbox. The adjacent bearings on the large, helical step-down gear were still reading low and had no audible clicks. The engineering manager was advised that there was an anomaly on one of the input bearings, that the others were in good condition and that production could continue with targeted condition monitoring. The routine oil sampling was increased from monthly to every two weeks. AE inspections were increased, with spectrum readings now on a four-day cycle. This would give some comparative evidence when the new bearings were eventually fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned change of the bearing set was arranged with the production planner, maintenance manager and product specialist. It became clear that the equipment would have to operate for at least another six months until it became available. Contingency plans were formulated for an emergency change if any of the AE readings or oil samples showed advances toward failure. Warnings were issued that this could occur rapidly if the bearing failed. A new bearing set was purchased, and a meeting was scheduled with the bearing manufacturer to examine the used bearings when they were eventually changed in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AE readings stayed at an elevated level during this long waiting phase, and oil sample results showed no elevated readings in the key elements associated with roller bearing failures. During the weeks before renewal, many spectra were taken from all points of the gearbox for future evaluation. This would rule out frequencies from the oil pump and other components around the assembly. An AE envelope spectrum graph before the bearing change is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/254014f7-f16e-44dd-96f8-d80ead41bf1d_spectra 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 630px; height: 209px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As can be seen, there was something creating a spike at 73Hz, which happened to match the frequency of the bearing race. This provided a clue that there was a race surface defect of some kind and not an element breaking down or the cage disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing change finally took place, and the production plant was turned around within 12 hours so that the equipment did not incur any unplanned downtime. The used bearing set was returned with the transfer gearbox, and the two units were degreased. On first inspection, they both looked similar and in good order. The elements and cages were then dismantled from the outer and inner races, with care taken to keep them in order and in the correct aspect for reassembly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It became clear that on the suspect output bearing, a major spall on the inner race had developed, and every element was pitted with the debris that had emitted. At this point, a representative from the bearing manufacturer was invited to visit and examine the bearings. He concurred that the bearings had lasted very well considering the atmosphere and heat in which they had operated for almost 10 years. This would be considered an end-of-lifetime mode of failure. It may have lasted many more months or could have accelerated to failure within days or weeks. The photograph below is of the spall that measured approximately 10 mm in length and 2.5 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/3a11d97c-28b7-4388-aa85-57dc40e9a028_spall damage.jpeg" style="width: 630px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Spall damage to the race is shown above with feathered edges and surface pitting in the loaded area of the spalling. Note the next layer of material on the right-hand side that would have given way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the remedial work had been completed, additional spectrum samples were recorded and monitored to learn more. Carpet noise levels were lower, and the decibel scale was a third of the previous graph example. The maximum peak was now less than 0.4 decibels, while the carpet level was less than 0.2 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the systems and tools relied on every day proved effective in capturing this anomaly before it turned into a major event. The key to this was the full involvement of engineering with operations to plan in the remedial work with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the lessons learned were that the inspection frequencies at seven-day intervals were correct for this critical plant, the preventive action was started at the earliest opportunity, the equipment enabled the pinpointing of the bearing fault, the audio facility allowed a second reference that linked rpm with the audible clicks and that this all gave sufficient evidence for the planned work to commence at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root-cause analysis was carried out directly after the bearing change was completed to investigate any future recommendations for servicing this equipment. It was decided that as the bearings had reached their end-of-life cycle, there was no need to alter any future planned maintenance. Condition monitoring with AE had provided the confidence to pick up any anomalies at a very early stage in the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kittiwake Launches MHC Bearing Checker</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kittiwake recently announced the launch of its MHC Bearing Checker, a small handheld device that can provide instant indication of machinery condition. The acoustic emission-based instrument is designed as a cost-effective solution to monitoring an unlimited number of machines on a periodic basis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on the detection of high-frequency activity that is naturally generated by deterioration in rotating machinery, the MHC Bearing Checker&amp;rsquo;s Distress parameter removes the need for machine-specific interpretations. If the Distress parameter is greater than 10, the user knows there is a problem and can instigate further checks. A decibel level is also provided, giving an indication of the overall noise of the bearing, which increases with the rotation speed as well as with degradation of the bearing or inadequate lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Each measurement takes approximately 10 seconds and requires no setup, previous history or knowledge of machine design details such as bearing type, number of balls or race diameters. The same Distress interpretation is applied across all machine types, effectively &amp;ldquo;deskilling&amp;rdquo; the technology so maintenance professionals can take a proactive approach to predictive maintenance and make informed decisions quickly and with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides entry-level condition monitoring at a price that makes it a feasible addition to every engineer&amp;rsquo;s back pocket,&amp;rdquo; says Martin Lucas, Kittiwake Group&amp;rsquo;s managing director. &amp;ldquo;This is a simple, cost-effective means of spotting problems in bearings, gearboxes, motors and pumps at an early stage, ultimately saving the company money by avoiding downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The unit is powered by an internal rechargeable battery, offering up to 1,000 measurements between charges. Recharging is accomplished through a micro USB port. The device can be connected to any standard PC USB port for ease of recharging.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides an instant indication of machinery health, but the real value stems from collating historical data and trending,&amp;rdquo; Lucas adds. &amp;ldquo;Devising routes and analyzing results over time enables a better understanding of machinery and creates real intelligence on how the bearings react to changes in operation, how issues develop and how long it will last until complete failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken to Invest $225 Million at Ohio Steel Plant </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After securing a new five-year labor agreement, officials at the Timken Company recently announced they will move forward with a $225-million investment at the Faircrest Steel Plant in Stark County, Ohio. With this investment, the specialty alloy steel manufacturer will improve productivity, expand its product range and increase capacity to serve growing demand for alloy steel bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are seeing growing demand for Timken specialty steel to support the most demanding energy and industrial applications,&amp;quot; said Salvatore J. Miraglia Jr., Timken&amp;rsquo;s president. &amp;quot;This is the right time to make the kind of investment that will improve our operating performance while also expanding our capacity and size range for these products. Combined, that will strengthen our ability to serve these important industries and position the business for continued profitable growth and greater shareholder value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ratification of a new extended labor agreement between Timken and members of United Steelworkers (USW) Local&amp;shy;&amp;shy; 1123 established workforce stability through project construction and startup in 2014. The labor agreement covers four facilities in Stark County through September 2017 and replaces an agreement that would have expired in the midst of the project&amp;#39;s startup in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ladle refiner and large-bloom continuous caster are central to the productivity gains from the investment. The new equipment also is expected to increase the Faircrest operation&amp;#39;s shippable capacity by 25 percent and enable the production of a broader range of large-diameter bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have a highly skilled, capable workforce committed to continuous improvement,&amp;quot; said Thomas D. Moline, vice president of steel manufacturing. &amp;quot;Our team understands what it takes to make custom-melted, high-quality alloy bars and tubes that meet our customers&amp;#39; exacting metallurgical requirements. This investment, which is the largest since opening the plant in 1985, builds on those skills to improve our productivity while giving us the ability to offer even more to the customers who rely on us for their own success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Known for its power-transmission products that include bearings, gears and related components, Timken reported sales of $5.2 billion in 2011 with 21,000 people operating from locations in 30 countries.

            <title>Condition Monitoring on Drilling Platforms: A Case Study </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There are many types of drilling platforms used across the world. Figure 1 is an example of the different types of platforms that are used for oil or gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/8b9abf9d-7579-4bcf-b868-0661d4ab130d_Ludeca_fig 1.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 448px; height: 294px;" /&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/c2076ff4-d7ed-48d5-97d2-0103281ab63b_Ludeca_fig1a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 161px; height: 207px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 &amp;ndash; Types of Drilling Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in its energy and water needs, housing electrical generation, water declinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating storage unit and/or tanker loading facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extraction of volatile substances under extreme pressure in a hostile environment means risk. Thus, accidents and tragedies occasionally occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring can detect machine failures ahead of time and thereby prevent machine failures that could result in extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/2722ea12-2db7-4566-9d02-fa632a2b87f5_Ludeca_fig2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 331px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most important machines to be monitored on drilling platforms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Drilling machines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Draw works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mud pumps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sheaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thrusters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the drilling machine becomes inoperable, the platform can no longer complete its essential task of drilling. The drilling machines can be difficult to monitor for vibration, as the machine is variable speed, low rpm and variable loaded. When analyzing data on a drilling machine, many transient events occur during its operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/fa12bdfa-a158-4e76-9094-824e315d0c35_Ludeca_fig2a.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 333px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/1ed0d330-78c4-4f26-8944-ed1f8f28e0dc_Ludeca_fig 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 94px; height: 328px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Vibxpertvibration data collector by Ludeca was used to collect data on a DDM 750 AC 1M drilling machine at the workshop to check for factory acceptance. The Vibxpert allows for high-resolution time signal and spectrum measurements to be collected. The Vibxpert can collect more than 100,000 lines of resolution, which allows for the Vibxpert to capture any transient events that might occur. The vibration data was collected while there was no load on the machine. The main shaft speed was 216 rpm, and the motor itself was turning 1762 rpm. The red &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;s in Figure 4 indicate where vibration data was collected on the DDM 750 AC 1M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/ff4eb65d-096b-4958-8119-b6efaf651cda_Ludeca_fig 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 407px; height: 462px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: DDM 750 AC 1M Drilling Machine: Vibration Data Collection Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the vibration data was collected, the data was transferred back into the Omnitrendsoftware for analyzing. Vibration analysis on the machine during the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) detected impacts from the cage (train) in the pinion upper bearing. The defect is shown on both the time waveform and the envelope FFT as depicted in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/e813462c-5431-4716-a700-a573164402d0_Ludeca_5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 607px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Omnitrend SW Time Waveform plot and envelope FFT before Corrective Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the vibration defect patterns, the factory decided to replace the bearings before the DDM 750 AC 1M was shipped to the customer. Once the new bearings were installed, additional vibration data was collected. The blue data is the latest vibration data collected. The bearing issue has been corrected by replacing the defective bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/31e5fe9b-4e99-413f-a2b3-2b670db8c135_Ludeca_fig 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 588px; height: 437px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Omnitrend SW Time Waveform plot and envelope FFT after Corrective Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many defects were noted on the bearing once it was removed from the DDM 750 AC 1M. Wear was detected on the cage and pockets, and the inner race showed a grayish wear pattern with indentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conclusion: This is not a bearing you would want in a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/2d31b570-d4b7-4c89-b5bc-1f7d23580334_Ludeca_fig 7.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 650px; height: 362px;" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ceramic bearings designed for the food processing industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings has introduced&amp;nbsp;its new and expanded line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and specialty lubricates specifically designed for the food processing and food packaging industries. Some of the most pressing issues facing the food manufacturing industry today are controlling costs and food safety. Full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings are capable of alleviating some of these concerns. Ceramic balls are far more efficient than steel balls because the rolling surface is more spherically perfect and therefore reduces friction. Companies that converted to ceramic bearings have seen a decrease of energy consumption and were therefore able to cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ceramic in ball form is twice the Rockwell hardness of steel which results in a more durable and longer lasting bearing. Boca Bearings line of full ceramic and ceramic hybrid bearings are appropriate for use in food packaging and food processing due to their ability to work in challenging conditions. Ceramic materials can operate in extreme temperatures, work with heavy loads and will not corrode or rust when exposed to water, alkali or acids, as might be customary during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings also offers a line of traditional lubrication, solid lubrication and dry lubrication that are FDA approved for food manufacturing facilities. For example Boca&amp;rsquo;s exclusive Ultra Dry Lube (UDL) is an extensively modified Lamellar composition that adds less than half a micron to any metal substrate. UDL molecularly bonds to most materials and is inorganic, non-toxic, non-corrosive and resistant to most fuels, solvents and acids present in food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further Boca Bearings offers the Lightning Solid Lube (LSL) line of solid Polyethylene and Graphite lubricants. LSL Poly lube, available in food grade and non food grade, is excellent for continuous operating temperatures up to 93&amp;deg;C (200&amp;deg;F) that can drastically increase bearing life and eliminate dripping oil or grease. LSL Graphite lube can be used in extreme operating temperatures from -157&amp;deg;C (-250 &amp;deg;F) to 349&amp;deg;C (660&amp;deg;F); Graphite Lube is insoluble in most organic solutions and will not wash out in water, steam or chemical wash down procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing protection rings help cement plant boost uptime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seemed as though nothing could stop the squealing. Not that the Monarch Cement Company&amp;rsquo;s huge ball mill wasn&amp;rsquo;t already loud. Powered by a 5,000-horsepower motor, it pulverizes 100 tons of clinker (a burned mixture of limestone and shale) per hour. But the squealing was not what Randy Riebel wanted to hear. As electrical supervisor at Monarch&amp;rsquo;s plant in Humboldt, Kan., he knew the noise meant the motor&amp;rsquo;s bearings were going &amp;ndash; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the sound of chronic bearing damage was all too familiar at the plant, which has the capacity to produce 1.3 million tons of cement a year. Since 2001, when the ball mill was new, its motor bearings had been replaced three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We kept greasing those bearings, but they kept on squealing,&amp;rdquo; Riebel recalls. &amp;ldquo;We knew that if we waited too long, the bearing race walls would become fluted like they had in the past, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to another replacement because of all the expense and downtime. It takes at least 10 days to pull that motor &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a major production. Sometimes we have to hire help, rent a hoist to put it on a truck and take it away to be rebuilt. So this time (summer of 2009), I decided to try something else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo; was the AEGIS iPRO Bearing Protection Ring, manufactured by Maine-based Electro Static Technology (EST). By safely channeling harmful electrical currents away from bearings to ground, the iPRO extends the lives of medium-voltage motors and generators, thus improving the reliability of entire systems in which they are used. It is available in a range of sizes to accommodate generator/motor shafts up to 30 inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance-free, the AEGIS iPRO is ideal for medium-voltage motors that drive pumps, compressors, mixers, shredders, conveyors and other machinery used in mining, food processing, wastewater treatment, petrochemical refining and many other high-current applications. The iPRO also protects the bearings of generators in both utility and on-site power generation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel had been discussing electrical bearing damage with Scott Wilkins, manager of motor shop operations for Independent Electric Machinery Company (IEMCO), a local motor and equipment repair shop. Wilkins recommended the iPRO, and Riebel had IEMCO install two of them on the ball mill motor. While for most large motors EST recommends installing an iPRO in the drive end and insulation on the non-drive end, for some large motors &amp;ndash; especially those that do not have insulation designed into them or where insulation cannot be easily installed &amp;ndash; EST recommends installing iPRO rings at both the drive end and the non-drive end of the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel and Wilkins chose the iPRO split-ring model, which is designed to facilitate field retrofits. The mating halves of each iPRO were installed around the motor shaft without the need to decouple the motor from the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A family-owned business founded in 1906, IEMCO sells, services, repairs and tests motors, generators, hoists, welders and electrical distribution switchgear. IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s main office in Kansas City, Kan., has a fully equipped machine shop. The company also has five other service centers in the region. Because they deal with large motors routinely, IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s personnel are well aware of the severe damage shaft currents can cause to motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mitigating Electrical Bearing Damage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If not diverted, shaft voltages can discharge through bearings, pitting the balls and race walls. Without long-term bearing protection, concentrated pitting at regular intervals along a race wall can cause washboard-like ridges called fluting, a source of noise and vibration. The eventual result is motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ironically, some products designed to protect bearings, such as conventional spring-loaded grounding brushes, require extensive maintenance themselves. Others, such as insulation and ceramic bearings, can shift damage to connected equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To boost the electron-transfer rate, the iPRO&amp;rsquo;s entire inner circumference is lined with multiple rows of conductive microfibers. Locked securely in the ring&amp;rsquo;s patented AEGIS FiberLock channel, these microfibers completely surround the motor shaft, providing millions of discharge points for harmful shaft currents and creating the path of least resistance that effectively diverts these currents away from bearings to ground. The microfibers themselves are specially engineered for exceptional flexibility to prevent breakage and ensure that the ring will last for the life of the motor. Because it prolongs the life of bearings, motors, and motor-driven systems, the iPRO qualifies as sustainable technology under the Federal Energy Management Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nagging, Widespread Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Contractors and retail home-improvement stores in six Midwestern states depend on the Monarch plant, which sends cement by truck and train to its terminals in Des Moines, Iowa, and Dodge City, Kan. The terminals distribute the cement to 13 Monarch subsidiaries, which sell it in their respective areas. Some of the cement is sold in bulk, some in bags. And, some of it is further processed by the subsidiaries, which fabricate building products or add stone and sand to produce ready-mix concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Monarch was founded in 1908, chunks of blasted limestone (&amp;ldquo;shot rock&amp;rdquo;) up to 4 feet across were loaded by hand into mule-drawn carts. Now this limestone is moved by huge front-end loaders, 50-ton dump trucks and conveyors to be processed by a series of computer-controlled crushers, kilns and mills until it is as fine as face powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the processing machinery is powered by electric motors and the problem of chronic bearing damage is by no means limited to the plant&amp;rsquo;s ball mills. Many of the motors are controlled by variable frequency drives (VFDs), which induce additional high-frequency currents on motor shafts. A fan or pump motor tends to use less power if the input is modulated by a VFD, but the benefits of improved efficiency are lost if the motor keeps breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such breakdownswere recurring headaches for Riebel, but because the two AEGIS iPRO rings installed in 2009 appear to be protecting the bearings of the ball-mill motor, he has since had IEMCO install the iPRO on nine more motors that had to be removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A case in point is a VFD-controlled cooler-vent fan where the 300-HP motor had to be replaced frequently for almost eight years. Every time, the kiln had to be shut down for at least a day. The old motor was removed, and the rebuilt spare motor had to be aligned and coupled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d send the pulled motor out to be rebuilt, but then three to six months later we&amp;rsquo;d have to do the same thing all over again,&amp;rdquo; says Riebel. &amp;ldquo;For the cooler vent fan motor we tried insulation on both bearings. With the insulation, the motor lasted two years between breakdowns. The shunted electricity might have hurt the bearings in the fan itself. Insulation just pushes the problem on down the line. The electricity has got to go somewhere if it&amp;rsquo;s not grounded. The iPRO has given this fan a fresh start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t really realize what the problem was,&amp;rdquo; Riebel reflects. &amp;ldquo;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much information available about electrical bearing damage. We just knew that bearings would fail and the motor would overheat, but we were not looking to see why. Again and again, we just sent the motor out, got it rebuilt, and put it back in service. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know the root cause.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solved by an Innovative, Green Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is now Monarch policy to have IEMCO add the iPRO ring in the shop whenever a VFD-controlled Monarch fan motor is overhauled.Another such installation was on the 2,250-horsepower motor for an ID (induced-draft) fan that pulls kiln-heated air through a roller mill, to dry the limestone and shale during the raw grinding process. Other motors that now have iPROs include four at the plant&amp;rsquo;s kilns, where air is forced in and out: two 2,000-HP ID fan motors and two 1,000-HP baghouse (dust-collecting) fan motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, because a cement plant is a very dusty place and many motors are outdoors, Monarch has begun to specify that some of its new motors must come equipped with theAEGIS Severe-Duty SGR Bearing Isolator Shaft Grounding Ring, another Electro Static Technology product. As in the iPRO, the secured conductive microfibers of the AEGIS Severe-Duty SGR completely surround the motor shaft for efficient grounding, but this model has a built-in IP56 noncontact isolation seal to provide extra protection from dust, water, and other contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Monarch&amp;rsquo;s maintenance manager, Mark Pily, authorized the purchase of the plant&amp;rsquo;s first motor with a factory-installed Severe-Duty SGR, after consultingIEMCO&amp;rsquo;s Wilkins. As of this writing, a 200-HP air-compressor motor is the only such motor in operation at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We want to keep the bearings clean because we push that motor really hard,&amp;rdquo; Riebel explains. &amp;ldquo;We usually lose that motor because of winding failure. I think most of that is caused by the bearings starting to fail, which causes the motor to overload.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ounce of Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Using a voltage probe and oscilloscope, Riebel periodically takes shaft voltage readings on all the plant&amp;rsquo;s motors with grounding rings. He is pleased with the results because the readings are low, indicating that the rings have reduced potentially damaging shaft voltages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel also gives a high grade to the service the plant has received from IEMCO: &amp;ldquo;In my opinion, they are by far the best shop we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with, and we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with most every shop in the area. Scott (Wilkins) is really involved. He&amp;rsquo;s really a get-it-right-the-first-time kind of person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time will tell exactly how much money the rings will save Monarch overall, but Riebel is convinced the AEGIS iPRO provides effective, long-term bearing protection that reduces the costs of downtime and motor maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;So far, so good,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;On the 5,000-horsepower, since the last set of bearings only lasted a year, chances are we would have noticed problems by now, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any &amp;ndash; no squealing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken names Folger to lead global quality organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company has named Russell F. Folger as vice president for quality advancement. He assumes the leadership role formerly held by Donna J. Demerling, who retires at the end of December after a 38-year career at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Folger has held the position of director of global quality since 2007, overseeing the implementation and management of Timken&amp;rsquo;s Quality Management System, the backbone of the company&amp;rsquo;s robust quality assurance processes. In his new role, he will be responsible for quality management systems and quality assurance throughout the company, including business processes, product design, manufacturing, supply chain and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Quality is a core value at Timken. Customers around the world rely on us wherever parts move and turn in their most critical applications,&amp;rdquo; said James W. Griffith, president and chief executive officer. &amp;ldquo;Russ brings more than 30 years of customer engineering experience to the quality organization and has worked with Timken facilities around the world. In his new role, he will ensure that we continue to live the core value of quality throughout our organization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demerling retires after a long career of engineering and leadership positions with Timken. Since joining the company in 1972 as an application engineer, she held numerous positions of increasing responsibility including president of Timken&amp;rsquo;s aerospace business and senior vice president of supply chain transformation. She also managed bearing manufacturing and distribution operations in Bucyrus, Ohio, and bearing manufacturing in Lincolnton, N.C. She has been vice president of quality since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having a customer focus throughout his career at Timken, Folger joined the company in 1979 as a sales engineer before progressing through a series of global roles in sales and application engineering, including a leadership role in the Yokohama, Japan, sales office and later serving as chief engineer and vice president of engineering for automotive markets. After moving into a leadership role in the quality organization, he worked closely with Donna to ensure a continued focus on quality throughout a time of significant global and product expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Folger earned a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in mechanical engineering from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and completed the executive development for global excellence program at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Timken Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Timken Company keeps the world turning with innovative friction management and power transmission products and services, enabling its customers&amp;rsquo; machinery to perform more efficiently and reliably.

            <title>When troubleshooting equipment, first impressions are important</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt1_rc.jpg" /&gt;When troubleshooting a machinery problem, whether for an unusual vibration problem or a component failure such as a bearing or seal, first impressions from the initial machinery inspection are very important. Any troubleshooting exercise should begin with a thorough investigation of machine history - process, design, operation, maintenance, and all available machine details. These first impressions are necessary to make sure the troubleshooting team is fully armed with important data and minimize the chances of a misdiagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people new to the troubleshooting process have a tendency to immediately pick up tools and start working. A better approach is to put the tools down and collect first impressions. While they might not immediately reveal the problem, they may identify a number of issues that are impacting overall reliability. Recommendations for these initial inspections include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt2_rc.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall cleanliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Good housekeeping often reveals that machinery maintenance practices are held to a higher standard. Look beyond dust to the condition of the base and foundation, piping supports, seal leaks, etc., for evidence of maintenance practices or environmental factors that negatively impact reliability. What are the expectations that a field repair can be conducted without introducing contaminants that will shorten the life of the replacement parts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More detailed machine inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with the machine base and look for obvious signs of decay or improper anchoring. Move up to the feet and inspect the shims and hold-down bolts. Poor practices at the base often reveal a lack of quality of other repairs. Move to the shaft and drive (i.e., couplings, belts, etc.) and look for evidence of shaft damage, improper coupling assembly, and incorrect key length. While issues with these areas may not be the cause of the current problem, improvements made with the required repairs will improve machinery reliability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;If running, perform a basic vibration check:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a simple tool such as &lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/OverhungBase_cropped_rc+copy.jpg" /&gt;coin with serrated edges to obtain an impression of relative machinery movement if the machine is still running. While vibration measurements tend to focus on the bearings, with coin in hand, start at the base and work up to the bearing locations to feel for unusual movement. Pay close attention to boundaries and connections such as the base-to-foundation, machine feet-to-base, and all piping and conduit. A simple condition such as a loose base-bolt can have a dramatic impact on the machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Keep detailed notes of the initial impressions:&lt;/strong&gt; They will provide a comprehensive and professional report on improvements that will impact the life and reliability of the machine. While at the machine site, inspect other equipment in the area for similar issues and carefully present this information to the stakeholders. While no one likes to have their flaws revealed, a good presentation of steps that can be followed to positively impact machinery will be well received.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>PACE Award: Balancer shaft with rolling bearing supports among the finalists</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This year, innovations from Schaeffler are again finalists of the renowned PACE Award. The international jury&amp;rsquo;s focus this year is on the lightweight balancer shaft with rolling bearing supports used in modern internal combustion engines. This award, which is presented annually by Automotive News magazine in cooperation with audit and consulting firm Ernst &amp;amp; Young and the Transportation Research Center (TRC), honors outstanding product innovations of automotive suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Lightweight balancer shafts with rolling bearing supports are enjoying increasing popularity since they contribute to cutting fuel consumption and CO2 emissions and comply with the trends for downsizing and downspeeding of engines associated with this. They increase the smoothness of running of internal combustion engines and reduce fuel consumption. The rolling bearing supports with reduced friction characteristics enable a significant improvement in energy efficiency compared to the plain bearings that were previously used. This means the power consumed internally an four-cylinder diesel engine already in volume production is reduced by up to 1.5 kilowatts (2.0 horsepower). This design, which is increasingly being used in engines, also considerably reduces the requirement for oil cooling and makes the previously obligatory pressure lubrication no longer necessary. This means lightweight balancer shafts with rolling bearing supports are particularly suitable for engines with start-stop systems. The rolling bearing supports also enable a new optimized mass layout of the balancer shafts with a mass that is reduced by around one-third. This means the two balancer shafts mounted in an engine, which run at twice crankshaft speed due to the design, alone reduce engine weight by more than a kilogram. The filigree design minimizes the shaft&amp;rsquo;s rotational inertia and, thus, in turn reduces the driving forces required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The lightweight balancer shaft with rolling bearing supports celebrated its premiere in Daimlers&amp;#39; OM 651 four-cylinder diesel engine, which was awarded Engine of the Year in 2009. The balancer shafts of other modern engines are now equipped with rolling bearing supports such Fiat&amp;#39;s two-cylinder TwinAir engine, which has received this year&amp;#39;s Engine of the Year award. Last year, the lightweight balancer shaft with rolling bearing supports received the Steel Innovation Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Schaeffler Group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With its brands INA, LuK and FAG, it is a renowned supplier to the automotive industry as well as a leading manufacturer of rolling bearings worldwide. Sales of &amp;euro;7.3 billion were generated at over 180 locations in more than 50 countries in 2009.

            <title>Plain or rolling element bearings? What's the correct choice?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Plain bearings are available for an extremely wide variety of applications. Most are used in sliding or oscillating roles: door hinges, ball joints on cars, the &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe34157777600678771070&amp;amp;ls=fde61277766c0d787d1c7375&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe9315787365067973&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t="&gt;fifth wheel on a tractor trailer&lt;/a&gt;. But when full rotation is required, plain bearings change shape to a &amp;quot;sleeve&amp;quot; that fits around the shaft. In addition to being called sleeve bearings, other names include plane, journal or babbitt bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Rolling vs plain" border="0" height="316" id="_x0000_i1025" mdid="593d9fd9-b804-45da-a504-7ed61eaf6b91" src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Rolling+vs+plain.png" title="Rolling vs plain" width="422" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The high startup torque requirement usually means plain bearings aren&amp;#39;t suitable for machines that start and stop frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The full fluid film in plain bearings requires up to 3x more energy to operate, even if startup losses are excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some journal bearings have difficulty with grease lubrication - they need a constantly replenished thick oil film.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Using plain bearings in vertical or thrust loaded applications requires special Kingsbury or Mitchell designs, which can add to cost. Since most rolling element bearings are available in standard sizes, changing the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;type&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of bearing in an application may be all that&amp;#39;s needed to accommodate thrust.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plain bearings are generally optimized for a single speed, while rolling bearings can tolerate a wider speed range, more suitable for variable speed drives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When power density is extremely high, as in power generation, heavy loads might result in permanent, plastic raceway deformation in a rolling element bearing - plain bearings may be a better choice. The &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe33157777600678771071&amp;amp;ls=fde61277766c0d787d1c7375&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe9315787365067973&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t="&gt;API 610 Standard&lt;/a&gt; has guidance for the recommended use of plain bearings vs. rolling element bearings in industrial machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/a-t7udWa3-8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bearing association warns about dangers of counterfeit products</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the last two decades, counterfeiting in general has grown substantially globally. While there has been much reporting about consumers being taken advantage of by counterfeits in music, film, home electronics and designer clothing, a far greater risk lies in industrial counterfeiting of items such as tires, seals and bearings. Many of these products are safety-critical and fake versions may pose a real threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To raise the awareness about this, the World Bearing Association (WBA) has launched a campaign to inform about potential safety hazards arising from counterfeit bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our initiative is aimed at sensitizing the public on the dangers associated with counterfeits,&amp;rdquo; says James W. Griffith, WBA president. &amp;ldquo;The WBA is thus intensifying its anti-counterfeiting initiatives &amp;ndash; that means information for customers on the one hand and consistent prosecution of offenders through the competent authorities on the other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The WBA anti-counterfeiting information campaign will reach out to various audiences through e-mails, Web banners, social media and the campaign site, &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stopfakebearings.com&amp;amp;esheet=6493494&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.stopfakebearings.com&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=864f08bec4cf50a05df54e1d6e26f126" target="_blank"&gt;www.stopfakebearings.com&lt;/a&gt;. At the site, interested consumers can learn more about counterfeiting of bearings and what is being done to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The fight against counterfeiting is not only about protecting the SKF brand but also about protecting our customers and the public from a potentially serious safety risk. Customers are being cheated into paying for a genuine product but are supplied with a fake alternative. Being a part of the World Bearing Association campaign is a way to further reinforce our commitment to fight this illegal activity,&amp;rdquo; says Tom Johnstone, SKF president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Counterfeiting violates trademarks. Because counterfeits look like and are marketed like genuine branded products, it usually takes a trained expert to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Heat and bearings: Coping with shaft expansion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Axial shaft expansion can be an issue in machines that generate or use heat in operation. In industrial hot gas fans, the heat is transmitted through the shaft. In paper machine drying cylinders, hot steam is passed through a hollow shaft directly through the bearing bore. There are a number of ways to allow bearings to handle the linear expansion of a shaft. The most common are:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Locate (fix) one bearing in the housing, and allow the other bearing axial freedom (non-locating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="SRB - SRB Expansion" border="0" height="293" id="_x0000_i1025" mdid="df86f36b-ae08-4d4d-86a7-65aa1f21bac9" src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/SRB+-+SRB+Expansion.jpg" title="SRB - SRB Expansion" width="357" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Choose bearing types that allow one bearing to act as the locating bearing, and allow the other bearing to accommodate the shaft expansion internally. Prevent both bearing outer rings from moving axially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="CARB - SRB Drying Cylinder" border="0" height="193" id="_x0000_i1026" mdid="b97b91ea-7b9c-4084-b30d-9b4166fe7399" src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/CARB+-+SRB+Drying+Cylinder.jpg" title="CARB - SRB Drying Cylinder" width="404" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CARB (SKF&amp;#39;s &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ompact &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ligning &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;oller &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;earing) bearings are capable of accommodating linear expansion, misalignment and heavy loads simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	How much expansion can we expect from a paper machine drying cylinder? Approximately 6 microinches (0.000006&amp;quot;) per 1 degree Fahrenheit, per inch of shaft length. (This expansion rate depends on the material in use; gray cast iron is typical.)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Using the expansion rate above, how much could the shaft grow if there was a temperature rise of 200 degrees F (111 degrees Celsius) in the machine, and the bearings are 400 inches&amp;nbsp;(10.2 meters) from center-to-center?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just multiply the numbers together: 0.000006&amp;quot; /&amp;deg;F / &amp;quot; x 200 &amp;quot; x 400&amp;quot; = 0.480&amp;quot;, or just under 1/2&amp;quot; (~12mm)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are other ways to accommodate thermal expansion. Contact your local SKF Applications Engineering Service for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/kVeEwV3SKrQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf211.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (fig.1) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. Figure 1 shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (Figure 2). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf212.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. Figure 3 shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs. The R0F test rigs have been upgraded (R0F+), making them very flexible in terms of speed, load and temperature. A large number of R0F and R0F+ can be found at the SKF Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center, enabling 140 tests to be carried out simultaneously (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf214.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. Figure 5 shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf215.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (Figure 6) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. Figure 7 plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 8 shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. Table 1 shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties. All three greases are widely used and approved by various wind turbine OEMs. The choice of grease depends on the type of sealing, operating conditions and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf219.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers complete customer solutions for main shaft applications encompassing greases, housings, seals, bearing configurations, lubricating systems, lock nuts, mounting services, lubricants and analyses and condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF is contributing to sustainability and supporting environmentally friendly solutions through further development and application of its knowledge in grease lubrication, thus prolonging the service life of bearing systems and reducing friction, leading to less energy consumption. Extended service life and relubrication intervals lead to less need for maintenance and to a reduction of waste. This is achieved by using the knowledge obtained from fundamental R&amp;amp;D and model development in combination with product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1 &lt;/a&gt;shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@2"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8]. Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs.

&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@5"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@6"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@7"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@8"&gt;Figure 8 &lt;/a&gt;shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@9"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties.

            <title>Bearing analysis kit provides oil and vibration condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit now is available, providing all the necessary equipment and consumables for oil and overall machine vibration condition monitoring. The kit is designed to provide fast, accurate results for multiple oil parameters, on-site maintenance decisions and assessment of overall machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supplied ready to use in a heavy-duty aluminum case, the SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit&amp;rsquo;s main feature is the SKF Machine Condition Advisor (MCA). The MCA simultaneously measures machine vibration signals and temperature to indicate machine health and bearing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complementing the MCA is a test cell, a lubrication assessment tool engineered to provide accurate results for Water-in-Oil (lubricants) and Total Base Number (TBN) tests. The water-in-oil test helps maintain equipment by indicating if water appears in lubricants, which enables intervention that protects the equipment from damage. &amp;nbsp;The Total Base Number provides an indication of the oil&amp;rsquo;s alkaline reserve and ability to neutralize acids from combustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit provides maintenance engineers with a condition monitoring solution that helps with on-site maintenance decisions to more effectively maintain plant equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Torsten Bark, product project manager, SKF. &amp;ldquo;Water contamination can cause various problems in lubricating oils, and the tools in the kit indentify those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the kit contains a Viscostick and Insolubles. The Viscostick provides a simple &amp;ldquo;go/no go&amp;rdquo; result when the distillate fuel dilutions of an SAE 30 to 40 engine oil is tested. The Insolubles detects high insolubles from diesel engine combustion products such as fuel ash, carbon, partially oxidized fuel, oil oxidation products and spent lubrication additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Fractured bearing rings: A crack can ruin your day</title>
            <description>&lt;div align="center"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Tapered+SRB+1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your task at the cement plant today is to replace the worn-out bearings on a large roll used to crush raw material used in production. About an hour after driving up a spherical roller bearing onto the tapered shaft of the roll, you hear a sound - a sharp, metallic sound - resonate throughout the shop. You can&amp;#39;t immediately find the source of the sound. A bit later, as you start lifting the roll to get it into position, the roll rotates, and you can see what happened: There is a crack in the bearing inner ring, straight through the hardened steel, all the way across. There&amp;#39;s the source of that cracking sound!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Investigation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;At first, you suspect material failure - the bearing steel may have had an inclusion or other steel defect below the surface. The hoop stress from mounting the bearing on the tapered seat could have found the weak spot, and caused a fracture. However, there is something else at work here. As you slide the bearing off the shaft, right under the crack location, you notice a small steel chip. The chip is about the size of a fingernail trimming, embedded in the shaft. During mounting, that chip got lodged between the bearing bore and the shaft seat. As you mounted the bearing inner ring on the tapered shaft, the stresses on the ring increased. The steel didn&amp;#39;t fracture right away, it was sneaky. It waited until you were busy with something else and - CRACK! - that was the sound you heard.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This damage would be classified under the &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2315767c640774701d72&amp;amp;ls=fde512767c60027b7217737d&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe9d15787164007c75&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t=" title="ISO 15243"&gt;ISO 15243&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;standard as: Fracture and Cracking: Forced Fracture. The chip created a &amp;quot;stress riser&amp;quot; that focused the force of stretching the inner ring during mounting and exceeded the tensile strength of the steel. The result is a cracked ring - regrettably, a preventable damage.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learned: &lt;/strong&gt;Preventable mistakes can have big consequences. In this case, a more thorough inspection of the shaft surface might have caught the small chip. Better yet, eliminate the source of the chip: physically separate your machinery assembly area from machine repair processes, such as grinding and machining. A minimum distance of 30 feet (about 10 meters) is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/2V8chdjbmkA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF documents $2 billion in customer savings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF president and CEO Tom Johnstone announced September 23 that SKF has documented more than US$2 billion saved by its customers as a result of using SKF solutions. This data was collected over a 10-year period with the close cooperation of customers and the use of a patented SKF program, SKF Documented Solutions Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;SKF is able to combine its vast industry knowledge, products and services to provide solutions that deliver value to our customers. This value can be measured and agreed to by our customers. For the past 10 years, we have done just that,&amp;rdquo; says Vartan Vartanian, SKF Service Division president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on experience from working with 19,000 cases around the world, SKF first developed the SKF Documented Solutions Program to help its customers predict the annual net cost savings they could realize by using SKF products and services. Because of the large quantity of data that has been collected, SKF is in a unique position to be able to quickly and accurately project and then measure the total cost of ownership on specific initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Total cost reductions are shown in areas such as reducing energy, lubrication, inventory, warranty costs, manpower, machine life, reliability, output and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF is a leading global supplier of bearings, seals, mechatronics, lubrication systems and services which include technical support, maintenance and reliability services, engineering consulting and training.

            <title>Timken completes acquisition of QM Bearings and Power Transmission</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company on September 22 announced it has completed the acquisition of QM Bearings and Power Transmission Inc., based in Ferndale, Wash. That location, as well as manufacturing facilities in Prince George, British Columbia, and Wuxi, China, along with distribution facilities in Ontario, Texas, and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, will become part of the Process Industries segment of Timken&amp;#39;s Bearings and Power Transmission Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Timken&amp;#39;s earnings in its first full year with the company. The addition of spherical roller-bearing steel-housed units and elastomeric and steel couplings expands Timken&amp;#39;s capabilities beyond its existing, core lines for especially demanding applications such as sawmill and cement operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We welcome QM associates to Timken&amp;#39;s family of businesses and look forward to serving our customers with a broader offering of high-performance products for demanding power-transmission applications,&amp;quot; said Michael C. Arnold, president of Timken&amp;#39;s Bearings and Power Transmission Group.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF breaks ground for new aeroengine facility in New York</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF will invest around US$18 million in a new heat-treat facility in Falconer, N.Y., as part of an expansion to its aeroengine operations in the country. The new 6,100-square-meter facility will house a new high-tech vacuum furnace for the carburizing and hardening of a variety of materials and is a very critical operation in the bearing manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a groundbreaking ceremony that included dignitaries from the State of New York and the local community, Tom Johnstone, SKF president and CEO, remarked, &amp;quot;We are very pleased to dedicate the construction commencement of this significant investment in SKF&amp;#39;s operations in Falconer. This new facility enables us to bring the nearby Jamestown operations to the Falconer campus, and implement a state-of-the-art heat treat operation with cutting edge technology. While SKF is making a significant investment in this project, it would not have been possible without the dedicated support of the State of New York and the various organizations. This is something the local community can take great pride in securing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;This is a tremendous investment in New York State&amp;#39;s manufacturing base and one that helps solidify SKF&amp;#39;s long-term viability in Chautauqua County,&amp;quot; said New York Governor David A. Paterson. &amp;quot;I applaud Tom Johnstone and his team and would like thank SKF for their continued commitment to the southern tier of Western New York.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new SKF heat-treating facility is expected to commence production in the spring of 2011 and will process parts for four SKF Aerobearing operations in the U.S., as well as for Venture Aerobearings, SKF&amp;#39;s joint venture with GE, in Charleston, S.C. The facilities in Falconer and Jamestown have 691 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Aeroengine North America business unit is a leader in high precision, custom-engineered ball and roller bearings for critical aeroengine and specialty applications, including ball and roller bearings for helicopters, main shaft and gearboxes for jet engines and various types of aircraft power assemblies. Specialty products are custom-designed bearings for technically and environmentally demanding applications such as pumps, motors and power transmission assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing damage: When is a dent not a dent?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When machinery failures happen, accurate identification of the true failure mechanism is crucial.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Dented+Ring+Pic+1.jpg" /&gt;The image reveals blunt force impacts to the bearing ring and raceways. The hammer marks on the ring side face (ISO 15243:2004, Plastic Deformation / Indentation by Handling) are pretty easy to fix &amp;ndash; take away the hammer. The triangular marks on the bearing raceway are something different, but the root cause is the same.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/True+Brinell+Pic+2.jpg" /&gt;Under low-power (3x to 5x) magnification, the manufacturer&amp;#39;s grinding and honing marks are easily seen inside and outside the dented area. Permanent, plastic deformation leaves the triangular shaped mark, but the impact damage remains clear (ISO 15243:2004: Plastic Deformation / Overload.) &amp;ldquo;True brinelling&amp;rdquo; is another term for this damage.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If we observed wear, perhaps rust, and an absence of hone marks in the bottom of the &amp;ldquo;dents&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re probably looking at false brinelling (ISO 15243:2004: Corrosion / Frictional Corrosion / False Brinelling.)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Pic+3+rounded+corners.jpg" /&gt;This wear process happens to stationary machines subject to vibration. The rollers break through the oil film and wear indentations in the raceway at roller spacing. This &amp;ldquo;dent&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t produced by impact, and the root cause - typically external vibration &amp;ndash; must be tracked down and eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the origins of bearing damage allows us to develop and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence of failure.

            <title>Vibration analysis is like winning the lottery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ah, to be able to predict the winning numbers in a lottery &amp;ndash; who hasn&amp;rsquo;t had that dream! Life would be so easy and carefree with a crystal ball. And, would not your maintenance job be so much simpler if you could just identify machine damage in time and predict the point at which repairs really become necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to DIN 31051, condition-oriented maintenance is not limited to inspection, servicing, determination of the machine condition and maintenance scheduling. It also encompasses predicting the length of service life remaining for machines and systems. This means it is not always necessary to replace a rolling bearing when an inspection measurement reveals inner raceway frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article describes how it was possible to keep a damaged bearing running for several months until the scheduled annual outage came around &amp;ndash; naturally under close observation. Periodic measurements had shown that there had only been a slight change in the envelope spectrum. But one thing at a time &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, a contractor was awarded a contract for the mobile condition measurement of a double-shaft extruder gear. So, before the diagnostic specialist carries out measurements on location, the gear construction data is established by way of the factory number and the bearing frequencies are calculated for the entire drive (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca111.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this purpose, the contractor used a computer program that recognizes almost all gear types, including variable speed drives. Having calculated the excitation frequencies, the diagnostic specialist visits the customer to determine the current condition of the drive &amp;ndash; which in this case was already 7 years old &amp;ndash; and to find any deviations. Beginning bearing damage was identified during control measurement as a result of the distinct, albeit not yet critical, vibrations of an inner raceway frequency that were picked up in the input shaft area. The gear condition was recorded and the recommendation to procure replacement parts for the intermediate shaft was made to the operator. Repeated monthly measurements were recommended to assess whether the bearing needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows two envelope spectra that were recorded three months apart at the same measuring point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Measured Values Recorded at a Three-month Interval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because changes were only slight, an immediate replacement of the bearing was not deemed necessary, and the decision was made to continue operation until the scheduled annual outage. The bearing was exchanged five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca113.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Dismantling the Intermediate Shaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon dismantling the bearing, the damage diagnosed on the inner raceway could be confirmed as expected &amp;ndash; nine months after initial diagnosis. Pittings are clearly visible on the inner raceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca114.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The extruder was back in operation two days later as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In hindsight, both the diagnosis and the predicted remaining service time proved to be correct and economically wise. Expensive &amp;ldquo;crash repair&amp;rdquo; was unnecessary in this case. And, avoiding downtime was almost like picking a &amp;ldquo;winning number&amp;rdquo; in the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PPL Montana leans on supplier for maintenance training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When Hank Coffin wanted to improve the performance of his maintenance team, he started with the basics. Keeping a power plant up and running is critical for more than just that company and its profits &amp;ndash; thousands of people depend on it for their electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coffin, a manager at PPL Montana&amp;rsquo;s Colstrip Steam Electric Station in the southeastern part of the state, realized that keeping his plant &amp;ndash; and its four generators &amp;ndash; running requires understanding the value and impact of proper maintenance and repair. So, he decided to contact Timken to flesh out the needs of PPL Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help fine-tune operations at PPL Montana, Timken worked with Coffin to set up an onsite training program that would help his maintenance team learn techniques to extend bearing life, reduce costs and improve equipment reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Providing our customers the opportunity to continue their education in best maintenance and repair practices is a value-adding service that can deliver exceptional results,&amp;rdquo; said Jeff Calvin, Timken section manager for service engineering &amp;ndash; bearings. &amp;ldquo;The Timken Bearing Certification program helps us to make them better at their everyday practices, which improve operations and performance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The program is a tool used to help customers focus on each area of maintenance and learn techniques for good practice. Customized to each customer&amp;rsquo;s unique needs, some key areas of the training include review of proper bearing storage, handling, inspection, and installation and removal processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Re-educating his team at PPL Montana, Coffin can see the impact of the training on a number of levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I realized that all of our guys didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same level of training and knowledge, so the benefits of the program have reached a number of layers to improve our overall operations,&amp;rdquo; said Coffin. &amp;ldquo;Our steam plant mechanics and operators, supervisors and PE-licensed engineers have all learned from the program. And with everyone on the same page, we have a lot better success with bearings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following the onsite training and auditing, PPL Montana earned the &amp;ldquo;Timken bearing certified&amp;rdquo; designation, reserved for world-class maintenance operations. Since beginning training, the more than 1,100-megawatt coal-fired power plant has significantly improved uptime and maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through improved education and knowledge of maintenance practices, PPL Montana also has gained a first-hand look at the benefits of bearing repair vs. bearing replacement. Understanding the bearing and its environment assists in recognizing the need for scheduled repairs before breakdowns cause delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Learning the benefits of bearing repair are reflected in both performance and the bottom line,&amp;rdquo; said Coffin. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a definite improvement in the availability of equipment and are saving one-third to one-half the cost of buying new since we&amp;rsquo;ve started capitalizing on bearing repair.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s more important is that Timken doesn&amp;rsquo;t care if it&amp;rsquo;s their bearing or that of a competitor,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;Either way, they help us fix the problem; and because of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained a new respect for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Don't hit that bearing! Proper instructions for cold mounting</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cold mounting is the most basic way to mount a cylindrical bore bearing on a straight shaft. The term &amp;quot;cold mounting&amp;quot; implies taking the bearing out of the box and pushing it onto the shaft without using heat to expand the bearing.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Although this is an effective mounting method used by many, extra care must be taken because today&amp;#39;s bearings are more precise and potentially susceptible to damage if mounted improperly.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are some tips to help you avoid common mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the three-inch rule: Never cold mount a bearing with an&amp;nbsp;inside diameter larger than three inches (75 millimeters).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When cold mounting smaller bearings, always apply 360-degree support on the ring being mounted and apply even pressure. For example, never mount a bearing on the shaft by applying pressure to the outer ring.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bearings with inside diameter larger than&amp;nbsp;three inches (75 mm) should be heated before mounting.&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_175E" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEVER directly strike any bearing. Bearing steel is very hard and brittle, and can shatter on impact. &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2d157672640d78741772&amp;amp;ls=fdea127676610278731d7173&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe9115787761027d7d&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t=" title="Don't hit that bearing!"&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; to find out what you can do to avoid personal injury or damage to your bearings.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Timken to acquire QM Bearings and Power Transmission</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company on July 19 announced it has agreed to acquire the business of QM Bearings and Power Transmission, Incorporated, based in Ferndale, Wash. QM manufactures spherical roller bearing steel housed units and elastomeric and steel couplings used in demanding processes such as sawmill and logging operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of QM aligns with Timken&amp;rsquo;s strategy to expand its penetration in high-performance applications and extend its power transmission capabilities beyond the company&amp;#39;s original, core bearing business. The acquisition is part of the company&amp;rsquo;s continuing effort to provide customers with a wider breadth of friction management and power transmission solutions for the life of their machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	QM&amp;rsquo;s product offering will complement Timken&amp;rsquo;s recently released Type E product line. It will strengthen the presence of the Timken brand in the roller housed unit category and provide an additional offering for markets such as forestry, which require high-performance, durable products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;QM is a great addition for Timken, with a solid, value-added product line that extends our portfolio to offer a wider selection of high-performance products for our customers in the process industries,&amp;quot; said Chris Coughlin, president of Timken&amp;#39;s Process Industries segment. &amp;quot;These units are an excellent fit with our existing product line and Timken&amp;#39;s focus on distribution will provide greater opportunity as we extend them further in the global aftermarket channel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acquisition, which is expected to be accretive to earnings in its first full year, is subject to certain government and regulatory approvals. Timken expects to close the transaction by the fourth quarter of 2010. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	QM Bearings and Power Transmission was founded in 1951 as a manufacturer serving area sawmill and logging customers.&amp;nbsp; The company then began to design and manufacture bearings that could withstand the harsh operating conditions common to logging equipment. In the past 12 months, QM posted sales of more than $14 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Timken Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Timken Company is a manufacturer and supplier of innovative friction management and power transmission products and services. The company had sales of $3.1 billion in 2009, has operations in 26 countries/territories and has approximately 17,000 employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/vT25d_ugoVY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Electric motors tip on shaft currents and bearing defects</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Shaft voltages and currents that can affect bearing life have been identified and described in papers dating back to the early 1900s. Various causes such as accidental potential applied to a motor frame, electrostatic charging, shaft magnetization, electric dissymmetry, and common mode voltage can each be responsible for these damaging effects. The rotor, bearings and frame act as a secondary loop for induced currents to flow through the bearings, or via a capacitive network, voltage exists between the rotor and the iron on the stator frame developing a path across the bearing to ground. This common mode voltage can build up on the rotor and shaft to a level where it will arc over at the bearing in an effort to get to ground. When the motor is running slow, the contact of the balls and the race of the bearing allow for a continuous flow of current through the bearing and prevent any voltage build up or arc. However, when the motor is running faster, a thin film of grease will separate the balls from the outer race allowing for a buildup and potentially damaging arc across the conductive grease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solutions to this problem are isolated bearings, shaft grounding and non-conductive grease. Less popular solutions include Faraday shields, individually tuned filters and very expensive special inverter designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Great River Energy station saves on journal bearing maintenance </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Steve Richter faced a challenge. As boiler core leader, responsible for the maintenance and reliability of the boiler area equipment at Great River Energy&amp;rsquo;s Coal Creek Station in North Dakota, he needed to reduce costs related to replacing tapered journal bearings within the facility&amp;rsquo;s pulverizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past, he replaced worn bearings with new and refurbished bearings from a variety of suppliers. Richter needed a more comprehensive, economical approach to journal bearing maintenance. Timken market manager Todd Thorsen and representatives from Motion Industries&amp;rsquo; Bismarck, N.D., branch joined forces to propose a three-year plan for replacing bearings at the Coal Creek Station. It combines three services, creating one resource for Coal Creek to obtain tapered roller bearings, bearing repair and competitive pricing on new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We developed a bundled bearing replacement program where Motion Industries would deliver a steady supply of new and used bearings,&amp;rdquo; says Thorsen. &amp;ldquo;Our goal was to save Coal Creek Station money, maintain performance and avoid production delays.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The replacement program feature that most impresses Richter is Timken&amp;rsquo;s documented repair criteria and associated costs for each repair level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coal Creek stores both new and repaired bearings on-site, but turns to Timken for inspections and repairs. The used bearings are checked to determine the necessary repairs needed to maintain reliable service. Under this program, bearings can be either repaired on-site or they can be sent out for repair at any Timken Industrial Services site, such as the South Bend, Ind., facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Repair costs fall under one of these three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Type 1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Polish cup, cone and rollers. Preserve, package and ship to customer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 (minor)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Grind cup and polish cone, rollers and all other surfaces. Adjust stack height as required. Preserve, package and ship to customer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 (major)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Grind cup and cone raceways. Replace rollers, cage pins and rings and polish all other surfaces. Adjust stack height as required. Preserve, package and ship to customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the repairs are complete, the refurbished bearings are returned to Coal Creek and used as necessary. When bearings can no longer be reconditioned, used bearings are replaced with new Timken tapered bearings. Although not usually required, Timken representatives are available to be on-site to help with maintenance when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="10" src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken21.jpg " vspace="10" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also making Timken&amp;rsquo;s bearing repair capabilities attractive to customers is its willingness to repair bearings manufactured by the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I also was pleased to learn that Timken Industrial Services repairs any brand of bearing,&amp;rdquo; says Richter. &amp;ldquo;This allowed me to send all of the repair work to one location, making my job easier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Elk River, Minn., Great River Energy is the second-largest electric utility in the state based on generating capacity, and is the fifth-largest generation and transmission cooperative in the U.S. in terms of assets. Great River provides wholesale electric service to 28 cooperatives that distribute electricity to more than 600,000 homes, businesses and farms in Minnesota and neighboring states.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The demands placed on bearings for wind power plants are extremely high. Therefore, the procedures for bearing selection and lifetime calculations are fundamentally different than selecting bearings in other application areas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	When selecting bearings for industrial use, design engineers can choose bearings for a defined bearing location relatively easily, working together with their suppliers if necessary, and basing their decisions on parameters such as rotary speed and torque, radial and axial load, and the required rigidity and preload or clearance. The wide range offered by complete providers such as NSK means that the right bearing is always available, even for unusual applications or special operating conditions. If this is not the case, special customized bearings can also be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Exacting requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In wind power technology, the procedures leading up to the selection of a bearing are fundamentally different, essentially because of a single parameter: the bearing lifetime. The manufacturers of wind power plants and the gears for those plants require a bearing lifetime of 20 years (i.e. 175,000 hours) for their bearings. This is already an extreme value, but it does not cover all requirements. In addition, it must be taken into account that external loads acting on the bearing are highly dynamic (that is, irregular) because of the wind. The unfavorable environmental conditions for offshore facilities, used ever more frequently, are another factor: sea air is highly corrosive. For generator plants, electrical corrosion must also be taken into account. Finally, the service options available to wind farm operators are extremely limited, and any unscheduled downtime for a bearing will result in significant costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The importance of calculating lifetime &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Just calculating the lifetime of this type of bearing requires a large degree of expertise. This is why selecting bearings for wind power plants is more complex than in other areas of use. Numerous parameters must be taken into account. Besides the bearing loads and the rotational speeds in the application context, design engineers must consider the construction in which the bearing will be placed &amp;ndash; i.e. the configuration of the shaft and housing, their materials, and their tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on this data, first the conventional, standardized calculations are made in accordance with DIN ISO 281, also known as the catalog method. The parameters are bearing load, rotational speed, load capacity and bearing type. In further calculations, parameters such as temperature, lubrication and purity of the oil also are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Greater precision than required by the standard &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Appendix 4 of DIN ISO 281 assumes a simplified bearing geometry as the basis for calculating the modified reference lifetime. In most cases, this sort of calculation is adequate. However, in the wind power industry, more precise values are preferred. NSK has developed its STIFF software for this purpose. In calculating the bearing lifetime, STIFF also takes into account the exact internal geometry, the running clearance and preload, deformation of the shaft-bearing system, and the load zone and load distribution between rolling elements and bearing raceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this model, the rolling elements are divided into slices. An individual, modified reference bearing lifetime is determined for every slice. A more realistic indication of the total bearing lifetime is obtained based on the share of time for each load case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Targeted design optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Apart from fast and precise calculation of the bearing lifetime, the STIFF software also allows short-term version analyses and thus optimization of existing designs. In addition, special adaptations of the bearing can be tested quickly. This particular advantage is frequently exploited: Customized bearings are often used in wind power technology precisely because of the exacting requirements. Furthermore, predictions of rigidity, estimation of efficiency loss, and investigation of operational safety are part of the calculation objectives pursued by the NSK Wind Energy unit when selecting bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Engineering to the fore: Intensive cooperation with customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Given the amount of data that must be taken into account in this area and the demanding bearing lifetime requirements, it is not surprising that such projects are always executed in close cooperation with the customer. Along with engineering, testing also plays an important role. NSK has designed bearing test rigs that allow simulation of dynamic loads and motion. These include, for example, a large bearing test rig capable of applying dynamic forces and moments from the rotor load, and a test rig for simulating acceleration and deceleration and braking procedures for rapidly rotating roller bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Super-TF technology for wind power technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Aside from the selection of the bearing design, the choice of material also plays a crucial role: A bearing lifetime of 175,000 hours, for example, under unfavorable conditions and dynamic loads can only be achieved through the use of special materials. That is why NSK has drawn on its many years of material expertise to develop special materials suitable for extreme operating conditions. One such development is the Super-TF technology. This technology deploys a high-purity bearing steel combined with a special heat treatment technology, guaranteeing an optimized retained austenite content. This material ensures that any foreign matter that penetrates the bearing generates less stress in the material than in conventional steel. As a result, damage from impurities occurs less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bearings made from this material and used with a clean lubricant have roughly twice the lifetime. The Super-TF technology can be used for a large range of bearing types, such as cylindrical roller bearings, which are among the most frequently used bearing types in wind power technology, as well as for tapered and spherical roller bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Different types of bearings &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In modern wind power plants of the megawatt and multi-megawatt classes, multi-stage planetary gears and differential gears primarily provide the necessary speed reduction of the main power train. In this case, design engineers must select not just the appropriate bearing type but also determine the type of bearing arrangement. Bearing assemblies with fixed and free-end bearings, an adjusted bearing assembly or a floating bearing assembly are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every bearing type has certain advantages and disadvantages. An adjusted bearing assembly that allows precise guidance of the shaft, particularly in the axial direction, therefore runs the risk of reciprocal tensioning. Therefore, bearing assembly types such as tapered roller bearings, which allow axial forces to be accommodated in at least one direction along with radial forces, must be selected here. The same applies to floating bearing assemblies, in which the shaft can move axially for a certain distance. Fixed and floating bearing assemblies are used, for example, in bearing designs for planet carrier and planet wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New designs for main gears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to the trend for higher and higher performance and offshore facilities, new drive and gear designs also present design engineers with new challenges. NSK is working closely with the manufacturers of wind power plants and their drive components. The goal is to help develop new designs (that increase the efficiency of wind turbines or reduce weight in the nacelle, for example) for the market quickly and give their users a competitive advantage. NSK has the advantage of more than 20 years experience in developing bearings for the wind power industry an advantage that also benefits users of bearings outside the wind power sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF provides tips on troubleshooting bearing temperatures</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Failed+SRB.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A simple rule for troubleshooting bearing temperatures: No more than 180 degrees&amp;nbsp;Fahrenheit&amp;nbsp;(82 degrees Celsius) on the housing. The bearing outer ring can be up to 20&amp;deg;F (11&amp;deg;C) hotter than the housing. The lubricant originally specified for the application was likely selected to run at lower temperatures. A temperature increase of 50&amp;deg;F (28&amp;deg;C) may cause oil viscosity to drop by 50% or more. This could be the &amp;quot;tipping point&amp;quot; for the application, causing it to go from a hot (but stable) condition, to a hotter, unstable condition where thermal runaway occurs. Eventually, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much lubricant you add to the application: the oil film is too thin inside the bearing to prevent metal-to-metal contact. Friction and heat build up, which could lead to catastrophic machinery seizure.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A better procedure for &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; bearings would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Check the housing surface temperature. It might be OK, even though most people find anything over 130&amp;deg;F (55&amp;deg;C) too hot to touch.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Slowly add the proper amount of fresh grease to the application (use &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe1c1576706d077b7d1178&amp;amp;ls=fdf012767461027e71127776&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe8e1578776402757d&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t=" title="SKF Dialset"&gt;SKF Dialset&lt;/a&gt;). If it&amp;#39;s a motor or other machine with a grease relief, open the relief and allow excess grease to escape.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor the temperature and make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t run away. (You&amp;#39;ll often get a temperature spike after adding grease as the bearing ejects the excess into the housing. This might take 30 minutes to several hours to stabilize, depending on the size of the machine.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the temperature keeps going up, call for help - you will probably have to shut down and investigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Catastrophic failures can have untold consequences. Contact SKF to apply our Knowledge Engineering to your application - we can help you with temperature issues in bearings. A simple call could save you time, money, and perhaps someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/IaW7bNS5dls" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Timken unveils reliability-enhancing solution for multi-megawatt turbines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The wind energy industry&amp;rsquo;s trend toward multi-megawatt turbines, whether onshore or offshore, presents particular challenges when it comes to reliability. For Timken, it is an opportunity to put 110 years of engineering history to work on the ultimate &amp;ldquo;app&amp;rdquo;: a new series of massive, ultra-large tapered roller bearings based on the revolutionary invention company founder Henry Timken patented in 1898.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Imagine how Henry Timken would delight in seeing the evolution of his tapered roller bearings to drive wind turbines, with outer diameters upwards of 3 meters (9 feet),&amp;quot; said Hans Landin, Timken&amp;#39;s director of process original equipment and wind energy. &amp;quot;The fundamental engineering of the UltraWind Series is similar to the original. Yet the application &amp;frac34;in a turbine erected high on a wind tower, in extreme conditions with unpredictable loads &amp;ndash; demands a system approach combining tapered roller bearings with integrated seals, lubrication and condition monitoring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the highest life ratings in the industry verified by Germanischer Lloyd, the new UltraWind Series of bearings provides a cost-conscious, simplified drivetrain for main-shaft wind turbine designs (both gear and gearless). For multi-megawatt turbines, the pre-loaded tapered roller bearing type is better suited than other bearing types to address concerns such as stresses, rigidity and load management that affect bearing life and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken&amp;#39;s UltraWind Series of bearings provides superior stiffness to manage motion of the main shaft and rotor. Its bearing raceway profiles are designed to control maximum stress levels for enhanced durability and the cage is optimized for capacity and roller retention, including both steel and polymer configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The UltraWind Series is part of an integrated main-shaft system solution designed to customers&amp;rsquo; specific operating requirements. In close collaboration with customers, Timken takes into account the total operation of the bearing and power-drive system to optimize the sustainable life of the equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/mQaLDAo17bc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Wind energy turbine producer achieves solid cost savings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	By employing a program of material substitution and longer-life lubrication technology, NSK has achieved cost savings of &amp;euro;337,600 for a manufacturer of micro wind turbines. Moreover, the manufacturer is also benefiting from extended product life, improved reliability and reduced maintenance as a result of replacing mixed-brand bearing products with NSK&amp;rsquo;s premium-brand bearings and long-life grease.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A major bearing supplier to the wind turbine sector, NSK became involved in the micro wind turbine project because the customer was experiencing problems due to the prohibitive cost of bearings. The manufacturer was facing a stark choice: improve the purchasing and manufacturing costs for the project, or it would not continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An NSK engineer visited the customer to review the machine design. This highlighted several areas where unit build cost could be reduced substantially. Following the visit, a supporting design justification report, and bearing and grease life calculations were produced. These not only underpinned the design cost reductions, but also promised benefits such as simplified assembly procedures, and improvements in overall bearing performance, reliability and bearing life.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The customer acted upon NSK&amp;rsquo;s recommendations, substituting NSK premium-brand single-row radial ball bearings, where before there had been a selection of mixed-brand products, including single-row radial ball bearings and angular contact bearings. The NSK bearings are lubricated by NSK&amp;rsquo;s long-life grease, which delivers a grease life of more than 200,000 hours compared to a grease life of 22,400 hours for the mixed-brand bearing package. This improvement in grease life has enabled major reductions in maintenance to be achieved, helping to keep the micro turbine in service substantially longer. The quantification of this improvement, in conjunction with the additional improvements gained from the NSK package, has been calculated by the customer to exceed &amp;euro;337,000.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NSK is producing similar cost saving results across all industry sectors. The company&amp;rsquo;s cost-saving program looks at all aspects of bearing systems: design, specific problem applications, lubrication and even training issues.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The process often starts with a site survey, which is very detailed. NSK engineers visit a customer&amp;rsquo;s premises, talk to them and get to understand what the difficulty is. Data acquired from the visit is subsequently analyzed, leading to recommendations for improvements. These improvements are then quantified in cost terms, demonstrating the level of savings that can be expected by the customer as a result of adopting the solution proposed by NSK.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSK in Wind Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As a major supplier to manufacturers of wind turbines, NSK understands the specific application problems of bearings used in all areas of wind energy generators. The company is at the forefront of developments to produce bearings that reduce size and save weight in the latest generation of multi-stage planetary/helical gearboxes that extend the development of wind energy plants into the multi-megawatt area (i.e. up to 5 megawatts) and above.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;The Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				To assess the problem and get the roll press operational as quickly as possible, Timken assembled a team of experts and placed key engineers on-site at Roanoke to develop a customized solution.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&amp;ldquo;Timken has the most reliable field service any mill could ask for,&amp;rdquo; said Moe Petty, maintenance supervisor at Roanoke Cement. &amp;ldquo;From the sales representative to the engineers, they supported our mill through the situation to restore the unit to full operation. I know Timken service is excellent because there&amp;rsquo;s a true partnership to provide the custom solution for our mill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Timken and Roanoke Cement&amp;nbsp;worked together&amp;nbsp;over several weeks to:&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					Inspect the raceway surfaces and a section of outer ring from a roll press bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					Assist with the removal of a double row spherical roller bearing from the roll press.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					Assist with reconditioning a damaged housing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					Assist with on-site installation of a replacement bearing reconditioned by Timken.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Detect machine problems early: Best practices for operators</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When working around equipment for a long time, it is easy to become accustomed to it working as it should. It can make us numb to potential problems, especially if they come on gradually. This article will present some techniques that will allow you to detect problems early, and hopefully eliminate downtime and/or reduce maintenance costs. Further, it will give insight into what is in common driven equipment and their drivers. How a centrifugal and positive displacement pump works will be explained in the simplest of terms. Some important relationships of flow, heat and horsepower are highlighted so troubleshooting can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This article will outline lubrication systems, bearings, drivers, and both centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. The one secret to detecting problems early is to know what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; is. The operator is one of the few people who knows how a piece of equipment is supposed to sound, what the pressure normally produced is, and what the equipment feels like when it is doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Types of lubrication systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Splash &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; This type of lubrication system is one that usually consists of a reservoir of oil and some part of the spinning shaft and attachment, or the rolling elements of the bearing, that touch the oil and cause it to splash to allow lubrication to take place. There is a place to check the oil level, and it is most important for operators to ensure there is oil.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ring&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This lubrication is accomplished by use of a large ring, usually brass, riding on the turning shaft. It dips down into the oil reservoir and, by viscous drag, brings oil up onto the shaft where it is distributed along the shaft to the bearing. As above, there is a place to check the oil level and it is most important for operators to ensure that oil is present. There also is usually a place to look at the ring while the piece of equipment is running. This should be viewed often to ensure the ring is turning; if the ring stops, the lubrication also will stop.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Circulating &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; In this type of lubricating system, there is usually a reservoir, a pump, a filter, and it may or may not have a heat exchanger. It supplies oil to the lubricated item at very low or essentially no pressure. It is used when a control flow of clean lubricant is necessary to one or more places that may not be at the same level as the reservoir. It is very similar to a forced-feed lubrication system but uses its pump to circulate oil only. Check the level in the reservoir and the color of the lubricant. If there are changes, the question &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; should always come to mind. If there is a heat exchanger, it should be clean. In Figure 1, the circulating system heat exchanger should be cleaned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Forced&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This system is very similar to the circulating system, but it does operate at a system pressure. It usually has a pressure regulating valve to maintain pressure on the system, and it has coolers, multiple pumps, a pressure regulator, auto start of the standby pump, filters and a reservoir. This system is required to remain at pressure or the equipment to which it is supplying lubrication will fail. There are usually safety switches that will cause the lubricated piece of equipment to shut down if the level in the tank falls below a set amount, or if the pressure in the system becomes too low. In addition to the checks of the circulating system, additional checks should be made, such as: &amp;ldquo;Are both the main and auxiliary oil pumps running?&amp;rdquo; If so, why? What is the system pressure? Is it normal? Touch the discharge side of the relief valve on the discharge of the pump. Is it relieving? It should not be. See Figure 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Oil mist&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a system that consists of a tank, tubing and piping to each item being lubricated, an atomizer, and various safety devices relating to flow and level in the reservoir. With this system, there may or may not be a level in the lubricated piece of equipment. There are two general types of mist systems. One is pure mist where there is no lubricant reservoir in each piece of equipment. The other type is a purge mist system where there is a level in the lubricated piece of equipment and oil mist fills the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; space above the reservoir to control that atmosphere. See Figure 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Automatic grease lubricators&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; These are often used to grease inaccessible places. They have a timing mechanism that can be electronic, chemical or mechanical. They may or may not put out much pressure, so they can be prevented from delivering lubricant in some instances. It is important for these lubricators to be marked on their reservoirs with a permanent marker line with the lubricant level and a date as to when the lubricant was at that level. It is one of the few ways to know that lubricant is being put to what is being lubricated. The operator then has a visual reference as to if lubricant is being provided. If the lubricant is being delivered slowly, it should be remarked every few months with a new line and dated to ensure lubricant is being delivered. See Figure 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication is one of the most important aspects of rotating equipment. It is also the neglect of lubrication that causes many pieces of equipment to fail. Lubrication performs the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Entirely separates moving surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removes heat generated within the bearing and/or from an outside source&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Protects metals from corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flushes away contaminants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dampens noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 5 illustrates the difference between full fluid film lubrication with complete separation of surfaces and boundary layer lubrication. Boundary layer lubrication is where there is oil present but not sufficient to keep all surfaces separated, and some wear does take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From an inspection view, it is important to notice the following properties of the lubricant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				It is important to notice changes in the lubricant, smell, color and level.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the reservoir is small and an oil leak is detected, check the level immediately as not much leakage can be tolerated before the level is dangerously low.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the color has changed significantly from yesterday, or what you know to be normal, find out why.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Ensure that levels are maintained. This problem will cause equipment to fail catastrophically in a relatively short period of time if not corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the level is increasing, find out why; water may be entering the system. A simple test is to drain some of the lubricant out onto a napkin or paper towel. The oil will be absorbed into towel but the water beads will stand on the oil soaked towel.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bearings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Plain:&lt;/strong&gt; These are a general category of simple bearings. They can also be called sleeved bearings and, in its simplest form, bushings. They consist of a bearing material that is stationary usually and a rotating shaft. They may be lubricated by any of the above methods of lubrication and are a very common bearing, especially in large, heavy, rotored machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One type of plain bearing is called the pillow block bearing. Many of these have water connections going into them for cooling. It normally consists of a water in and water out line on the same side of the bearing and a loop or &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo; on the other side. Many times, these are rubber hoses and after years exposed to the outside elements they can dry and crack, allowing a leak which reduces the cooling water to the bearing. Where these connections enter, the pillow block bearing can become poorly sealed, allowing the elements to enter the bearing oil; or if the hose is leaking, the leakage can enter the bearing oil and result in a bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Rolling element:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a large group of bearings including roller, tapered roller, ball and needle. They can be lubricated by either grease or oil depending on the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. If a frictionless type of bearing is known to be hot, do not put a water hose on it. The water could get into the lubricant and the cooling water on the outer housing will shrink. The result will likely be the elimination of internal clearances and may cause the bearing to seize immediately. Figure 6 lists numerous bearing types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Motors: &lt;/strong&gt;This is likely the most common type of driver for not only pumps but many other types of equipment found in industry. They consist of two major components. The rotating element inside the motor is called the rotor, and the stationary housing is called the stator. The stator has the electrical wiring in it, and most industry uses three-phase power. From an operations point of view, the three-phase power means that if any two leads are moved to a new mounting location externally at the connection to the power source, the direction of the motor will be reversed. This is really important because many types of equipment must turn in one direction. That is why the direction of rotation is checked before the coupling is installed between the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		As a general rule, if you touch a motor and it is too hot to keep your hand on, it is likely that it is running too hot. The fins on the outside of a motor are to aid with cooling. These should be clean and clear of debris and insulation. A rule of thumb is that motors that run hotter will likely have a shorter life than one running cooler. There are many factors in determining &amp;ldquo;too&amp;rdquo; hot, such as the class of insulation and load on the motor at a given time. The best analysis is done by knowing what is normal and detecting a significant change. When the change is noted, get additional information as to the significance of the change; that would include help from an acknowledged professional as to insulation type and acceptable upper limit of operation. The motor will not fail immediately as the higher temperatures are reached, but running at the higher temperatures is cumulative. It will eventually cause the motor life to be shortened. If you have large motors with an enclosure for outdoors, ensure that the screens or filters that are supposed to be kept clean stay clean. If not, the temperatures will go up and the motor life can be significantly reduced. Figure 7 is a totally enclosed fan-cooled motor (TEFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Steam Turbines:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam turbines are another common driver for industrial equipment. They act like a child&amp;rsquo;s pinwheel in the wind. The turbine may have multiple &amp;ldquo;pinwheels&amp;rdquo;, or stages, and the wind is normally replaced by steam. The shafts are sealed by some means of trying to keep the steam from leaking out to the atmosphere. This is done to save the heated and treated water and to keep the steam from going where you do not want it. If the steam seals are leaking badly, it is not uncommon for the steam to enter the bearing housings and condense. The water will return with the oil to the reservoir. And since the oil pumps draw near the bottom of the tank eventually if allowed to continue, the oil pumps will be circulating water or a mixture of water and oil, which are not good lubricants. If visible steam is seen leaking out, the reservoir should be checked to insure that large quantities of water are not accumulating in the reservoir. Just remember that when visible steam is being seen, check lubricant reservoirs to ensure the water is not displacing the lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If there is cooling water being supplied to the bearing area, touch the inlet and outlet water lines to ensure heat exchange is taking place or at least flow is taking place. Watch for oil leaks as the oil may collect in the insulation and come in contact with the hot piping or casing and a fire will result.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Notice if the turbine seems to vibrate more with it rains that when the day is sunny. The insulation may allow water to enter and cool the casing in an uneven manner, affecting alignment and how smoothly the turbine runs. No one but operators will likely notice the set of cause and affects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Gearboxes:&lt;/strong&gt; These are often used when there is a large difference between the speed of the driver and the driven piece of equipment. From an operator or casual point of view, the items that are most notable when passing are the sound the gear is making and the temperature and vibration of the gearbox to the touch. This needs to be compared to what it has been. Remember, we are looking for changes from what is or accepted as normal. Always check foundation bolts by looking for oil being squeezed in and out between the base plate and the foot of the gearbox. Look at the shims as well. Do they look like they have been squirming out? This is a potential sign of looseness or high vibration at some time. Figure 9 is an example of a parallel shaft gearbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Heat exchangers: &lt;/strong&gt;A heat exchanger is a device built for efficient heat transfer from one medium to another, whether the media are separated by a solid wall so that they never mix, or the media are in direct contact. One of the most common types of heat exchangers in the oil and petrochemical industry is the shell and tube. A severely fowled tube is shown in figure below. The fowling will reduce flow and affect the ability of the exchanger to exchange heat. Figure 10 is an example of a shell and tube heat exchanger and Figure 11 is a badly fowled exchanger tube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Driven: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Only centrifugal and positive displacement pumps will be discussed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Centrifugal pump &lt;/strong&gt;(Figure 12 is a generic centrifugal pump): These are one of the most common types of pumps in industry. They can be of the open or closed impeller type, and may be single or multiple stages. They use the principal of increasing the velocity of the fluid being pumped and Bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle to develop pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps consist of a shaft with bearings for support and an impeller as well as a pump casing and a method of sealing the spinning shaft to keep the liquid being pumped from getting into the atmosphere. The pump has the relationships as listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember in centrifugal pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pressure is increasing on the discharge pressure gauge, the flow is likely decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, then the horsepower required is increasing. That can be shown by increasing amps or kilowatts.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity is increasing, the discharge pressure will fall and the horsepower required to pump the fluid will increase.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR will also increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Typical pump curve&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 13)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Positive displacement pumps&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 14)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		A positive displacement pump is one that, as it turns, liquid is ejected from the pump. As the pump is turned faster, more liquid is ejected from the pump. In this pump, flow on the discharge side of the pump must never be stopped as something will be damaged. There are many types of positive displacement pumps, but no matter how the pump is configured inside, the results are the same. As the pump turns, the liquid must have a place to go.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps have pump curves as do the centrifugal pumps and show much of the same information, but they look differently. Figure 15 is a typical positive displacement pump curve.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember for positive displacement pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the discharge pressure is rising, the horsepower required to pump is also rising.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pump is required to put out more gallons per minute, then the speed of the pump must be increased.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity of the fluid is increasing, then the horsepower required to pump it is also increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR also must increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques available to operators and field people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These inspections are done during rounds. Listen to the equipment and notice differences over time. In motors, a loud hum may mean an internal motor problem or potentially a soft foot condition. If it was quiet yesterday and noisy today, what happened to cause the change? Squealing belts can indicate an overload condition or just loose belts. A scraping sound or rhythmic sound can indicate a dragging or rubbing. A broken tooth on a gearbox may be detected by a clicking or regularly reoccurring sound from inside the gearbox. If a ringing sound is heard, it is important to find the source and ensure that it is not something that will cause a problem with the piece of equipment. Sometimes putting a listening device on a piece of equipment can help identify the source of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Bad or poorly lubricated bearing can be heard using the auditable techniques listed. This is especially useful on frictionless types of bearings. Rubs and other noise-producing maladies can be detected in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Look for leaks; look at fluid levels, burned paint, vibrating shafts or housings. Paint burns at about 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 230 degrees Celsius); and if that is near lubricating oil, then it is likely that the oil has gotten that hot as well. That could mean the condition of the oil is no longer viable as a lubricant. Look at motor fan guards for blockage and the fins on TEFC motors to ensure cooling can take place.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Ensure that pressure gauges are installed and working. The most accurate readings are when the pressure of interest is between the 10 and 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock position on the gauge. It is most important to know what the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; pressure is for any piece of operating equipment. Look for signs of over-lubrication. This condition will not only make a mess, but will shorten equipment life. It is also a potential environmental problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If equipment is ring oiled, it is generally easy to look at the ring while the equipment is running. This is a good check because if the ring stops turning for any reason, it has the same affect as the oil pump stopping in a forced lubrication system. There will be no lubrication for the bearings. (Figure 16)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		After making sure you will not be burned, touch the equipment. Notice if it feels like tingling in your fingers; that would indicate a high-frequency or fast-occurring vibration. Is it hot? Is it hotter than the last time you touched it? Is the hot spot localized or generally hot all over? The temperature on the outside of bearing housings is generally less than the temperature of the bearing itself. The actual temperature of the bearing will be about 30 to 50 degrees F (2 to 10 C) higher than the outside temperature. If a seal pot is used, touch the two lines going to the seal gland. If circulation is taking place, one should be hotter than the other&amp;nbsp;; it is a way to know that circulation is taking place. If a pump has multiple filters on it, touching the outlet of the pump and then each filter down stream, it is possible to determine which one is in service. If a pressure relief valve is leaking through, it can be detected by touching the discharge side of the relief valve and the inlet to the relief valve. There should be a difference in the temperatures of the two lines if there is not leakage. If the temperatures are the same, it is likely that the relief valve is leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Lightly touching a piece of equipment with fingertips can give a subjective evaluation of how smooth a piece of equipment is running. With practice, it is a reasonably good method of detecting vibration. It must be done regularly as that is the only way to note the changes from yesterday or last week.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		If belts were loose, it may be possible to detect it not only by the sound but also by the smell of the rubber being removed from the side of the belts. Burned oil has a distinct scent that can indicate a potential problem. Paint that gets hot enough to discolor gives a distinctive odor. Each scent may indicate a particular problem with the equipment. Other problems can be indicated if the product being processed in the plant gives a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; odor and when there is a problem it gives a distinctly different odor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The advantages of these types of inspections are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Always available&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Inexpensive&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Can be done by anyone&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The disadvantages to these techniques are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Subjective&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to communicate to work request or someone else&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to repeat&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Problems cannot be detected at their earliest stages of inception&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tools available to improve detection or quantify what your senses detect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasonic gun: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a relatively inexpensive device for listening to noises in the ultrasonic range. It is sometimes used in leak detection and sometimes when listening to bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Stethoscope:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an inexpensive tool that can pick up every sound that the equipment is making. It must be used regularly or it is impossible to determine if there is a problem or not. The good news is that it picks up everything, and the bad news is that it picks up everything.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Screwdriver: &lt;/strong&gt;A steel or aluminum rod can be used to touch the piece of equipment where the suspected noise is and the other end touched to the ear to listen for unusual noises. The end touching the ear should be padded and the other end kept away from rotating shafts.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Valve wrench:&lt;/strong&gt; A valve wrench can be used in the same way as the other techniques to get the sound of what is happening inside a piece of rotating equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Hard hat:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a hard hat can be turned on edge and touched to the equipment and the other end touched to the ear to listen for potential problems inside the rotating piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR gun:&lt;/strong&gt; The infrared handheld non-contact temperature-measuring device is an easy tool use if it is used within its limitations. The limitations are: Many IR guns use a laser pointer to tell where you are aiming the device. The area the device looks at is cone-shaped and the laser is at the center of the cone (Figure 17). That means the further away from the item of interest you are, the more surface area will be averaged into the reading. The laser spot does not represent the measurement area of the device. The first surface that the device sees is the one that will be measured. You can&amp;rsquo;t measure the temperature of something behind a glass or plastic cover, as that cover will be what is measured. If correct temperatures are important, the device must be used on flat, dark-colored objects. It will give very low readings on shiny objects. The best use of the device is to mark a black paint spot on the areas of interest and use the infrared gun, as close as possible at that spot. It is the only way to get useful repeatable readings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR camera: &lt;/strong&gt;These devices are similar to the handheld guns, but are like looking through a camera. The objects look gray, with a color scale range showing different temperatures. What appears to have no problem with the naked eye will show very differently with the infrared camera. Typical pictures of what the eye can see and what the infrared camera can see are illustrated in figure 18.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Strobe light&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 19): This device has a high-intensity light that can be controlled to a specific flash rate. When an object is turning at a specific speed and the strobe flash rate is tuned to the same flash rate, the moving object appears to be stopped. A good visual inspection can be done while a piece of equipment is turning at running speed. Things like broken shim packs in couplings, missing keys or broken fans on electric motors can all be inspected without having to stop the piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Vibration equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A handheld vibration meter can be used to get overall readings. The use of equipment to augment the five senses is useful because it is objective and not subjective. Everyone that uses the equipment and measures in the same place will get the same number. If 50 people touch the same piece of equipment in the same place, there is likely to be 50 different interpretations of how much vibration there is. This is also true for how hot a piece of equipment is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If quantitative analysis is required, a contact parameter is an inexpensive and accurate tool for temperatures. It is simple to use and will give repeatable results no matter what color the surface being measured is.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GUIDES FOR OPERATORS TO INSPECT EQUIPMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These types of inspections can be generated for all types of equipment, such as fans, compressors, extruders, turbines, motors, conveyers, elevators, etc. This list is limited to centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, gearboxes, motors, heat exchanger and turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;PUMP INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le-Bleu_oil.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the pump as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the pump that have come loose?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the motor amps. Pump capacity problems do not cause the motor to pull excessive amps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the seal leaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there proper level in the seal pot if used?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the discharge pressure gauge steady? (If not, there may be cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

			Is paint burned off in new places? Why? (Paint discolors around 400 to 450 degrees F / 200 to 230 degrees C)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at vibration levels on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the pump.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday? Is the noise the motor or the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing? (It may be a control valve opening and closing.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound like gravel inside of the pump casing? (Cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If used, are the drive belts squealing? Are belts loose?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the pump with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it warm, hot, cold?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it shaking too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary oil pump running if it has one? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil relief valve dumping oil? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the pump vibrating? Is it the same as yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the bearing housing hot? (It may be too much oil or bad cooler.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch the seal lines; is there a difference in temperature indicating flow?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;MOTOR INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; (mechanical)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the motor as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it smoking or sparks flying?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there anything loose, shaking or vibrating on the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the flex conduit in good condition or broken?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Has the dust cap come off of the bearing on the coupling end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan on the TEFC motor turning?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the air filters or fins on a TEFC motor clear so air can circulate?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there any paint burned on the motor? If yes, why and where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Bearings? Fan?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise the motor or the driven piece of equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or a rhythmic hum?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the belts slipping on the drive end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it vibrating?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan turning and putting out air?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the cooling system for the motor and/or lubrication system functioning correctly?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GEARBOX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the gearbox as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the gearbox that have come loose? (Coolers, bearing caps, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is an oil cooler, is heat being exchanged? Touch the inlet and outlines to insure heat is being removed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the turbine as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

			Is steam leaking out of the glands that seal the shaft to the casing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil level correct in the sump? In the bearing boxes?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

			Is the delta P for the oil filter high? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check the vibration readings if continuously monitored.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at piping support springs to ensure that blocks were not left in after maintenance, especially if a hydro was performed on the piping system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the coupling area and see if there are shims from the spacer or dust if an elastometric type of coupling is used.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the turbine.&lt;/p&gt;

			Is the noise constant or changing? Is the governor steady or hunting?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the turbine?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the turbine bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;

			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check oil cooler to ensure it is removing heat from the oil.&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;HEAT EXCHANGER INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the heat exchanger as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the differential pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is heat being exchanged in the cooler? Touch the inlet and outlet and insure there is a difference in temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the delta T for the exchanger normal?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the exchanger&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there the sound of gas or boiling going on inside?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the exchanger your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch or test the inlets and outlets of the exchanger to see if an exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment start-up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check and start all auxiliary system. That would include lubrication, seal, and cooling systems as they apply.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure there are adequate liquid levels in all areas that have liquids&amp;nbsp;; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers and barrier or buffer systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated prior to starting.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for warm up to allow all parts to come to temperature. A rule of thumb is to allow the pump temperature to rise at 100 degrees per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the pump uses a double seal or other arrangement that has a cooler, ensure that the cooler is functioning by touching the inlet and outlet parts to ensure that heat exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is a device such as a guided slide or flex plate as on steam turbines, it must be free to allow movement or flexing as temperatures rise from ambient. The same is true for extreme cold temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			On motors, ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that the area around the equipment is clean and free of hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Ensure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that all valves are in the proper position.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Start the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform operational checks after startup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment shutdown:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for cool down to allow all parts to come to temperature and oil left circulating long enough to ensure the bearings will not be damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant prior to shutdown while it is still circulating. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that there are adequate lubricant levels in all areas that have lubricant; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the auxiliary systems, again to include lubrication, seal systems and cooling. If rotors are extremely hot (above 250 F / 120 C), allow the lubricating system to circulate to cool the shaft and bearings. This is especially necessary if the bearings are made of babbited material.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the equipment has a cooler to regulate temperatures, it is ideal to have a method of back-flushing the cooler. This should be done at each opportunity such as shutdown or equipment swaps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow. If they are obstructed, see that they are cleared before the next use. If the motor has filters, look at the condition of the filters and have them changed if they are dirty before the next start.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Insure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform a visual inspection for leaks after shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		While appearing elemental, the list of inspection items, explanation of equipment, and important relationships is essential to good equipment operation and longevity. It is not unusual for people to accomplish these tasks away from work but are not always practiced at work as an operator. The simple techniques of touching, listening and visually inspecting equipment while on rounds or passing by equipment will ensure the best life possible for equipment and reduce the likelihood of unexpected failures.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How to prevent electrical damage to rolling element bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Electrical damage to rolling element bearings is a common cause of failure &amp;ndash; common enough to have a whole category listed under the ISO standard for Bearing Damage (ISO 15243:2004, from &lt;a href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2d15767163007a761670&amp;amp;ls=fded1275716d0d7976157571&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe9615787562027d71&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t=" title="www.iso.org"&gt;www.iso.org&lt;/a&gt;.) It&amp;#39;s technically called electrical erosion. So, where does the damage come from, and what can you do to prevent it from happening in your machines?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are basically four cases to consider: Is the machine moving or not; and are you getting current leakage, or a high amperage discharge through the bearings?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Electrical current passage through bearings can happen when machines are not moving. Example: Your friendly contractor does some welding at your plant and decides to attach her ground via your nearby electric motor. This would be a high amperage discharge, and might &amp;quot;weld&amp;quot; bearing parts together internally. Low-intensity current would likely produce many tiny craters that aggregate into darker areas of damage. If you have burnt-smelling lubricant as well, it&amp;#39;s another confirmation of current leakage. This leakage might be from static discharge (are you making plastic or paper products?) or from high-voltage current spikes caused by variable frequency drive (VFD) converters.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When the machine is moving, the current passage often produces a very regular pattern of fine, dark lines across the bearing raceway. These can grow in size and depth as the damage continues. If you don&amp;#39;t have vibration monitoring, eventually an operator will hear it, hopefully before something catastrophic happens.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What can be done to eliminate these unwanted currents? If you suspect static discharge, inspect your grounding: straps get corroded or come loose. If you suspect VFD&amp;#39;s as the source, have an expert look at your cabling, especially cable quality, lengths and termination.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Some motors and generator sets simply produce stray currents that can&amp;#39;t be eliminated. In these cases, change to a bearing with Insulation (SKF Insocoat, for example) or a bearing with ceramic rolling elements to allow the current to go safely to ground. Whatever you&amp;#39;d pay for these parts is a small cost considering the price of your downtime.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Timken introduces solutions for sustainable wind power</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Leveraging organic investments sustained during the recession to expand both its wind power offering and capacity domestically and internationally, The Timken Company this week introduced what is for the company a record number of new product developments for the industry at the 2010 Windpower Conference and Exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken, the 110-year-old market leader in proprietary alloy steel and power transmission components and systems, is the only company serving the wind-energy industry with engineering and manufacturing in both competencies critical to the sustainable performance of wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken also retooled and expanded facilities in Asheboro, N.C., and Tyger River, S.C., to serve its customers, in addition to existing wind bearing production in Wuxi, China; Chennai, India; and Ploiesti, Romania. This week, the company began shipping its initial production from a new plant in Xiangtan, China. Timken also provides clean steel from its facilities in Canton, Ohio, for its own production and various wind-energy components for other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now working with the world&amp;#39;s leading wind turbine manufacturers at varying stages of development, Timken has established a supply chain that is unrivaled in the breadth of manufacturing and service locations around the world dedicated to serve the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;From engineering investment, to our manufacturing and service capabilities in every part of the world, Timken is in the best position to deliver exceptional value and lifecycle support to customers who are developing the next generation multi-megawatt-class turbines,&amp;quot; said Christopher Coughlin, president of Timken&amp;#39;s Process Industries Segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among technology innovations Timken is highlighting at the 2010 Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition in Dallas are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New Timken Wear-Resistant Bearings, Cylindrical or Spherical: This breakthrough bearing technology extends predicted life up to three times longer than standard cylindrical or spherical bearings. With up to 15 percent less torque, Timken&amp;#39;s wear-resistant bearings resist damages such as smearing, scuffing, false brinelling and micropitting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The new UltraWind Tapered Roller Bearing from Timken has the highest life ratings in the industry, as certified by Germanischer Lloyd. This main-shaft, ultra large-bore bearing has a simplified drivetrain design that saves capital-equipment costs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timken&amp;#39;s new Wind Energy Lubrication System enhances optimal wind power production by precisely and evenly directing fresh grease to bearing inlets while actively purging old lubricant with a centralized lubrication-delivery device that works with either series-progressive or injector-based lubricant delivery methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Three new Wind Seals from Timken including the EcoTurn Labyrinth Seal, a non-contacting design that prevents grease migration and contaminants, ideally suited for Timken&amp;#39;s low-pressure lubrication system. The Elastomer Wind Seal is engineered with a flexible sealing lip to handle bearing deflections and minimize friction and cone wear; while the PTFE Wind Energy Seal offers excellent chemical inertness and low friction to help maximize performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timken&amp;#39;s new Middle Frequency Induction Heater is designed to provide a simple and safe approach to assembly and disassembly of large bearings for wind energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timken&amp;#39;s Planet Pac and Integrated Flexpin Bearings provide power dense solutions designed to increase performance and reliability of gearboxes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clean Timken Steel provides superior strength and durable performance for bearings and gears.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timken&amp;#39;s Online Intelligence System offers a unique condition-monitoring system designed specifically to improve uptime for low-speed powertrains.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timken&amp;#39;s proprietary Syber Advanced Wind System Analysis engineering platform reduces development time and costs while optimizing main shaft and gearbox systems for sustainable performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Fish processor saves with switch to Molded-Oil bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	NSK&amp;rsquo;s cost-reduction program has achieved a major success with a customer in the food processing industry, achieving annual cost savings of &amp;euro;437.839 per year on a battered fish processing line as a result of replacing bearing inserts with NSK&amp;rsquo;s innovative Molded-Oil bearings.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The bearing problem on the fish processing line centered on a conveyor which is used in the process of adding batter to fish products. The harsh nature of the process meant that the 25-millimeter-in-diameter bearings on the conveyor were lasting just four weeks on the line due to the ingress of contaminants and frequent washdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/nsk101.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Engineers from NSK&amp;rsquo;s AIP cost-reduction program were called in to give advice. The AIP cost-reduction program is a value-added service that helps bearing users to improve reliability, reduce operating costs, and improve efficiency and profitability. These objectives are achieved by delivering tangible savings to assets, such as equipment and machinery, and also by improving the working knowledge of maintenance and engineering personnel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NSK engineers visited the process and identified the problem. They suggested a solution using NSK&amp;rsquo;s Molded-Oil Bearings, which they were certain would prolong bearing life.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Molded-Oil bearings employ a special solid lubricant to positively transform the performance of machinery in environments exposed to high humidity, corrosion and contamination. The bearings achieve improvements in performance and reliability by offering more than twice the operating life of grease lubrication in water-contaminated environments. The solid lubricant technology also means that operating environments are kept free of grease; and there is no need for refilling of lubricant, as Molded-Oil provides a continuous supply of lubricating oil.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Sample Molded-Oil bearing inserts were fitted to the conveyor and trailed over an extended period of six months. Impressed with the dramatically extended bearing life, the customer began replacement of the existing conveyor bearings with Molded-Oil units. In addition to providing improved life, these bearings are also saving the customer the considerable cost of regreasing of bearings, estimated at &amp;euro;4.680 per annum.

            <title>Did the GM bailout really save American jobs?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Wilfried Porth, member of the board of management at Daimler AG, cautions against the assumption that the General Motors&amp;nbsp;bailout saved American jobs. He warns legislators against subsidizing the auto industry to the same extent as of the commercial airline industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.K. steelworkers finds solution, savings in bearing redesign</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The combination of NSK&amp;rsquo;s experience of providing solutions to the global steel industry, and the company&amp;rsquo;s industry-wide cost saving program, is providing savings of &amp;euro;372.558 per annum in reduced maintenance costs on a annealing process line accumulator sheave at a major steelworks in the United Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The continuous annealing process line was experiencing unplanned downtime of around 17 hours per year, on average, at a cost of &amp;euro;21.915 per hour, or &amp;euro;372.558 per annum. The stoppages also meant that heavy lifting gear had to be hired, and additional maintenance personnel employed for the duration of the downtime periods.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NSK has worked with leading global steel makers to develop a package of high-performance bearings that address downtime problems in all areas of steelmaking. This experience was decisive in the company being asked to visit the steelworks, determine the problem on the annealing process line accumulator sheave, and then come up with a solution.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	After analyzing failed bearings on the annealing process line, NSK redesigned the assembly to accommodate a more robust bearing arrangement using crane sheave bearings. As the name implies, crane sheave bearings are usually employed in crane sheaves, in quarries, ports and building sites. However, the high load capacity and advanced levels of sealing provided by these bearings means that they also ideal for applications in the demanding conditions prevailing in steel making environments.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	An initial trial of the crane sheave bearings was undertaken on the annealing process line to determine the effectiveness of NSK&amp;rsquo;s solution. The new bearings performed successfully providing a maintenance-free operating life which was over 3-times longer than that of the original bearings. On the basis of this performance, NSK has calculated an operating life of at least five years for the bearings.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We knew from previous steel industry experience that crane sheave bearings would deliver the optimum solution in this application,&amp;rdquo; said an NSK spokesman. &amp;ldquo;They are essentially full complement cylindrical roller bearings offering an advanced sealing system that minimizes grease leakage and increases resistance to the entry of water and other foreign substances. Their ability to provide reliable life in arduous environments is enhanced by machined holes, which are provided on the inner and outer rings of the bearings to allow grease replenishment, even while the bearing is in place. In addition, the bearings are supplied with phosphate surface treatment to improve their resistance to corrosion.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/6vB_MAK-njA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bearing substitution saves big money for petrochemical refinery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	NSK&amp;rsquo;s experience of the petrochemical industry was pivotal&amp;nbsp;in solving a recurring bearing problem, which was resulting in unacceptable downtime at a refinery in the United Kingdom. The problem concerned a centrifugal pump that was critical to the refinery operation. The pump was failing on average three times a year; and with breakdown costs running at &amp;euro;1.500 per hour, this was resulting in losses of &amp;euro;27.870 per year.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The problem with the centrifugal pump centered on a cylindrical roller bearing, which was failing inexplicably following the transition from belt drive to direct drive on the pump &amp;ndash; a modification undertaken to simplify the drive train and improve the overall efficiency of the pump drive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Faced with this continuing problem, the refinery operator called in NSK to provide a solution. NSK has a wealth of experience, globally, both of the petrochemical industry in general and of centrifugal pumps in particular; the company has introduced many new bearing products which provide improved efficiency, reliability and life in centrifugal pump operations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This experience was deployed in an investigation of the operating parameters of the pump; in particular to ascertain the reason why the problem began after the change from belt drive to direct drive. NSK engineers studied the inner raceways of the failed cylindrical roller bearings and also calculated the radial loads that were exerted on the bearings under both forms of drive: belt and direct drive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What they concluded was that the change from belt to direct drive had drastically reduced the radial load on the cylindrical roller bearing. This reduction in applied load was causing the bearing rollers to skid on the bearing&amp;rsquo;s inner raceway, resulting in progressive damage that eventually caused the bearings to fail prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The solution proposed by NSK was a simple one: replace the cylindrical ball bearing with a lower friction deep groove ball bearing. This solution was adopted by the refinery, and has proved to be totally successful, with not a single failure since the bearing substitution was implemented&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/j7O7NuxVUh0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Manufacturer creates smallest mounted ball bearing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ball bearings are crucial components in many types of medical devices, from blood analyzers and infusion pumps to dialysis equipment and aspirators. However, until now, precision-mounted ball bearings have been available with shaft diameters no smaller than one-half inch, making them unsuitable for medical equipment designed to meet space constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To accommodate the needs of shrinking equipment platforms, Spyraflo Inc., an inventor and manufacturer of self-clinching and self-aligning bearing technology, is meeting the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;What makes our product unique,&amp;rdquo; says chief operating officer Peter Allen, &amp;ldquo;is the fact that nobody else supplies mounted miniature bearings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Miniature ball bearings place special demands on bearing assemblies, Allen says. &amp;ldquo;At that size, the nature of the inner and outer race and the balls becomes very critical, partly because of the relationship between the diameter of the shaft and the speed at which you wish to rotate it.&amp;rdquo; Thus, as bearings decrease in size, the assembly into which they are pressed requires a bearing mounting hole or device with ever-greater precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;To install miniature bearings, designers in the past had to either produce some form of bearing mount, including a precision bearing-locating hole, or accurately machine a precision locating hole in the machine panel. Expensive machining had to be carried out before the bearings could be installed,&amp;rdquo; Allen says. &amp;ldquo;So we eliminated the need for design engineers to be concerned about precision machining and the installation of the bearing. Now we have a preassembled housing that consists of a straightforward two-bolt hole mount.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spyraflo&amp;rsquo;s mount consists of Annular Bearing Engineers Committee (ABEC) 3 Japanese-manufactured stainless-steel ball bearings with shaft diameters ranging in size from one-eighth to three-eighth inch. The assembly&amp;rsquo;s aluminum body and stainless-steel bearing combination result in corrosion resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The design consists of an aluminum pillow block with a precision hole in the center that is produced with a tolerance of approximately 0.0002 inch, according to Allen. Then, the bearing is positioned inside the mount, resulting in precise dimensions from the base to the central line of the bearing. If the mounting hole is too large, the bearing falls out, and if it is too small, the bearing seizes up, causing the assembly to run hot at very high shaft speeds. &amp;ldquo;Thus, the diameter of the hole into which the bearing is placed is critical,&amp;rdquo; Allen insists. &amp;ldquo;And we&amp;rsquo;ve taken that concern away from the designer.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/zWDwq3GJ_cA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dodge bearings help Roseburg Forest Products leave competition in the dust</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Roseburg Forest Products of Roseburg, Ore., is one of the largest privately held forest products companies in the United States. Established in 1936, today the company owns nearly 800,000 acres of forestlands and produces a diverse line of quality wood products, including lumber, engineered wood products, specialty panels, and plywood. Three of the company&amp;rsquo;s plywood plants produce over a billion square feet of plywood, industrial panels, and sheathing annually, and the manufacturing facility in Dillard, Ore., is the single-largest integrated wood product manufacturing facility in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it should come as no surprise that in facilities this large and complex, the team responsible for keeping production up and maintenance costs down is eager to find products that will not only perform and last but are also easy to install and maintain. Three years ago, this team&amp;rsquo;s search for a better bearing solution led them to two Dodge bearings that offered everything they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low Maintenance Seals the Deal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Chuck Drew, the lead millwright at the No. 2 mill in Dillard, explains that Roseburg wanted to find a spherical roller bearing that would require little maintenance but would also be tough enough to handle the hanging load and the high temperatures on their dryer application. Their goal was to dramatically reduce the amount of time it was taking them to maintain the split housing bearings they were currently running on their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;About every six months we would have to lift off the top cap to hand wash the bearings, check to make sure the spanners, washers and adapters were all in good shape, wipe out all the old grease, and then repack them,&amp;rdquo; says Drew. &amp;ldquo;We would no sooner get them all done on the maintenance schedule then we would have to turn around and start back in on them again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the maintenance team saw the Dodge IMPERIAL bearing for the first time, Drew says the product&amp;rsquo;s advantages were obvious. &amp;ldquo;With these IMPERIALS, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything but re-grease them, which is so quick and easy because of the sealing system that allows you to purge the old grease without fear of blowing out the seals,&amp;rdquo; says Drew. &amp;ldquo;Not only that, but these bearings can handle the application. The IMPERIAL bearings have been running for more than three years, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t lost one yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on that success, there was no question about which bearings would be used when a new dryer was installed at a nearby facility in January 2006. Jay Osborne, lead millwright at the No. 1 mill in Dillard, says the only choice was IMPERIAL. &amp;ldquo;We like the bearings because they are easy to tighten up, we get a good solid grip, they are easy to maintain, and they are easy to change out,&amp;rdquo; says Osborne. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just a good product.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mills Get a GRIP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on their experience with the IMPERIAL bearing, both Drew and Osborne were eager to see the Dodge GRIP TIGHT adapter ball bearing when it was introduced a few years ago. They were intrigued by the concept of the pull/push adapter system, a fully concentric 360 degree inner ring, with a tapered fi t through the length of the bore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About two years ago, they began experimenting with the bearings, putting them on a variety of applications to see how they would work. Both claim that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before it became clear how well the bearings would perform in their applications, especially compared to the set screw style bearings the mills had used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter what brand of bearing we used, the set screw style would always come lose on our high speed applications,&amp;rdquo; explains Drew. &amp;ldquo;But once we saw the GRIP TIGHT and the way the adapter attaches itself to the shaft for full contact, we could clearly see that this bearing works great.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t simply the GRIP TIGHT bearing&amp;rsquo;s performance that Drew and Osborne found impressive, it was also the ease with which the bearing could be installed and removed without causing any damage to the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Set screw bearings cause fretting corrosion, and sometimes they seize on the shaft,&amp;rdquo; said Drew. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve had to take a 12-pound sledge hammer &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding &amp;ndash; to beat on the bearing to get it off the shaft. But with GRIP TIGHT, we don&amp;rsquo;t have those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Osborn agrees that ease-of-use is a big plus. &amp;ldquo;The problem that we&amp;rsquo;ve had with the competitors&amp;rsquo; bearings is that when they failed, the shaft was usually destroyed,&amp;rdquo; says Osborne. &amp;ldquo;We would have to pull the roll out, weld it up, and have it machined before going back in, causing a lot of downtime and increased maintenance costs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good News Travels Fast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before the news about the two bearings reached the company&amp;rsquo;s plywood mill in Riddle, Ore. While the lead millwright at this facility, Chuck Bickel, believed what he heard, he wanted to see for himself before making a total commitment to the products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To test its performance firsthand, Bickel installed one GRIP TIGHT bearing on what he considers to be the toughest application in the mill, the number one unit of the pinch roller on the plywood sander. &amp;ldquo;I chose this spot because this is where the bearing is going to get hit the hardest by the panels of plywood that are coming through,&amp;rdquo; says Bickel. &amp;ldquo;It only took a month before we realized that this was the bearing that was going to work for us. It ended up being the right decision, because the bearing that we installed as a test almost two years ago is still there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even on less demanding applications, when set screw bearings didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily fail, Bickel came to realize that the ease of installation and removal inherent in the GRIP TIGHT bearings made them a superior solution, explaining that there are many applications in the mill where it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to take the bearings on and off so changes can be made on the equipment. For example, if the tip of a saw blade on the detail saw breaks, the bearings need to come off the shaft so the blades can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the past, we would have to fight to get the bearings off the shaft, causing a lot of damage,&amp;rdquo; says Bickel. &amp;ldquo;The time it took to make the change and repair the damage was adding up fast, but the GRIP TIGHT bearings are so easy to put on and take off &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s really a no-brainer choosing this product.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Impressed as he was by the GRIP TIGHT bearings&amp;rsquo; performance, Bickel installed IMPERIAL bearings on the contact rolls in the same sander application where he tested the GRIP TIGHT product, replacing a competitor&amp;rsquo;s bearings, which were failing more often than they should. And like the GRIP TIGHT, the IMPERIAL bearings are performing up to standards, plus Bickel says they are easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;These bearings have a great sealing system, which is key to a bearing lasting longer&amp;rdquo; says Bickel. &amp;ldquo;We have wasted a lot of time and money on failed bearings in the past, but no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Savings Add Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Drew takes pride in the fact that he was the first to discover the products that have helped save his company money. &amp;ldquo;I think our facilities were the first in the company to get started with these bearings, and now all the plants are following,&amp;rdquo; says Drew. &amp;ldquo;The other facilities have looked at us and have seen how well they work and now they are making the switch. We&amp;rsquo;ve been able to prove that we are saving money with these bearings because we have less maintenance and less downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for Bickel at the mill in Riddle, he too has become a believer in the products, saying that as bearings fail throughout his plant, they are being replaced with GRIP TIGHT and IMPERIAL bearings. &amp;ldquo;These products last longer, are easier to maintain, and are easy to get on and off the shaft,&amp;rdquo; claims Bickel. &amp;ldquo;The bottom line is that they are saving us valuable time and helping us to keep the plant running smoothly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Bickel, making the switch to Dodge bearings on the sander application alone has generated tremendous savings for the mill over the past two years. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve done the cost analysis ourselves, and I can tell you that we save money with the Dodge bearings, so why would we choose anything else?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/yVTCwIO_o9Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Azima DLI unveils enhanced machinery condition assessment software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, a leader and provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on April 5 announced a significant upgrade to its advanced machinery condition assessment software, ExpertALERT 3.40. Manufacturers now have the ability to improve plant performance by better prioritizing machine repairs while remaining focused on reliability and uptime priorities based on the ability to more rapidly collect and process data, and access accurate results through the Azima DLI WATCHMAN Reliability Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s automated solution provides plant managers with actionable, easy-to-understand fault diagnosis, fault severity and repair priority data for each machine they measure. ExpertALERT is an ideal solution for manufactures with significant workforce and budget restrictions because it provides timely information that is crucial to not only identifying critical machinery faults before they happen, but also for avoiding unnecessary maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ExpertALERT 3.40 includes a wide array of productivity and performance features including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Fifty percent faster data collection for DCX and DCA-60 data collectors: &lt;/strong&gt;The DCX and DCA-60 data collection has been optimized with the data collection time reduced from 37 seconds to only 19 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New User Defined Point Capabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;User-defined points (UDPs) may now be defined at the plant or area levels of the database hierarchy. UDPs allow external files of any type to be embedded in the ALERT database and referenced from the application software. By allowing UDPs at the plant or area level, reports covering groups of machines now have a home in the database tree. UDPs are now replicated between master and subscriber databases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Improved Accuracy of Bearing Fault Frequencies: &lt;/strong&gt;A new Bearing Database Update Tool lets users update the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; bearings in an ExpertALERT database without affecting new bearings that have been entered. This update improves the accuracy of the fault frequencies of the bearings included with ExpertALERT.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Windows 7 Support: &lt;/strong&gt;ExpertALERT now supports the Windows 7 Operating System.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New &amp;ldquo;Quick Review&amp;rdquo; of expert system automated analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;Results that have not been reviewed can now be automatically screened based on severity level by selecting this option from the Expert menu.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New Support for Single-Axis Sensors: &lt;/strong&gt;A new data collector option lets users change to single-axis mode to collect data in all three directions at a bearing with a single-axis sensor connected to Channel 1. When data collection is started, the system prompts the user to connect the sensor for each axis in turn and store the data appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ability to override sensitivity settings for triaxial accelerometers: &lt;/strong&gt;A new data collector option lets users specify sensitivity settings for all three axes of the accelerometer and override the single sensitivity setting specified in the database for this particular sensor location. This allows for more accurate data collection based on the actual calibration of the triaxial sensor. When this option is selected, additional fields appear so maintenance professionals can enter the model and serial number of the sensor and the sensitivity necessary (in mV/G) for each of the three channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s services and solutions are aimed at plants that recognize the direct correlation between ROI and performance,&amp;rdquo; said Jonathan Hakim, president, Azima DLI. &amp;ldquo;The urgency to cut operational costs has left many manufacturing companies with significant challenges in maintaining the performance of their condition monitoring program. The ExpertALERT solution provides companies with critical machinery health information that helps ensure optimal machinery performance and uptime while boosting employee productivity.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/ZfEk9O9Suow" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Pullers facilitate dismounting of bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF TMBS E strong back pullers facilitate dismounting of bearings in applications where the use of traditional jaw pullers is restricted due to lack of space or where the application demands a long reach. TMBS 100E and the TMBS 150E are equipped with a hydraulic spindle, which allows for effortless application of force up to 100 kN (11.2 ton US). The TMBS 50E is equipped with a mechanical spindle for force generation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Process for identifying the true source of bearing failure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Failure2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom: &lt;/strong&gt;A cement plant has eight overhung fans running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The fan shafts are supported by spherical roller bearings in split pillow block housings. The fans have been in service for more than 15 years, and share a common support platform. Within the last year, the bearing failure rate has been accelerating rapidly, and replacements are now occurring monthly. Operators have noted a marked increase in vibration in the area over the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Investigation: &lt;/strong&gt;The failed bearings show two sets of symptoms: failed bearings from two of the fans show excessive polish wear on their outside diameters, and evidence of a 360 degree load zone on the outer ring raceway. The other fans show bearing failure with greyish, washboard wear in a 120 degree load zone at the bottom of the outer ring. What&amp;#39;s happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/Failure.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer: &lt;/strong&gt;If you guessed the bearing rings were spinning in the housing due to imbalance, you&amp;#39;re halfway there: But what&amp;#39;s driving this behavior? There are several possible root causes, such as wear of fan wheels, shrouds, missing components (half-keys, for example) or simply improper initial balancing. Excessive imbalance can induce outer ring creep, which is why the high polish in the OD surfaces was observed. The 360 load zone is also from the imbalance. Find and correct the imbalance: did anything happen a year ago (process change, maintenance or operations personnel change, etc.) that might be contributory? After startup, measure vibration signatures to comply with local or ISO standards to verify the imbalance has been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about the other bearings? These are showing signs of secondary damage. High vibration from the two bad machines is transmitted to the other fans sharing the support. Mix this ambient vibration with a bit of cement dust and you have a perfect recipe for &amp;quot;washboard&amp;quot; abrasive wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Moral: &lt;/strong&gt;Examining failed bearings inside and out is a key best practice for uncovering root causes of failure. But we must also learn to couple the postmortem with a sound knowledge of machine history, operating conditions, and current diagnostic and performance data to get a complete picture of the failure cause. Otherwise, we risk an incomplete conclusion, which could lead to the application of improper (and often ineffective) corrective actions. Another key practice is to verify the effectiveness of the corrective action. Did our change work? Using a minimum of two condition monitoring measurements (vibration, temperature, oil analysis, etc.) to verify results is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the bearing failure terms discussed above are unfamiliar, get smart: SKF provides training in bearing failure analysis several times a year, nationwide, or at your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/T4JEsG6yPho" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title> How to remove a bearing for repair </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Before a bearing is sent out for service, it first must be removed from its shaft housing. It is important to use great care during the removal process to ensure that the bearing, shaft and housing are not damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bearing removal is best accomplished by using a bearing puller for standard outer and inner rings, which is available through many manufacturers. When removing bearings that have a backing shoulder that extends beyond the cone large rib, a puller that pulls through the rollers should be used. Hydraulic pressure is another available method to remove bearings. Pullers or wedges may be used to remove the bearing after the hydraulic pressure has expanded the race. Hot oil or heat may be used along with the pullers or wedges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken101.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the puller has been placed on the bearing and pressure is applied, the bearing race should expand and be easily removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Always use extreme caution when working with hot oil or steam. Contact with hot oil or other heat sources can result in serious bodily harm. Protective clothing and safety glasses should be worn at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of valid methods you may use to remove a bearing from its shaft. No matter which method is used, be careful not to expose any surface of the bearing to the flame of a torch. Any torch-heat damage renders the bearing as scrap. A bearing&amp;rsquo;s hardness and metallurgical structure is dramatically altered by torch heat. When it is necessary to drive out inner or outer rings, take extreme care to prevent bearing seat damage, backing shoulder damage or burrs on any surface. Damage to these surfaces will prevent proper seating of the bearing and its new components when reassembled in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Failure to observe the following warnings could lead to a risk of serious bodily harm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper maintenance and handling practices are critical. Follow the equipment manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s installation instructions. Failure to follow installation instructions and to maintain proper lubrication can result in equipment failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Never spin a bearing with compressed air. The components may be forcefully expelled.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Consistency plays critical role in Ash Grove reliability program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Broken equipment is a cement producer&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy, causing lost time, productivity and money. While many of these problems can be avoided through an effective predictive maintenance (PdM) program, operators are often hesitant to implement one due to the up-front and ongoing investment required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Ken Rone, vice president of manufacturing services at Ash Grove Cement, a PdM investment is well worth the costs, paying for itself every time equipment failure and downtime is avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building the foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Overland Park, Kan., Ash Grove Cement has nearly 9 million tons of cement capacity and is considered a leader in the U.S. cement industry. The company was founded more than 125 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove first started its corporate Maintenance Excellence Process (MEP) in 2000, establishing standardized PdM equipment and procedures at each of its 10 U.S. plants. What varied was the staffing and consistency of data reporting. Some locations relied on onsite technical personnel while others used third-party consultants for various levels of vibration analysis, infrared thermography and oil analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had a high-level, sophisticated program, but we identified vibration analysis as a weak link where we lacked consistency,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to bring in an independent third party with expertise in this area and began evaluating potential partners in August 2008. We were ready to go with Timken in early 2009.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken is a technical solutions provider focused on improving uptime in industrial equipment. By applying its extensive knowledge of metallurgy, tribology, engineering and data analysis, Timken engineers help to maximize reliability and energy efficiency in machines critical to plant operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re at our best when we can bring all our knowledge together to solve a problem,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Brooks, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;When we combine optimal bearing, sealing and lubrication technology with things like proper maintenance, condition monitoring and diagnostic analysis, we really start seeing better results in how our customers&amp;rsquo; equipment performs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ohio-based company also offers in-depth training and consulting services, working with customers to develop a program that suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken was the right choice for us because of their consulting experience,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;Their evaluation devices also use the same technology platform as our existing PdM equipment, so we were already compatible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing a new baseline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One challenge Ash Grove had was consistently collecting baseline readings for vibration analysis levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s critical to establish baselines for trending purposes,&amp;rdquo; said Tod Cotter, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;Once the baselines are in place, you have something to compare future readings to &amp;ndash; if the amplitude of the readings trend upward, that&amp;rsquo;s when a problem might be occurring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing this, Ash Grove asked Timken&amp;rsquo;s reliability experts to establish baseline vibration analysis readings and provide consistent, verifiable data for Criticality 1 and Criticality 2 equipment at each plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cotter collected the data and performed analysis on all machines of 1,000 horsepower or more. He then made recommendations for changes in maintenance scheduling and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Based on our findings, we provided an audit of what was good and bad at each location,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;Each plant had different equipment and operating parameters, but the process helped us identify existing best practices that could be shared among all the facilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the Ash Grove plants in Leamington, Utah, and Seattle stood out as having solid vibration analysis programs managed by a combination of in-house technicians and outside contractors. Their effective processes were highlighted in Timken&amp;rsquo;s recommendations and later incorporated into operations at other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding the collaboration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Impressed with Timken&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise and suggestions, Rone asked the company if it would be willing to help manage predictive maintenance activities at four Ash Grove plants having issues with their existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our approach is to establish a collaboration, not just come in and dictate what a company should do,&amp;rdquo; said Brooks. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re glad to work with Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s people &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; to come up with a custom plan that helps them keep their critical assets running.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan is working. In the first 10 months alone, Timken and Ash Grove discovered 10 instances in which equipment critical to plant operations was starting to fail. These discoveries enabled maintenance personnel to make repairs and replace damaged components before a problem could cause unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Avoiding breakdowns in major equipment such as kilns, crushers and fans has the potential to save Ash Grove millions of dollars. One &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; on a raw mill motor at the Leamington plant helped the company avoid approximately $350,000 in downtime costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another case, Timken helped Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s plant in Foreman, Ark., avoid an estimated 12 hours of downtime by analyzing data that indicated a fault in a ball mill&amp;rsquo;s fan gearbox. Removal of the gearbox bearing, which showed severe pitting damage, confirmed a problem. Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s maintenance personnel replaced the gearbox before it led to a total system shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove also has made the switch to Timken&amp;rsquo;s machine evaluator for data collection. The machine evaluator is a handheld instrument that combines sophisticated vibration analysis with shock-pulse monitoring to detect bearing damage and inadequate lubrication, as well as many other problems with mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Shock-pulse works particularly well for monitoring conditions in slow-speed cement equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;The machine evaluator has advanced diagnosis capabilities for detecting machine faults such as imbalance, misalignment and structural weaknesses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove maintenance personnel and onsite technicians also are receiving training on how to use the machine evaluator and integrate it into a comprehensive PdM program. Additional training related to maintenance and reliability is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rone said training was a differentiating factor that helped Ash Grove select Timken, and Timken&amp;rsquo;s willingness to share its technical knowledge has translated into real business value. He also believes that the most successful PdM programs are consistent and ongoing. For example, part of Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s MEP strategy is to reconfirm its vibration analysis baselines annually, with the help of Timken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken has definitely helped us strengthen our PdM practices,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;With their onsite support and accurate data reporting, our own people have more confidence in their decision making. Right from the start, Timken demonstrated a level of technical know-how that is helping us achieve best-in-class results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing repair, PdM program address downtime at Gallatin Steel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When your rolling mill equipment has an emergency, calling a vendor is like calling the paramedics. Timken recently helped bring Gallatin Steel, a flat-rolled carbon steel producer in Ghent, Ky., back to life after a period of downtime. The Gallatin site avoided further costly downtime in its rolling mill operations as the result of an emergency bearing repair and the installation of a predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gallatin Steel employees heard an unusual noise coming from a shaft on a rolling mill stand that was critical to the mill&amp;rsquo;s productivity. With assistance from an on-site Timken representative, the noise was identified as a broken bearing cage, which was the result of high speed and impact force upon a competing brand&amp;rsquo;s two-row tapered bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. On the floor of the Gallatin Steel mill in Ghent, Ky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing, which had been in service since the plant opened 11 years ago, was removed and inspected. The cage was welded in the six places where it had fractured, and the gearbox was re-assembled. Timken also corrected the bearing clearance and made several other modifications to minimize any wear patterns that could occur after the assembly was mounted back in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help Gallatin avoid future emergency repairs, Timken installed a StatusCheck condition monitoring device on the bearing to measure overall vibration. StatusCheck, a wireless system designed to detect and monitor excessive levels of vibration and temperature, now alerts Gallatin&amp;rsquo;s pulpit operator to vibration changes, indicating potential problems in the mill drive train. The results can then be evaluated with Timken&amp;rsquo;s on-site technical team and further diagnostic testing may be required to understand the severity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken is an integral part of our overall preventive and predictive maintenance programs and has played a very valuable role in helping us identify potential problems before they actually became problems,&amp;rdquo; says Don Daily, president of Gallatin Steel.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Microbial screening systems help plants become financially fit</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Optimizing the fitness of a manufacturing facility requires a multi-faceted approach, using in combination the three levers of lowering operating expenses, increasing throughput and reducing inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies today have taken steps to manage expenses and inventory levels without negatively impacting customer service. Companies have hired consultants to reorganize their production areas in order to speed up the flow of goods by a few minutes here and there, or made significant investments in software to optimize production, resource and inventory allocations. Yet for many manufacturers, it is still possible to cut additional days out of their production cycle by implementing a high-throughput, rapid microbial screening system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Surprisingly, many of today&amp;rsquo;s modern, automated manufacturing facilities still test for microbiological contamination using a method dating back to the late 1800s. This traditional method relies on visual identification of microbial growth and averages five days for non-sterile and a minimum of 14 days for sterile products. During this wait time, raw materials, in-process batch or finished goods can be quarantined &amp;ndash; adding days to manufacturing lead times, tying up working capital and ultimately leaving the facility far from fiscally fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, current rapid microbial screening systems &amp;ndash; which are validated and accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &amp;ndash; enable manufacturers to accurately screen for the absence of microbial contamination in only 24 hours, ensuring product quality and trimming four days from the average production cycle. Similarly, rapid methods can also be used for sterility testing, providing results in seven days vs. 14 to 17 with traditional methods and cutting a week or more from production. The financial savings can be tremendous. For example, one major pharmaceutical company was waiting 14 days for results from an in-process sterility test. During this past year, they validated and switched to a microbial screening system that enables them to release batches within two days, saving 12 days from their production cycle time and reducing this in-process wait time by 85 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantifying the Value&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Manufacturers can accurately quantify the financial value of implementing a rapid microbial screening system. For example, a high-throughput rapid system can be purchased and installed for less than $100,000, achieve payback in six to nine months, and realize an average five-year net present value in excess of $500,000 for non-sterile testing and well upward of $1 million for sterility testing at a single plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Likewise, implementing a rapid system goes a long way toward boosting a facility&amp;rsquo;s overall fitness score, with a host of quantifiable benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Reduces working capital requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Rapid methods can decrease investment in product held in quarantined inventory at any given time. And since it takes fewer days to produce the same amount of product, the shortened cycle time also reduces safety stock requirements and its associated working capital investment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Improved operational efficiencies &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Shorter cycle times results in a leaner, more responsive manufacturing operation, which improves a company&amp;rsquo;s financial metrics, including return on invested capital and inventory turns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Improves recovery from contamination events &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Rapid detection means earlier detection of contamination when it does occur. This helps to minimize the amount of product affected, accelerate corrective action and get the facility back on track quickly. Also, risk of customer service interruptions or product recalls is minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Saves warehouse space &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;/em&gt;Do facility space requirements factor into your five-year planning horizon?How much physicalspace is required in your manufacturing and distribution facilities for in-process inventories and safety stock? Reduced inventories throughout your supply chain may decrease the need for outsourced warehousing, or defer the costs associated with facility expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Shortens the cash cycle &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; With rapid methods, finished goods are released to market faster, leading to an accelerated revenue cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Swift decision making &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Implementing a rapid screening system provides actionable information that allows product to move forward quickly. When contamination is detected, that batch can be isolated and attention focused on remediation and further process improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twice as nice in a crisis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;As great as it is to take days out of the production cycle, the benefits more than double if there is a contamination event. That&amp;rsquo;s because the sooner you know about a problem, the faster you can stop the line, get rid of the problem and produce (and test) a replacement batch. In the end, a quicker response time minimizes the overall economic impact of discarded or reprocessed goods and makes you more responsive to customers, saving you money and protecting your reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lieberman01.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time Like the Present&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re managing a fairly efficient operation, most companies today have room for improvement. The realizable cost savings and reduction in lead times and working capital requirements will enable your company to pursue more productive endeavors, like funding new projects, developing new products or even conserving cash. Take a close look at your current product release method to see if there is any time in micro-hold that can be reduced. That old method from the 1800s may be comfortable, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a thing for your figure(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/xmEyb7z3ehE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Publication explains factors for selecting bearings for gearboxes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The process of selecting bearings for all gearbox types is set to become more straightforward, structured and transparent with the launch of a new free publication, &amp;ldquo;Rolling Bearings for Industrial Gearboxes&amp;rdquo;, from NSK.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NSK supplies bearings for all aspects of gearbox operation, and the new publication reflects this in the breadth of subject matter, which is designed to help users understand all the key areas that must be considered when selecting particular bearing types for converting and translating motion.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Rolling Bearings for gearboxes extends to 31 pages and is divided into eight sections. Section one gives an overview of all current gear designs &amp;ndash; worm, hypoid bevel, epicyclics, spur and bevel types &amp;ndash; outlining their advantages and disadvantages. Section two then moves on to discuss the numerous factors that affect bearing performance in gearboxes; factors such as load, speed, friction, environment, shaft arrangements, lubrication, assembly space &amp;ndash; and many more. All of these are considered individually with guidance as to the relevant questions to ask regarding each specific factor.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Section three deals with bearing types and their characteristics; here the user is helped by simple-to-use graphics; the first listing bearing types, and their capabilities, as regards loads, speeds, misalignment, and lubrication medium. The second graphic extends this information with an easy-to-read table that gives at-a-glance reference for the suitability of specific bearing types for a given set of operating parameters.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The following sections, four and five, are the most technical of the publication. The former looks at bearing positions inside gearboxes; it considers support by fixed and floating bearings, adjusted bearing support and floating bearing support. Here again graphics are used for illustration; this time in the form of a two- page table that shows most types of bearing arrangements, provides comments on them, and gives fields of application.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Next is a section that considers bearing life; this includes details on NSK&amp;rsquo;s latest optimized methods and calculation procedures such as the ABLE-Forecaster (Advanced Bearing Life Equation) software, and STIFF, a program developed by NSK that considers important parameters such as deformation of shafts and housings, misalignment, displacement of the bearing itself (and adjacent bearings), as well as internal operating cycles.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The final three sections devote seven pages to materials, lubrication, the consequences of lack of it, and proper dimensioning of bearings. As regards materials, the publication highlights NSK&amp;rsquo;s development of ground-breaking Super TF steel. This material sets new benchmarks for reliable operation in contaminated operating conditions, or applications where high stress factors are encountered. The new material can be employed in a wide range of bearing types.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The penultimate lubrication section provides a useful calculation of the quantity of oil required for optimum bearing performance; it considers whether oil or grease is best; and concludes with a graphic table giving details of damage caused by lubrication problems.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Completing what is a very comprehensive, concise publication, the final section deals with Proper Dimensioning of bearings. It gives procedures for proper fit selection, and tables detailing fits for radial bearings with housings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken to outfit U.S. Army Apache helicopters</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company&amp;rsquo;s Aerospace and Defense business has received an order to provide an emergency supply of left-hand engine nose gearboxes for aftermarket use on the U.S. Army&amp;#39;s fleet of Apache Longbow helicopters. Timken is the only aftermarket manufacturer approved to supply all five gearboxes onboard the Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken produces the gearboxes for both original equipment and aftermarket use at its plant in Manchester, Conn. The left- and right-hand nose gearboxes transmit power from the engines to the main transmission, which powers the main rotor and all onboard systems. Timken also provides gearboxes for the Apache&amp;#39;s main transmission, intermediate and tail-rotor positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the gearboxes, Timken bearings are found on several other areas of the Apache, including GE Model T700 Engines, the Honeywell Model 36 Auxiliary Power Unit and in the Arrowhead infrared sensor system, which is used to ensure safe flight for varied climate conditions and support accurate target controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Apache is a mission-critical system, and on-time delivery of replacement parts is paramount to the military meeting its operations timelines and objectives,&amp;quot; said J. Ron Menning, president of Timken&amp;#39;s Aerospace and Defense business segment. &amp;quot;The Army needs a supplier to meet a delivery imperative, and has placed trust in Timken. We plan to exceed their expectations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken has been serving the aerospace industry for more than 70 years, providing precision-engineered components and assemblies for original-equipment and aftermarket customers. The company&amp;#39;s products span the lifecycle of aircraft, from turbine engine components, gears and transmissions to reconditioning services and an extensive, growing portfolio of FAA-approved replacement parts for a variety of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Timken Company&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Timken Company keeps the world turning with innovative friction management and power transmission products and services, enabling customers&amp;rsquo; machinery to perform more efficiently and reliably. Timken had sales of $3.1 billion in 2009. It has operations in 26 countries and approximately 17,000 employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/X6gaz9qFmOA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>AST Bearings receives ISO Quality Management Systems certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AST Bearings, a leading supplier of high precision bearings and related products, has received ISO 9001:2008 recertification after an extensive analysis of its quality systems by Perry Johnson Registrars Inc. While AST was previously certified compliant to ISO 9001:2000, recertification with this latest revision represents yet a further commitment to quality and reliability that customers can expect from the company and its many product offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO 9001:2008 &amp;ndash; The Latest Quality Management Standard&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Released in November of 2008, ISO 9001:2008 is the fourth and very latest release of the standard set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Unless companies comply with the more rigorous 2008 revisions by November 2010, their existing ISO 9001:2000 certifications will no longer be valid. A business seeks to attain this latest certification as recognition of efforts made to adopt a quality culture, continuous process improvement, to ensure consistent results and maintain peak customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ISO 9001:2008 provides a number of requirements that must be fulfilled to achieve customer satisfaction through products and services which meet customer expectations. This includes a requirement for planned and continual improvement of the Quality Management System. Specifically for AST, key components of their quality policy require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verified customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understanding and conforming to customer requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintaining a compliant ISO 9001:2008 Quality Assurance System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The certification represents affirmation by a third-party registrar that when purchasing AST products and services, the customer is assured of world-class quality and reliability. The ISO audit of AST was carried out by Southfield, Michigan-based Perry Johnson Registrars, Inc., one of the world&amp;#39;s foremost authorities in quality certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verified Improvement to Customer Satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Consistent with the latest ISO 9001:2008 standard, AST actually verifies its customer satisfaction. For the past three years, it sent out standardized surveys to its customers to determine its current performance in the following five key areas: Sales/Customer Service, Engineering, Quality, Shipping Delivery, and Overall while soliciting feedback on outstanding performance and areas to improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tom Berendsen, AST&amp;#39;s quality assurance manager, affirmed, &amp;quot;Deploying and maintaining a Quality Management System that requires verification and continual improvement has made a big difference for our customers. For example, I now have proof that our customer satisfaction levels have increased.&amp;quot; Berendsen continued, &amp;quot;Using 2007 as a baseline (which was a pretty good year for us), our customers said that in 2008 we improved our customer satisfaction by 7.5 percent. In 2009, our customers said we improved yet another 7.0 percent.&amp;quot; Berendsen summarized, &amp;quot;Because of our Quality Management System, if ever an issue arises, we identify and resolve it quickly. As a result, many of our customers have gone on record that we are simply their best supplier, bar none.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Services Also Pass Intense Scrutiny&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Of particular note regarding AST&amp;#39;s recent ISO 9001:2008 certification, it also included their Design and Development processes. Most bearing suppliers don&amp;#39;t even have in-house bearing design and engineering services. Whether trouble-shooting an existing problem or help with creating new product specs, customers of AST should have greater peace of mind knowing that their processes have been scrutinized and passed inspection by the renowned auditing firm of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top-Down Commitment to Quality and Improvement&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dale Kaminski, CEO at AST Bearings, commented on the company&amp;#39;s recent ISO 9001:2008 certification. &amp;quot;AST has always had a commitment to quality,&amp;quot; says Kaminski. &amp;quot;This is a core value for AST that permeates every level of our company from senior management on down. Each and every one of us at AST Bearings is committed to delivering quality products with outstanding reliability along with the very best service and support. Our new ISO 9001:2008 certification is yet another example of our company providing &amp;#39;value beyond the part&amp;#39;. For our customers, it represents further assurance that when they purchase a product from AST, they are investing in a superior product backed by an organization that stands behind everything it sells.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raising the Bar ... Continuously&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The new ISO 9001:2008 standard by definition does not allow a company to &amp;quot;rest on its laurels.&amp;quot; AST is required to have continuous improvement, even above the levels achieved in 2009. According to company executives, AST has several initiatives that will help usher in a new level of customer satisfaction rarely found bearing supply industry. Companies from all industries can expect even more from this New Jersey based company who step-by-step is helping to re-define the bearing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About ISO 9001:2008&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continual improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

            <title>Deere reports Q1 earnings of $243 million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Net income attributable to Deere &amp;amp; Company was $243.2 million, or $0.57 per share, for the first quarter ended January 31, compared with $203.9 million, or $0.48 per share, for the same period last year. This is according to a corporate report released on February 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Worldwide net sales and revenues declined 6 percent, to $4.835 billion, for the first quarter compared with $5.146 billion a year ago. Net sales of the equipment operations were $4.237 billion for the period compared with $4.560 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Results for the quarter reflected solid execution of our operating and marketing plans throughout the company and are especially gratifying in light of global economic conditions that remain stubbornly weak,&amp;quot; said Samuel R. Allen, president and chief executive officer. &amp;quot;We are clearly seeing benefit from efforts to win customers with advanced new products while taking cost and asset discipline to an even higher level.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Operations&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Net sales of the worldwide equipment operations decreased 7 percent for the quarter, including a favorable currency-translation effect of 5 percent and improved price realization of 2 percent. Equipment net sales in the United States and Canada declined 8 percent for the quarter. Net sales outside the United States and Canada were down 6 percent, with a favorable currency-translation effect of 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deere&amp;#39;s equipment operations reported operating profit of $315 million for the quarter, compared with $307 million last year. The improvement primarily was due to lower raw-material costs, improved price realization and the favorable effects of foreign exchange and product mix. Partially offsetting these factors were lower shipment and production volumes and higher postretirement benefit costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;#39;s focus on disciplined asset management continued to produce solid results. Trade receivables and inventories ended the quarter at $5.873 billion, representing a reduction of $1.439 billion, or 20 percent, from a year ago. Trade receivables and inventories at the end of the quarter were equal to 29 percent of previous 12-month sales compared with $7.312 billion, or 28 percent of sales, last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Net income of the company&amp;#39;s financial services operations was $85.1 million for the quarter compared with $46.8 million last year. Results were higher primarily due to improved financing spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company Outlook&amp;nbsp;and Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Company equipment sales are projected to be up 6 to 8 percent for fiscal 2010 and up 4 to 6 percent for the second quarter compared with the same periods a year ago. Included is a favorable currency-translation impact of about 3 percent for the year and about 5 percent for the quarter. For the full year, net income attributable to Deere &amp;amp; Company is anticipated to be approximately $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Allen, the company&amp;#39;s focus on rigorous cost and asset management puts Deere on a strong footing to respond to a recovery in the global economy and, longer term, to help meet a growing need for food, shelter and infrastructure. Said Allen, &amp;quot;In our view, positive developments based on the world&amp;#39;s prospects for population and economic growth hold great potential and should help our company deliver value to customers and investors well into the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Payroll employment in January 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Total non-farm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in January (-20,000), according to the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Bureau of Labor Statistics.&amp;nbsp;The change in total non-farm payroll employment for November 2009 was revised from 4,000 to 64,000, and the change for December 2009 was revised from -85,000 to -150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Nonfarm payroll employment over-the-month change, seasonally adjusted, January 2008âJanuary 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20100216.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2010/ted_20100216_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Construction employment declined by 75,000 in January, with non-residential specialty trade contractors (-48,000) accounting for the majority of the decline. Since December 2007, employment in construction has fallen by 1.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, transportation and warehousing employment fell by 19,000, due to a large job loss among couriers and messengers (-23,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Temporary help services added 52,000 jobs in January. Since reaching a low point in September 2009, temporary help services employment has risen by 247,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This employment data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/"&gt;Current Employment Statistics&lt;/a&gt; program and is seasonally adjusted. Data for the most recent two months is preliminary. Monthly revisions result from additional sample reports and the monthly recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual benchmark process also contributed to these revisions.

            <title>Reducing wear particulates in a coal pulverizer gearbox</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	By Ken Nicholas, director of lubrication market services, Schroeder Industries; Richard Winslow, senior lead engineer, PacifiCorp &amp;ndash; Naughton Plant; and Ted Naman, technical coordinator for industrial lubricants and greases, ConocoPhillips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A coal-fired power plant operating in the western U.S. was experiencing short gearbox life in its coal pulverizing operation. The AGMA 6EP (ISO 320) gear oil recommended by the OEM failed to provide adequate lubrication and protection based on oil analysis results and gearbox inspection after one year of operation. This was confirmed by excessive wear metals and lower viscosity in the used oil reports. Further analysis of the used EP gear oil indicated excessive buildup of particulate contaminants in the lubricant and depletion of the EP additive package. The contamination consisted primarily of dirt/coal dust and metallic particulates being generated by bearing and gear tooth wear, and a chain reaction of excessive wear was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulverizer gearbox description and operating costs&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The pulverizer gearbox design dates back to the early 1960s. A steel worm gear driven by a large 800 rpm electric motor drives a bronze bull gear that is directly connected to a grinding table. The sump holds 255 gallons. The gear oil temperature is controlled by an integral water-cooled heat exchanger. The unfiltered ISO 320 EP gear oil is recommended by the gearbox OEM to provide lubrication to the bronze on steel gears and bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although this gearbox design is rugged and simple, maintenance costs were becoming excessive and maintenance outage/overhaul intervals did not support power generation schedules. Typical maintenance costs and intervals for each pulverizer gearbox were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil changes required every 12 months at a cost of $5,000 in material and labor and $20,000 to $50,000 in lost electrical production, typical of most coal-fired power generation units of this timeframe. This particular plant had 13 of these coal pulverizers installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		After 10 years of operation, the bronze bull gear was rotated to expose the unworn gear teeth face side. This required four weeks of turnaround time, including maintenance work, at a total cost of $300,000 per unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Every 20 years of operation, a complete rebuilding of the gearbox was required. Parts and labor for this effort exceeded $450,000 per gearbox, with lost production costing another $250,000 per pulverizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Breaking the wear chain reaction&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Preliminary analysis of worn components indicated that the bronze gear face was experiencing significant sliding contact and spalling. As time after overhaul increased, the bronze gear face wear became more and more significant. Plant personnel began to search for a better lubrication system to break the wear chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plant personnel suspected that the wear patterns on the bronze bull gear faces were attributed to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High particulate loading of coal dust and dirt in the gear oil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Chemical attack of the EP additive package during operation, most likely due to sulfur-phosphorus EP additive being active on the bronze bull gear, resulting in high levels of copper in the gear oil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Catalytic reactions between the gear oil additives and some of the particulates generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plant personnel began to address these issues on multiple fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Search for methods to better seal the gearbox from particulate ingestion (primarily coal dust)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Filtration methods/options for the gear oil to quickly capture the particulates and generated wear particulates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Enhanced lubricant technology (both base oil and additive packages) to provide extended maintenance intervals without energy use penalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Problem resolution&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Success was achieved in the following areas in breaking the wear chain reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Particulate ingress: &lt;/strong&gt;This was successfully controlled through the use of breather desiccant filters on the gearbox vents and by very close attention to the grinding table seals. Initial ISO Cleanliness Code of 23/21/18 (per ISO 4406-1999) was achieved with aggressive breather filtration as shown in Appendix 1 at the bottom of this article. Previous attempts at particulate counting were unable to establish the target ISO cleanliness level due to the very high levels of particulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Filtration method and customer requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;Historically, the ability to filter ISO 320 and 460 gear oils in a coal pulverization environment was proven very difficult. Plant personnel determined that a kidney loop filtration system is one of the options to remove particulate contaminants from the pulverizer gearbox and to address the gear wear issue. The kidney loop filtration system must have the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Adequate flow rate to handle the higher viscosity gear oil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High dirt holding capacity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Low maintenance; filter changes should not exceed once per month under normal operating conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to show gear oil cleanup within one week after maintenance is performed on the gearbox&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continue to clean up the gear oil and maintain target cleanliness code of 18/15/11 per ISO 4406-1999&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide pre- and post-filtration sampling points for evaluation of filter effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skid mounting installation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Suction and discharge locations designed to eliminate fire hazards, and the entire gearbox oil sump was turned over every 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Filtration skid size that did not interfere with normal maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Kidney Loop Filtration System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in filtration technology&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An advanced filtration technology for this application was determined to be readily available for heavy gear oil that would meet the above requirements. An off-line kidney loop filtration package using a high-efficiency, high-dirt-holding capacity, synthetic filter media was procured and installed. The package uses two filter housings mounted in series, with a common-sized element in both housings as shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The filter elements initially recommended for the trial installation were rated at Beta 25=200 in the first stage and Beta10=200 in the second stage. Oil flow was delivered by a vane pump rated at 10 gallons per minute for a 460 centistoke (cSt) (2,500 SUS) gear oil. Temperature ranges of the system fluid varied from a low of 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) when idle, up to 130&amp;deg;F (54&amp;deg;C) during normal operation. The filtration package is installed with the suction line coming into the filter bank directly from the bottom of the reservoir; the outlet, or filtered discharge line, is piped directly into the top of the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The filter element condition is monitored by differential pressure gauges installed on each filter housing with a target of 25 to 28 psig as an indicator of element loading; the elements were changed out prior to allowing the internal bypass valve to begin opening. Other features of the filtration package include upstream and downstream sampling valves to allow gear oil samples to be taken without having to shut down the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in lubrication technology&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The OEM recommended an AGMA 6EP (ISO 320) gear oil for the pulverizer gearbox. Evaluation of the wear patterns on the gear teeth indicated that the EP additive package in this gear oil was too active on the bronze bull gear and was causing premature wear in conjunction with the contaminants in the gearbox. Analysis of used gear oil samples confirmed that the EP additive package was being depleted. Depletion of the EP additive package was determined to be from continuous sliding of the bronze on steel gears and exposure to high temperature. This was confirmed with IR thermographic imagery. Very high dirt and particulate loading was confirmed by the ISO Cleanliness Code, as shown in Appendix 1. It was obvious then that the OEM-recommended EP gear oil did not provide adequate protection for the gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on these findings, and after consulting with the lubricant supplier, it was determined by all parties that AGMA 7 (ISO 460) synthetic gear oil would best protect the gearbox in this application. The higher viscosity grade and improved lubricity of this synthetic gear oil, coupled with R&amp;amp;O additive chemistry, provides a higher oil film strength than that recommended by the OEM, and would extend the life of the gearbox, taking into account the temperature requirements and gearbox longevity. The physical properties of the synthetic gear oil are shown in Table 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;ISO Grade 460&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1. Physical Properties of ISO 460 Synthetic Gear Oil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past, plant personnel had evaluated the feasibility of using a synthetic gear oil in the pulverizer gearbox, but it was determined the high dirt loading in the gearbox made these uneconomical with frequent oil changes. However, with improved filtration now available, providing a potential oil life of at least three years, the economics of using a synthetic gear oil could be justified. The synthetic ISO 460 gear oil offered several benefits including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Enhanced pumpability at lower temperatures and, therefore, enhanced filterability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Higher oxidation resistance and thermal stability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Higher film strength at high and low temperatures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Extended service life in a clean, filtered environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational results&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The pulverizer gearbox was overhauled and all major rotating components were replaced, except the steel worm gears. The gearbox was wiped clean and dry with lint-free rags as part of the overhaul process. The steel worm and bronze bull gears were precision aligned and blue checked. The reservoir was flushed with an ISO 460 mineral oil and was then filled with the synthetic ISO 460 gear oil. A baseline gear oil sample was drawn from the reservoir and analyzed for particle count per ISO 4406-1999. The ISO Cleanliness Code result was 23/21/18. The pulverizer gearbox was put into service along with the filtration system. Following three hours of run time, the particle count was reduced to 21/19/11 as shown in Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After 48 hours of run time, the plant installed a set of Beta 5=200 filter elements in each housing to further reduce the system contamination and achieve the target ISO Cleanliness Code 18/15/11. The pulverizer gearbox and filtration system continued to run for another two weeks with element condition being monitored using the differential pressure gauges. As a result of using the Beta 5=200 filter during these two weeks, the target ISO Cleanliness Code 18/15/11 was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Filter element service life was also monitored during the trial installation; results showed that the high-dirt-capacity media exceeded expectations, given the initial clean-up of the system, plus the service life during ongoing usage has been beyond the norm. Average service life to date, using the Beta 5=200 media is one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="381" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/nichols002.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the trial installation, oil samples were taken and analyzed for physical and chemical properties, particle count and analytical ferrography. The results showed the wear metals were reduced significantly and the oil cleanliness was maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Given the success of this initial installation, the power plant continues to achieve the following benefits by using the ISO 460 synthetic gear oil and new filtration system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Significantly improved gear and bearing lubrication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Minimal to non-existent wear metals in the gearbox to date based on the oil analysis reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No increase in drive motor energy consumption due to using a higher viscosity synthetic gear oil. Some plant instrumentation measurements indicated a 1 percent drop in motor amperage (4160 VAC motors)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Particle count and analytical ferrography are now realistic options for accurate predictive/proactive maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Gear oil life is extended and provides the additional benefits of reduced disposal costs and reduced environmental impact / waste oil generation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Gearbox life is significantly extended&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Contamination-related downtime is eliminated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance intervals are extended&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Since applying the lubricant upgrade and the first filtration package and closely monitoring the results, the power plant has since purchased and installed their second unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>How to troubleshoot bearing defect frequencies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When learning vibration analysis, we are taught that determining bearing defect frequencies is as simple as a mathematical formula. Simply input some numbers and presto! While this is the fundamental technique needed to determine these frequencies, there are some other important considerations that need to be made. If you find that you have a frequency that you believe is a defective bearing but you just cannot get the frequencies to line up with your fault frequency overlays, here are some things you need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Check the true running speed of the machine. You may have the machine identified as an 1,800 rpm machine that is actually running at 1,780 rpm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure the bearing characteristics match those in your vibration database. Most vibration software comes with a database of bearings. You may find your bearing number in that database; however, the actual bearing may be slightly different. The bearing may have one more or one less ball than the selected bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if axial loading is occurring. High axial loading will change the roller path and thus effect the frequency calculations. As the axial load increases, the rollers have less distance to travel because they are being forced on the raceway shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if wear is an issue. As a bearing wears over time, the distance the rollers have to travel will increase as a result. The rollers will actually decrease in diameter as wear occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if you have identified the right bearing. Occasionally when equipment is rebuilt, the original bearings are replaced with a similar bearing of a different brand. This can lead to differences in bearing defect frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure you have enough resolution to separate defect frequencies from running speed harmonics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you follow these simple guidelines for determining the proper bearing defect frequencies, you will find that your fault overlay will match your suspected bearing defect frequencies a much higher percentage of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Amish communities see benefits in plastic bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	An Ohio-based manufacturer of horse-drawn farming equipment predominately employed by Amish communities uses iglide plastic plain bearings from igus on a &amp;ldquo;crumbler&amp;rdquo; mechanism; used to crush clods of dirt during the tilling process. The bearings replaced a system of metal shafts and collars that required messy lubricants and frequent maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	iglide G300 bearings are used on each of the crumbler&amp;rsquo;s eight rolling elements. Grease fittings made the rollers susceptible to dirt build-up, which eventually led to the formation of a thick sludge as the tool sat idle in-between harvests. Fortunately, iglide bearings are lubrication-free and dirt- and dust-resistant and so are ideal for use in this outdoor application. They are also unaffected by rain and any moisture from the soil, thanks to their corrosion-resistant and low moisture absorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	iglide plastic plain bearings are available in 28 different polymers. Every iglide bearing material possesses a number of special features, which makes it suitable for particular applications and requirements. iglide G300 bearings are cost-effective and can be paired with a number of different shafting materials. They are best for rotational and oscillating movements and low to average running speeds. They also possess a low coefficient of friction and high wear-resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

	While there has been a significant loss of repetitive manufacturing jobs, workers with engineering and high-tech skills remain in demand and are vital to keeping manufacturing and the economy going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent survey conducted by Deloitte, Oracle and the Manufacturing Institute revealed that more than half of U.S. manufacturers reported significant shortages of &amp;ldquo;high-skilled workers.&amp;rdquo; But who will fill these high-skilled jobs when according to The Manufacturing Institute &amp;ldquo;half of the manufacturing workforce will turn over in the next decade as Baby Boomers retire?&amp;rdquo; Who will be there to innovate job-creating products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doug Mitchell, development engineer at Ford Motor Company Design and a member of the Rapid Technologies &amp;amp; Additive Manufacturing Community (RTAM) of SME is concerned about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Not enough engineers are being trained in the U.S. That&amp;rsquo;s one reason work is being outsourced,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And he believes that this shortage may have something to do with the perception that &amp;ldquo;manufacturing engineering is not considered a glamorous profession like law or medicine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Mitchell is working to change this by introducing young people to one of manufacturing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cool factors&amp;rdquo;: rapid or additive manufacturing, or the process of using 3D imaging and layered manufacturing to create physical objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mitchell should know. His work relies on this process to develop such auto components as instrument panels, grills and other auto design features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Outside of the office, he serves as a mentor in the Bright Minds Mentor Program, a program developed by the RTAM Education &amp;amp; Information Exchange Tech Group within the Society of Manufacturing Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In its seventh year, Bright Minds pairs additive manufacturing industry mentors with high school students. This year, the program is being sponsored by The Boeing Company and OBJET Geometries. Bright Minds will take place as a part of SME&amp;rsquo;s RAPID 2010 and 3D IMAGING Conference and Exposition, May 18-20 at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Bright Minds is a good opportunity to get an idea of what engineers are doing,&amp;rdquo; Mitchell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Local students from Cypress, Kennedy, El Toro, Tustin and Trabuco Hills high schools will be introduced to prototyping, tooling and additive manufacturing industries as prospective career choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I enjoy seeing the light bulb go on in students as they see some of what can be done with 3D imaging and additive manufacturing,&amp;rdquo; notes Mitchell. &amp;ldquo;Last year, we had kids see how the technology can be used to create a physical model of a World of Warcraft figure. They could also see how it can be used on the medical side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beyond Bright Minds, the RAPID 2010 and 3D IMAGING Conference and Exposition also engage young people through the Design for DDM Student Design Competition. DDM is a manufacturing process which relies on building parts from 3D computer-aided design (CAD) files or data often used in rapid manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now through April 6, 2010, Bright Minds students, Bright Minds alumnus, as well as entrants from various high schools and universities are invited to submit computer-aided design &amp;ldquo;inventions&amp;rdquo; based on the theme of &amp;ldquo;eco-friendly household products.&amp;rdquo; Previous competitions have encouraged students to submit innovations based on computer and automotive design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Winners of this year&amp;rsquo;s competition will be announced at the RAPID 2010 and 3D IMAGING Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing analysis: Troubleshoot the problem, not the failure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The objective of this article is to develop the mind-set of detecting and fixing problems and not just detecting failures. We often see examples of totally wrecked bearings and, alongside, the spectral and vibration data that detected the failure. To this end, there must be a multi-stage approach: the vibration monitoring program must be used to detect the problem at the earliest opportunity, and the maintenance department must act on that (and that may not be to change the bearing; it may just be a lubrication problem). If the bearing is changed, it is essential that it is changed at the right time. That is the key. If it is changed too early, people say the system is flawed. If it is changed too late, it may damage other components, and the evidence that can tell us what the problem was may be destroyed. The aim is to be proactive and not reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The decision-support system SKF Bearing Inspector is aimed at offering increased speed, consistency and higher quality in the bearing decision making process. It should help to prevent bearing damage or failure from recurring. As with any knowledge-based computer system, SKF Bearing Inspector gathers all the relevant information and experience available about rolling bearing damage &amp;ndash; from basic principles to practical engineering results. Causal relations between symptoms and possible reasons do not exist in reality and can easily lead to wrong conclusions. This is simply because the reasons (e.g., wrong bearing mounting) result in the damage symptoms (e.g., signs of fretting) and not the other way around. A modeling of a relationship from causes to symptoms where uncertainty is attached to &amp;ldquo;possible failure states&amp;rdquo; fits much better with the physical phenomena that occur during bearing service life. With the aid of state-of-the-art computational intelligence techniques, this approach has been followed for the development of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article will follow the ISO 15243:2004 standard as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Condition monitoring tools are often used as a way to detect defects or failure patterns in rotating machinery. We often use condition monitoring tools to be predictive in our maintenance planning to subsequently be reactive in what we actually do. Before we can study how we can use the tools to prevent the failures, we need to understand some of these buzzwords and look at what we need to do in order to use the collected data. There also must be a strategy for determining what to collect and how to turn the data into effective information. Take the case of a bearing (figures below): Did we do a good job in detecting the problem or did we just detect failure? You could say we prevented a catastrophic failure of the machine, but what was the cause and can we prevent it happening again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Cyclical Time Analysis of the Bearing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This bearing had failed a number of times, but all that was done was to change the bearing, which is a very expensive and time-consuming job. By taking a time block of data, it is possible to then join the ends to show the data in a profile plot. This time block represents one revolution of the bearing. The data is then time synchronous averaged using a virtual trigger set by the time length of 1 rpm. This data now clearly shows that there are two load zones in this bearing, and that will eventually lead to stress in the inner race and cage, and failure will occur. The journal was checked and found to be oval; it was then machined and the bearing correctly fitted. The bearing has been in service since and shows no sign of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root cause failure analysis and proactive maintenance worked. It is important to use these techniques before the functional failure occurs. The key is to troubleshoot the problem, not the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubrication&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When the lubrication of a bearing starts to fail, it generally causes an increase in vibration, noise or acoustic emission. A lubrication management regime is often based on listening to the bearing. This can work but, by far, the best way is to trend the data against engineering units. The following trend shows what happened to a bearing when it was lubricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="324" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/courtney004.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It can be seen that it apparently solved the problem, but the level of vibration never returned to the level from before the problem. The increased level after lubrication was due to small particles of debris still in the grease. The time waveform data was taken during the act of greasing the bearing. It can clearly be seen that the problem has been hidden by greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decision-support system for bearing failure mode analysis&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Gaining insight and information from rolling bearing damage and failures is of strategic importance for SKF and its customers. The knowledge collected on bearing damage is accessible for SKF engineers as a Web-enabled decision-support system called SKF Bearing Inspector. Allied with the knowledge of how bearing defect patterns appear in condition monitoring systems, root cause failure analysis can be greatly enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The decision-support system, SKF Bearing Inspector, is aimed at offering increased speed, consistency and higher quality in the bearing decision-making process. It should help to prevent bearing damage or failure from reoccurring. As with any knowledge-based computer system, SKF Bearing Inspector gathers all the relevant information and experience available about rolling bearing damage &amp;ndash; from basic principles to practical engineering results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Current knowledge-based systems have benefited from the experience of expert systems developed in the 1980s, although these suffered major flaws in aspects of reasoning capacity and computer power. These systems were often structured as decision trees that led from symptoms to possible causes. Causal relations between symptoms and possible reasons do not exist in reality and can easily lead to wrong conclusions. This is simply because the reasons (e.g., wrong bearing mounting) result in the damage symptoms (e.g., fretting signs), and not the other way around. A modeling of a relationship from causes to symptoms &amp;ndash; where uncertainty is attached to &amp;ldquo;possible failure states&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; fits much better with the physical phenomena that occur during bearing service life. With the aid of state-of-the-art computational intelligence techniques, this approach has been followed for the development of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge system&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Within a knowledge system, one generally distinguishes between modeling the knowledge with a certain knowledge representation and the reasoning principle, in order to derive problem-solving capacity. Regarding knowledge representation, several forms exist, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cases: &lt;/strong&gt;Many bearing failure experiences can be found in case examples. Unfortunately, many practical cases are not well documented, and no uniformity regarding the documented parameters or failure mode conclusions exists. Example cases can, however, be used to model or verify other knowledge representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rules: &lt;/strong&gt;It is possible to generalize if-then rules between observed symptoms and possible causes. However, this is not appropriate because different causes can have similar effects that appear as similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Artificial neural networks: &lt;/strong&gt;Mathematical relationships between symptoms and causes can be derived by using example failure cases. However, there are not sufficient numbers of discriminating cases to do this. Furthermore, system users require additional explanations rather than &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; artificial neural network relationships that do not carry such explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Probabilistic networks: &lt;/strong&gt;It is possible to derive visual networks, in which nodes are connected by causal relationships, based on bearing failure theory and experience. Furthermore, probabilities are assigned indicating the weakness or strength of those relationships. By introducing correct causality from conditions to observations, this knowledge representation best fits the bearing failure diagnosis problem. Analysis of bearing damage and failure is principally a diagnostic task. Imagine a patient visiting his doctor with a specific complaint. The doctor first questions the patient about specific body and lifestyle parameters such as weight, smoking, etc. (conditions). Based on that information, the doctor makes hypotheses about likely diseases (failure modes). The doctor verifies or rejects these hypotheses through further questioning and inspection of the patient (symptoms). The process of a damage or failure analysis is similar to the doctor&amp;rsquo;s approach. In a correct diagnosis, there are two reasoning steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hypotheses generation is where possible failure hypotheses are generated based on data. For example, the doctor starts asking questions to get an idea (hypothesis) of what could be wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verifying or rejecting hypotheses. One by one, the generated hypotheses are investigated and verified or rejected. For example, the doctor starts investigating the most probable diseases by conducting specific medical tests (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a probabilistic network, the two-step reasoning is implemented by forward and backward probability calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;More about probabilistic network&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The probabilistic network is a visual network in which nodes are connected by causal relationships, and probability calculations are applied. The network for bearing failure analysis has four node categories: conditions, internal mechanisms, failure modes and observed symptoms. Conditions represent the conditions from and under which the bearing operates. Examples are speeds, bearing type, load, temperature, installation details, environmental factors, etc. Internal mechanisms represent the physical phenomena that happen during operation, such as lubrication, film disruption, sliding contact, etc. Failure modes represent the types of failure, such as subsurface initiated fatigue and fretting corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Table 1, the various failure modes are listed. Observed symptoms represent the observable phenomena inside and outside the bearing, including discoloration, spalling, rust, etc. Approximately 150 nodes are connected by causal relations between conditions of the bearing application, hidden mechanisms, physical failure modes and observed symptoms. In the modeling of the network, various sources of information were used. Apart from defining the nodes, the causal relations and probabilities, explanation texts (for each node) including examples and pictures are developed. In total, approximately 250 pictures have been included in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case study from Bearing Inspector&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Bearing Inspector contains several common bearing damage cases located under &amp;ldquo;Typical Cases&amp;rdquo;. These can be used as training material to demonstrate how the Bearing Inspector supports the analysis of a bearing damage investigation. One example is of an electric motor in a paper mill. In this case, an electrically insulated cylindrical roller bearing NU 322 ECM/C3VL024 is used in an electric motor of a paper winder in the reel section of a tissue paper machine. The electric motor speed is variable (400 VAC with frequency converter) and running between 1,000 and 1,500 min-1. After only a month of operation, however, heavy wear was observed on the inner and outer rings. Loading the example case in SKF Bearing Inspector sets all known application conditions (Step 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first hypothesis of possible failure modes is calculated based on these application conditions. At this point in the analysis, Bearing Inspector gives a high likelihood of false brinelling, adhesive wear and current leakage. At first sight, current leakage and false brinelling seem unlikely because the machine uses insulated bearings and all machines are properly supported with rubber pads. The user then has to perform the second step of the analysis by inspecting the bearing on failure symptoms. Clicking &amp;ldquo;inspect&amp;rdquo; results in a list of damage symptoms most relevant to the selected failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing is first inspected for false brinelling. Because no shallow depressions are found that can verify false brinelling, this failure mode is rejected. The analysis is continued with inspection of symptoms of adhesive wear. None of the symptoms related to adhesive wear are found, either. Finally, by inspecting electrical current leakage symptoms, the presence of small pitting is found after magnification of the raceway surface. This verified the current leakage failure mode. Subsequently, the customer indeed discovered an earthing problem in the winder construction causing the electrical current leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="323" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/courtney008.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8. Example Step 1: Application conditions are filled by loading the electric motor winder data among other bearing type, coating, speeds, etc. Detailed information and examples are provided under the information button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="326" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/courtney009.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;

	&lt;img height="176" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/courtney010.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 10. Example Step 3: Inspection on symptoms for current leakage failure mode. After inspection and enlargement of the runway surface, small pitting is confirmed. Several examples are provided under the information button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="138" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/courtney011.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 11. Example final diagnosis: Results are based on the provided application conditions (Step 1) and bearing system inspections (Step 2).Both the probabilities of the most relevant failure modes and related internal mechanisms are listed. The results can be printed out as a Microsoft Word document or an HTML report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead of investigating all possible observations and non-filled-in conditions, the most relevant ones are suggested, dependent upon the failure hypothesis (or internal mechanisms) that need to be investigated. In other words, these are the application conditions or observations that have the most discriminating effect on the failure hypothesis. The discriminating effect is determined by a mathematical measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For all possible not-filled-in conditions or observations, this measure is scaled between 0 and 100. An example is given in the illustrations. Eventually, by investigating the application conditions and observations, the likelihood of the failure hypotheses and internal mechanisms is determined and ranked. These then form the conclusions of the bearing damage analysis. The system is further extended with various functions that can help the user. A simple file with user instructions is provided for getting started. Session data control is available for session data storage and retrieval. Also, in a file marked &amp;ldquo;Typical Examples&amp;rdquo;, users can be guided through the application of the program. For convenience, an extensive report can be generated in Microsoft Word or HTML format, including the relevant conditions, observations and failure mode probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Bearing Inspector meets the need for a fast, more consistent, high-quality decision-making process for bearing damage and failure investigations. This Web-enabled system is available for SKF engineers to support customers in bearing damage and failure investigations. It can help to determine how a bearing failed and, therefore, how to ensure that the same failure cannot happen again. These failure patterns should then be used to determine how to configure a vibration-based condition monitoring program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/k8IeP2M6ZdU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>An examination of false brinelling and static corrosion in bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When an electric motor is not properly cared for during storage, damage to its bearings may occur. The two main failure modes that occur are false brinelling and static corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	False brinelling occurs when vibration from passing warehouse machinery results in the bearing&amp;#39;s rolling elements vibrating against the raceway in a single location. Over time, this vibration can remove small bits of metal. This type of wear appears as evenly spaced marks lining up with the spacing of the rolling elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Static corrosion occurs when either vibration or the weight of the rotor shaft resting on the rollers forces out the grease between the rollers and the bearing raceway. The problem is compounded if the grease has little or poor corrosion inhibitors. When the film is no longer present between the metal surfaces, galvanic corrosion occurs leading to rust deposits on the machined surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prevention is as simple as ensuring the bearings are properly greased prior to being placed in storage. The type of grease and date should be tagged to the motor. The motor itself should be placed on a vibration absorbing material such as wood. Finally on a routine basis the shaft of the motor should be rotated to ensure the grease is redistributed and maintains a corrosion preventing film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>SKF celebrates 100th anniversary in United Kingdom</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In February 2010, the Luton-based engineering company SKF will be celebrating its 100th anniversary in the United Kingdom. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF was originally founded in Sweden in 1907, but quickly opened its first overseas sales office in London in 1910. The following year, the company came to Luton, choosing a site on Leagrave Road to build a manufacturing facility for the production of bearings.&amp;nbsp;These products are used in almost every piece of equipment with rotating parts; for example, in industrial machinery, printing presses, mining and quarrying systems, and in cars, trains and aircraft.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Today, SKF is recognized as a global knowledge engineering company, with a wide range of products, of which bearings manufactured in the U.K. continue to form a key part. These products are now produced at the company&amp;rsquo;s purpose built Sundon plant and U.K. headquarters, which opened in 1936 &amp;ndash; production at the Leagrave site ceased in 1977.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Sundon factory currently produces spherical and CARB toroidal roller bearings for heavy industrial applications; SKF also offers a range of support services from the Sundon site, including machine tool spindle repairs and the refurbishment of Taper Bearing Units (TBUs) for the railway industry.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition, SKF has a number of other facilities across the U.K.; in Aberdeen, for the delivery of maintenance strategy and services to the offshore oil and gas sector; in Gloucester, for the manufacture of high-performance bearings in the aerospace sector; and 11 centers across the U.K. for the production of custom engineered sealing solutions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Phil Burge, U.K. marketing manager, believes that, &amp;ldquo;Although SKF is a major global corporation, with production plants around the world, our U.K. engineering base in Luton has always played an important role in the overall success of the company, both at home and abroad. Even during the recent economic recession we have still managed to maintain a strong level of output, which we anticipate will grow in coming years as the pace of global recovery picks up.&amp;nbsp;As a result, we anticipate continued investment and development of our U.K. manufacturing center in Luton, giving us the basis for another century of success in the U.K&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/WILLtWrUFR0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Best practices for lubing API centrifugal pump bearing housings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	More and more plants have goals focused toward extending the mean time between repairs (MTBR) for their rotating equipment, which includes centrifugal pumps for use in petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries. Maximizing the lubrication effectiveness in API process pumps will be a big contributor toward meeting this goal. In this article, you will learn about optimal ways of lubricating the bearings in API process pumps, including data on discs vs. oil ring lubrication, maintaining the proper level and contamination control. Bearings that are properly lubricated with minimal contamination will operate at lower temperatures and for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article is focused on horizontal centrifugal API (American Petroleum Industry) process pumps but many of the topics/concepts can also apply to ANSI pumps. There have been various studies done on why rolling element bearings fail prematurely, and consistently, the No. 1 cause can be attributed to poor lubrication. One particular study stated that 50 percent of damage is caused by defective lubrication. Poor or defective lubrication can be classified as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Incorrect lubricant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Incorrect quantity of lubricant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Contaminated lubricant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Lubricant degradation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="145" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/thomas001.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Typical Bearing Failure Causes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The API Standard 610 requires a minimum bearing life (L10) of 25,000 hours with continuous operation and rated conditions and at least 16,000 hours at maximum loads and speed. The L10 life is the number of revolutions that 90 percent of a group of identical bearings under identical conditions will endure before the first sign of fatigue failure occurs. If we assume 80 percent run time per year (292 days per year), the minimum expected bearing L10 life would be 3.5 and 2.2 years, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As cited above, poor lubrication will cause 50 percent of these bearings to fail before any signs of fatigue occur. These failures can occur within a few hours after installation, after one year, or just before fatigue. At what point prior to fatigue do these bearings fail can be extended by following the 5 R&amp;rsquo;s of Lubrication: Right lubricant, Right quantity, Right location, Right time and Right quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies are requesting L10 life ratings of 40,000 hours (5.7 years) when purchasing new pumps, but it is still important to address poor lubrication practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incorrect Lubricant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anti-friction bearings in process pumps can either be grease, mineral oil or synthetic oil lubricated. The primary purpose of oil, or the oil constituent of grease, is to separate the roller elements and raceway contact surfaces, lubricate the sliding surfaces within the bearings, and provide corrosion protection and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Viscosity is the single most important property of a lubricant. Use of the correct viscosity lubricant for the speed, operating temperature and load ensures the development of a full oil film between rotating parts. When the incorrect viscosity is used, the load-carrying ability of the lubricant is negatively affected. The oil degrades to a point where it is too thick to penetrate between the surfaces and the oil supply may not be adequate to prevent sacrificial contact. Viscosity is influenced by load, temperature, water, contaminants and chemical change. The OEM operation manual should be consulted for recommendations on viscosity, but it is also important to measure the oil sump operating temperature since viscosity decreases as temperature increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="73" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/thomas002.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: SKF Recommendation for Ball Bearings in Pumps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil in process pumps is typically an ISO grade 46, 68 or 100. These numbers relate to the Kinematic viscosity in centistokes. The oil is usually hydrocarbon oil, although synthetic oils are sometimes used for specific lubrication applications. The viscosity of synthetic oil is less sensitive to temperature changes and more widely used when temperature fluctuations exist. If temperature also exceeds 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit), a synthetic is recommended as the oxidation rate of mineral oil accelerates faster at higher temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incorrect Quantity of Lubricant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Selecting the right lubricant for the application was the first step, and the next is to determine the correct quantity is initially applied and maintained. It is important to understand the design of the bearing housing assembly and, more specifically, the designed oil level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil Level &amp;ndash; Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most common types of methods for lubricating rolling element bearings in horizontal process pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Grease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Oil splash (direct contact, rings or flingers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Pure oil mist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Purge oil mist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The use of grease is primarily limited to lower horsepower pumps where the parameters are in the size and speed range of rolling element bearings. Oil splash lubrication is the most common method utilized. Oil splash designs include direct contact, oil rings, flinger discs or combinations of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In direct contact, as the shaft rotates, the rolling elements in the bearing make contact with a level of oil. The bearings should not be submerged in the oil more than one-half the diameter of the lowest rolling element or ball (Figure 2). Oil rings are utilized where speed or loads are factors and the oil is not in direct contact with the bearing. Oil rings make contact with the oil and provide splash type lubrication without direct bearing contact. Flinger discs are similar to oil rings in that the oil is not in direct contact with the bearing. The discs make contact with the oil and provide splash type of lubrication. Oil rings are more dependent on the shaft speed relative to the depth of submersion, but a good rule of thumb to use is to use three-eighths of an inch at the deepest point. Flinger disks are less susceptible to problems of over-lubrication since they are attached directly to the rotating shaft and they should also submerge about 3/8 inch into the oil. A combination design would incorporate a metallic disc and direct contact. The bearings directly contact the oil and the disc provides additional splash lubrication for cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="391" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/thomas003.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Pump Cross Section &amp;ndash; Oil Splash/Direct Contact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic concept of the oil mist lubrication system is dispersion of an oil aerosol into the bearing housing. Air atomizes the oil into particle sizes of one to three microns. Airflow transports these small oil particles through a piping system into the pump housing which flows through bearings. It is a centralized type of low-pressure lubrication system. In pure mist lubrication, the oil/air mist is fed under pressure to the housing. There is no reservoir of oil in the housing and oil rings are not used. Purge mist lubrication utilizes the same principles of pure mist, but a reservoir of oil in the housing exists. A slinger/flinger disc or oil rings can also be used to provide splash lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a low-level operating condition, the bearing will not receive enough lubricant necessary for proper film strength &amp;ndash; a precursor to surface contact, skidding and possible catastrophic failure. Without enough oil to prevent friction, thermal runaway can happen quickly to a steel bearing. As the temperature of the bearing increases, the ball and race both expand, which creates an even tighter fit. This increases the temperature even more, and the cycle continues to a rapid, catastrophic failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A low level of oil will affect all types of oil splash lubrication. In direct contact, there will be insufficient film strength and rings or discs may not be able to pick up enough oil to satisfactorily lubricate the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a high-level operating condition, churning of the lubricant will occur, accelerating the oxidation rate due to excessive air and elevated temperatures. It is a common mistake to believe that more is better &amp;ndash; especially when it comes to oil sump lubrication. Too much oil can affect the operation of oil rings, flingers and direct bearing contact. Another result of high lubricant levels is leaking seals. If the oil level is too high, the ring will become submerged and no longer sling the oil. Flinger discs are less susceptible to this as they are directly attached to the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintaining Proper Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil sump lubrication does not require that a specific level be maintained for proper bearing load &amp;ndash; only that oil levels do not reach critically low or high points (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="285" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/thomas004.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.Typical Oil Level Conditions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintaining the proper quantity of lubricant is perhaps the easiest means of increasing lubrication life and effectiveness. Consult with your equipment manufacturer or the operation manual for recommended oil levels, optimum lubricating equipment and preferred practices. The majority of equipment will have an external marking on proper oil level that is either cast into the housing or a tag is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most widely used methods of maintaining the proper level lubricant in a bearing housing is the constant level oiler (Figure 2). The constant level oiler replenishes oil lost by leakage through seals, vents and various connections, and plugs in the bearing housing. Once the proper level has been set, replacing the oil in the reservoir is the only required maintenance. View ports (bullseyes) can also be used to verify proper oil level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Constant level oilers have a &amp;ldquo;control point&amp;rdquo; that must align with the proper oil level of the equipment. The oiler is installed on the equipment and oil is filled to the proper level. All constant level oilers require air to function properly. If the oil level within the sump lowers, the seal at the control point is broken, allowing air to enter the reservoir, displacing the oil until the seal is re-established. If the constant level oiler is set correctly and there is oil in the reservoir, the equipment will always have the optimum oil level within the sump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contaminated Lubricant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quality of lubrication is affected by contamination, which is a large contributor to premature bearing failures. The major types of contaminants are particulate, moisture, incompatible fluids and air entrainment. Particles impede lubricant performance and further localize pressure on components causing denting, fatigue, spalling and abrasion to the surface of mating surfaces. Water will affect the lubricant&amp;rsquo;s ability to provide a proper fluid film, causing premature failure and excessive wear. Corrosion, cavitation, and premature oxidation and filter plugging of the oil are other symptoms of water contamination. Air contamination affects oil compressibility, causes poor heat transfer, film strength loss, oxidation and cavitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sources of these contaminants are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Generated contamination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; External ingression of contaminants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Maintenance induced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generated Contamination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Particle contamination can be generated during the break-in or during operation of the pump. Oil rings are typically made of bronze and are sensitive to horizontality of the shaft, speed and oil levels. They can tend to skip or hang up due to these sensitivities and make contact with other components. The rings will wear, being a softer material, and particle debris is generated. These small particles can penetrate the critical area between the rolling elements and the raceway resulting in abrasive wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;External Ingression of Contaminants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pressure differentials between the equipment housing and surrounding atmosphere are a leading cause of contamination ingression. Pump operation where housing temperature fluctuations occur during frequent on/off running conditions, process fluid temperature changes, outdoor use and air flow over the pump create this atmospheric exchange as pressure is equalized. During this air exchange, contamination (dirt, water, etc.) from surrounding environment is &amp;ldquo;breathed&amp;rdquo; into the oil sump through vents, seals and oilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Housing components &amp;ndash; including oilers, seals and vents &amp;ndash; when specified properly can be very effective in preventing contamination. For many years, constant level oilers were used to maintain oil levels. Most of these were vented to the surrounding atmosphere, which can lead to contamination ingression to the housing sump. By switching to a non-vented oiler and removing vent plugs, ingression can be significantly reduced. Bearing isolators are used to prevent lubricant leakage and contaminant ingress. Labyrinth-type bearing isolators are most widely used on horizontal pumps. Bearing isolators allow increased pressure created by normal pump operation to vent through the seal and have proved to be very effective at reducing contamination ingression. The rotor and stator are not in contact, which allows for the venting to occur while preventing wear &amp;ndash; prolonging the life of the seal. Magnetic or face seals are used to prevent damage to bearings due to contamination and lubricant leakage. Face seals are characterized by optically flat stationary and rotating faces loaded together by magnetic force or springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintenance Induced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contamination can exist in the oil prior to being put into the equipment. It cannot be assumed that new oil is clean. Proper storage of oil and proper dispensing containers will also decrease the possibility of water or other contaminants from entering into the bearing housing. Proper care should be taken during the pump rebuild process to ensure any contamination is properly removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubricant Degradation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All lubricants will degrade over time, requiring the oil to be changed. The frequency of these changes can be extended by maintaining the quality of the lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Elevated operating temperatures are a major contributor of oil oxidation. Combined with air, particulate and water contamination, the chain reaction of oil oxidation begins. Additives are affected first, followed by the basestock, which leads to machine and component surface wear and fatigue. For every 8 degrees C (18 F) increase in oil operating temperature, the oxidation rate doubles. This can be significant when considering pump operating temperatures are frequently near, or above, 60 C (140 F). By simply lowering the operating temperature of the oil to 50 C (122 F), a 50 percent reduction in the rate of oxidation would be realized &amp;ndash; doubling the effective life of the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most basic methods to reduce (or maintain) lower oil operating temperatures are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Use the correct viscosity oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Use quality oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Use the right amount of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Keep the oil clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Air entrainment is a primary source of oxygen in the oxidation failure of oil. New oil can contain as much as 10 percent air at atmospheric pressure. Splash-type bearing housings utilizing flinger rings or slingers are all aeration-prone applications. Excessive aeration has a negative effect on acid number (AN), oil color, film strength and viscosity. In addition, air entrainment can lead to accelerated surface corrosion, higher operating temperatures and oil varnishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating temperatures can vary with each type of lubrication method. The graph below was based on laboratory testing measuring operating temperature of the oil sump from startup until the temperature leveled off. Two tests were run using ISO 68 weight oil and operating speed of 3,600 rpm. One test had the oil level at mid-ball of the lowest rolling element and the other had the oil level dropped below and a flexible flinger disc was installed to provide splash lubrication. The flexible flinger disc operating temperature was 9 F lower than the direct contact operating temperature. As stated above, this reduction in temperature results in a 25 percent decrease in rate of oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of proper lubrication in process pumps is well known, but achieving it is not always easy. It is important to start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the correct lubricant for the application&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Viscosity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mineral or synthetic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand how the pump is designed to properly lubricate the bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil splash, oil mist&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the lubricant at the proper level&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Constant level oilers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visual verification of level via bull&amp;rsquo;s-eyes or sight gauges&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep the lubricant free of contaminants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close up housing &amp;ndash; reliable seals, breathers, non-vented oilers, expansion chambers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper storage and handling of lubricant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil analysis for verification of type of contaminant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the operating temperature within the pumps&amp;rsquo; design parameters&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Follow above guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding the pumps&amp;rsquo; components as well as the surrounding environment is critical for applying the correct and most economical lubrication management system. Obtaining the designed L10 rating of the bearing can be obtainable by eliminating poor lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tips to predict bearing failures, measure lube film thickness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, there are two options of maintenance concerning electric motor bearings. One is to relubricate them and the other is to change them. Monitoring electric motor bearing condition is paramount to insure reliability. Electric motors are an asset that must be managed, and prolonging their life will insure more contribution to the bottom-line profit. Preventing collateral damage caused by electric motor bearing failure is true cost avoidance. There are several ways to monitor and measure bearing condition &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; ultrasonics, temperature, vibration analysis and shock pulse, just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because lubrication is the first line of defense for prolonging bearing life, it is imperative that the lubrication film thickness between the rolling elements and the raceways be measured and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubrication film thickness: What matters&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lubrication is the vital element between any moving parts and an absolute requirement in rolling element bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There has always been much discussion and debate regarding the questions of how much, how often and what kinds of lubricants should be used in rolling element bearings; and to many, it still remains a mystery. The following chart (Figure 1) indicates the many parameters related to the lubrication film thickness and film quality in a rolling element bearing. Even &amp;ldquo;sealed for life&amp;rdquo; bearings will lose their lubrication film thickness. Knowing how much lubricant is left in a sealed bearing can make the difference between productive uptime and unscheduled downtime. Knowing if lubricant is getting into the bearing will allow maintenance to maximize bearing life by optimizing oil film thickness and unscheduled downtime can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Differentiating between bearing surface damage and lubrication film thickness, as a bearing fault, is a measurable function. Knowing the difference is valuable knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case study No. 1: Maxim Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scrubber for cleaning contaminated water before dispersing into the waste water system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Four small 3/4-horsepower motors with integral &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; face mounted impeller pumps plumbed with PVC piping.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All four motors are running at the same time. (Figure 2.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After demonstrating how to monitor bearing condition and measure lubrication film thickness at this printed circuit manufacturing plant, we were asked to look at a small water scrubber. The screaming sound of a bad bearing could be heard, but they could not pinpoint which bearing was making the noise. Was it the drive end or opposite drive end of which motor? After a quick check, the bearing was identified and its condition was determined. This was a 6204.2RS sealed bearing (a sealed-for-life bearing). The cost was about $9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We left the plant with the promise to provide a quotation for a portable data logger instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the night, the bearing froze up and tripped the motor, so only three motors were now running. They lost one-fourth of the capacity of the system to clean water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day (before the repair could be made), the Bay Area Environmental Protection Agency inspector showed up. Water was still being dumped into the wastewater system. Because of the lessened capacity, when the water was tested, it did not meet the cleaned requirements. The fine was $32,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sad part is that they knew which bearing was bad. They also knew how bad it was. If predictive maintenance or condition monitoring was a part of their normal operating procedures, this downtime and fine would have never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 700-horsepower ABB electric motor for driving a fan for dehydrating milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB motors have long recommended the use of shock pulse to measure their motor bearings. Many ABB motors are equipped at the factory with SPM adapters for quick-connect measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ABB motor was installed at Laprino Foods and failed within the warranty period. The bearing froze up and twisted the shaft. There was no lubrication in the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After careful review, the records showed that the maintenance personnel in the plant had indeed greased the bearing according to the recommended schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seal cap was removed from the end bell of the drive end exposing the bearing for inspection. It was found that a machining error was made during manufacture and the grease pathway from the grease zerk to the bearing lubrication notch did not line up. Grease could not get into the bearing. Even though the lubrication schedule was being adhered to, the bearing was not being measured, so no one could tell if lubricant was actually getting into the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production was interrupted so a new motor was taken from the electric motor shop&amp;rsquo;s inventory to replace the damaged motor. Before installing the new motor, a test run was performed. While the motor was running, a measurement was taken while lubricant (grease) was applied to the zerk. Without disassembling the motor or causing an intrusive action, it was determined that the grease pathway was in the correct place and lubricant was truly getting into the bearing. The bearing&amp;rsquo;s true condition was determined and the lubricant film thickness was measured and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB honored the warranty. The damaged motor was repaired and stored for a spare and the new motor is still running today. An online monitoring system (MG-4) continues to monitor these ABB electric motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 3: Evanite Fiber Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		A 125-horsepower motor and belt drive on an exhaust fan for a spun glass process used to make high-density filters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This example was not necessarily on the motor, but on the fan shaft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common bearing installation faults that affects lubrication film thickness is the installation and set-up of the tapered bore, double-row spherical roller bearing using a split tapered adapter in a mounted unit (i.e. pillow block bearing). While this is not an electric motor bearing,it is in very close proximity to every drive motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tapered adapter is used as a wedge device to hold the inter race of the bearing on to the shaft. All bearing manufacturers have recommended clearances for applying this type of bearing. This type of bearing in a pillow block housing is very common on larger fan applications and is a very popular style for many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="243" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps004.jpg" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the tapered sleeve (adapter) is drawn up too far by over-tightening the spanner nut (a very common practice), the internal clearance of the bearing will be removed, thus reducing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though these bearings are running with no apparent fault or vibration alarm, the reliability of the machine has been put into jeopardy because the operator cannot see the film thickness problem. Lubrication film thickness can be measured to determine the true condition of the bearing during start-up without setting a baseline and treading. Differentiating bearing surface damage faults and lubrication film thickness faults is powerful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 4: Superior Lumber Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25-horsepower motor driving an edger in a sawmill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standard foot mounted motors that are mounted in the vertical position must have special consideration related to lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The normally mounted bearing in a horizontal motor is supporting load/overhung load in the radical direction. If the motor is mounted in the vertical position, the bearing will see more thrust loads and the lubrication will run out through the opening of an open or shielded bearing. A sealed bearing will hold the lubricant reservoir in the lower half of the bearing because the bearing is lying on its side in this application. This position will also force all of the balls of a ball bearing to one side of the raceway, thus placing them all in a more loaded situation in both radial and thrust directions. Load affects the lubrication film thickness. Normally, a motor mounted in this position will need lubricating more often than what is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="298" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps005.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The ability to measure the lubrication film thickness is paramount. Better asset management and machine reliability can be obtained by measuring the film thickness as soon as the machine is turned on. This will prolong bearing and machine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is critical. It can be measured to detect and troubleshoot for proper lubrication amounts (over/under), the right kind of lubricant for the right job, to detect installation faults and even to pinpoint the lack of film thickness if there is a compatibility and/or contamination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing the film thickness of lubrication in rolling element bearings, even a sealed bearing, is information worth measuring. Lubricant should only be applied to rolling element bearings because of demand requirements. Measuring the bearing film thickness before you lubricate will insure that there is truly a lubrication requirement. Automatic lubrication supply systems can provide the optimum amount of lubrication at just the right time when signaled by an online measuring system. Knowing the lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is instrumental in best asset management practices. Knowing what really matters in rolling element bearings to insure machine reliability is knowing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/1SfkXA8h3KM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The lean replacement of bearings, pumps and motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary downtime is not just an operations problem. The time that it takes to change out a bearing, a pump or a motor can add up over time to equal significant losses in production output. Eliminating non-value-added steps in the changeover of these parts will reduce scrap, improve equipment utilization and reduce labor costs while increasing total production output. The multi-step process includes eliminating waste in the process, identifying work that can be completed while the equipment is running (external work), and improving the reliability of both the internal and external work steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improvements are ensured by creating effective work procedures and using workplace organization principles. Reductions in changeover time are typically 20 to 50 percent, or greater, depending on various system characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The principles of lean manufacturing are well known. The components of the methodology as well as the overriding philosophy have been written about exhaustively. What is left upon which to expound is the application of the lean methodology to more and greater diversity of manufacturing scenarios. This article endeavors to explain the major tenets of lean manufacturing and how certain lean tools might be applied to a common maintenance activity in order to generate significant improvements in overall business performance. The improvement from utilizing lean tools influences all business metrics &amp;ndash; not just maintenance or operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scene&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At 7 p.m., Bob received a call that a critical reactor pump was making a terrible noise. Never mind the fact that he was already working on a piece of equipment that operations said was critical (that is a scenario for a different article). The clock was ticking on this new problem and, like a well-mannered doctor, Bob hurried to the &amp;ldquo;patient&amp;rsquo;s bedside&amp;rdquo; to perform an initial examination. His diagnosis was that the pump was definitely near catastrophic failure. In fact, he thought it might not last until the end of the shift if it was allowed to continue to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob asked the operator to shut down the affected reactor, explaining that he would need to replace the failing pump. The operations group reassigned the operator to another job. Production output dropped accordingly and, even though operations knew how long the job always took, the area manager called Bob just to confirm that the diagnosis and prognosis were as suspected. Somehow the situation felt old and familiar to Bob. In fact, it felt too old &amp;ndash; and too familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob had been a maintenance technician for 10 years and was quite good at it. He paid close attention to detail, took great pride in the quality of his work and was generally open to new methods for increasing both the quality and quantity of the work that he was able to produce. Recently, he had been spending greater lengths of time contemplating how he could get more work done in a single shift. He already worked hard, but the work seemed to be coming quicker in recent months than he and his co-workers could sustain. There had to be a better way he thought as he began the work of replacing the reactor pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old process&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Bob retrieves his toolbox and begins the process of removing the pump so that the new one can be installed. From experience (he has replaced pumps just like this one so many times that he can nearly do it without looking), he knows that the job will take eight hours from start to finish. Sometimes, of course, things do not go so smoothly and the job can run into several shifts of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Bob begins work on the pump removal, he begins to wonder if there is any way that the pump replacement process could be improved to reduce the time required. He knows that the job is not performed frequently, but it seems that it always has to be performed just when other assets are crippled and production demand is at its highest. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law, he supposes. Still, if the process time could be reduced, it would help maintenance and operations both. It occurred to him on his second trip to the stores area that one immediate improvement would be to eliminate these frustrating trips to retrieve tools, fasteners and other required parts that become necessary when the situation becomes abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During years of replacing these pumps, Bob has learned what common tools are required for the job. Of course, he carries these tools in his toolbox. However, his toolbox would be the size of a truck if he tried to carry every special tool and fastener that he might need for any job in the plant. He was definitely ready to make some improvements that would lower his frustration level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The principles of lean&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Over the past several months, Bob&amp;rsquo;s friend had been telling him about this methodology called lean manufacturing that companies were using to eliminate problems in their manufacturing environment. Bob&amp;rsquo;s friend told him that he thought some of these techniques would help Bob make improvements in his own job. Bob was skeptical but his friend finally convinced him to read some articles and a couple of books explaining the lean manufacturing concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concepts he read about seemed quite radical and almost too simple for him to believe that they could really produce the benefits that they claimed. Nevertheless, he found some of the concepts curiously intriguing. In a last-ditch effort to make some sense of all of it, Bob decided to summarize for himself everything that he had learned so far. Then, he thought, he would give it one shot at work (when the time was just right, of course) to see if he could reap some of the reward that his buddy had been bragging about. If the methods did not work, he was not going to waste his time with this &amp;ldquo;lean stuff&amp;rdquo; any longer. On a piece of notebook paper, Bob wrote: Principles of Lean. Under this heading, he began to list them as he understood them from his reading. When he was finished, his list looked like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;Principles of Lean&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate Waste (there are seven types of waste)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waiting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overproduction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Transportation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rework or Reprocessing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Defects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess Motion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Achieve Continuous Operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use Only One-piece Flow&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organize the Workplace&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continually Improve (one improvement every day, no exceptions)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work Together (get ideas from anyone and everyone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thought crossed Bob&amp;rsquo;s mind immediately. This is certainly a simple philosophy &amp;ndash; only six major tenets as he saw it. He was beginning to think that there might be some merit to this methodology. In fact, he decided to simply identify some ways that he could try to apply some of the lean concepts to his work activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After looking over his ideas and spending a few days continuing to work in the current environment, Bob thought to himself that he might as well find out if these crazy ideas would work. After all, if they really worked to reduce operations downtime it would certainly be viewed as a great benefit for the business and reflect positively on him. He would start small and work slowly through the first exercise. If his lean activities did not produce improvement, he would revert to the old methods and cut his losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He made a second list that described specific ways that these concepts could help him be more efficient without compromising either safety or quality. This list was really going to be simply a &amp;ldquo;To-Do&amp;rdquo; list for his next pump replacement job. His second list looked like this when it was completed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;Lean Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Map each step of the entire process identifying purpose of the step and how much time is consumed by the step&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify which steps contain waste and which type of waste&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify a way to eliminate (or, at least, reduce) the waste&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organize the area immediately around the reactor pump (make a place to store everything needed for the pump replacement job &amp;ndash; including common and special tools)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Look for ways to utilize quick-release features (e.g., fasteners, plumbing connections)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Document the new process so that it can be repeated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with this list, a notebook and some markers (for creating a process map), and a healthy dose of skepticism, Bob headed for his manager&amp;rsquo;s office. If he could convince his manager of the potential improvements of a lean environment, he would be ready to start work on his first lean implementation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new process&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;After Bob&amp;rsquo;s first round of improvements he was convinced that the tools of lean manufacturing could actually work to make improvements in both the quality of the work he was doing and the time required to complete that work. As he reviewed the new process, he realized that his notes echoed what he had been studying in the lean texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new process was visibly different from the old process. The area had shelves and pegboard installed with labels identifying exactly what was to be located and where it was to be located. The contents on the shelves consisted of tools, fasteners and other items that were always (or nearly always) needed in the process of replacing a reactor pump. The shelves and other storage features were located as near to their points of use as reasonably possible. Bob found that this activity alone removed a significant amount of time from the total process time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety guards that were in place in the reactor area were another visible change. Bob was able to determine that the safety guarding was merely to prevent accidental ingress into unsafe areas of the reactor pump system. Consequently, there was no need for the guarding to be fastened with threaded fasteners which required excess time and energy to remove and were a periodic source of additional downtime as the threads would eventually be ruined and require more time for repair. In place of the threaded fasteners, Bob installed some quick release toggle clamps that were stocked in the stores inventory. He even managed to find a way to utilize quick connect couplings to speed the process of removing and installing the pump. Again, he was able to remove several minutes from the total cycle time through this simple change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, during his improvement exercise, Bob identified several steps of the pump replacement process that could be completed prior to stopping the production process. The total process time required to replace a reactor pump was measured from the moment the production process stopped until the moment it was restarted with the new pump. Therefore, Bob realized that performing as much work as possible prior to stopping production output would reduce the operations downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once he moved those tasks from internal to external (an internal task is one that can only be accomplished when the asset or production process is stopped), he found that he could make them a bit more efficient. This reduced the pump replacement time yet again. This was clearly a positive improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the efforts of his first improvement exercise, Bob identified several more ideas to implement in &amp;ldquo;Round 2.&amp;rdquo; He was certain that he could reduce the pump replacement time even further. In fact, he believed that his most radical idea would reduce the time required by an additional 50 percent &amp;ndash; maybe more. He was convinced that if he could find a way to implement the model used by auto racing&amp;rsquo;s pit crews, the pump replacement job could be performed using less than 20 percent of the time that was originally required. By his calculations (and with some help from the accounting department) he determined that the time saved would more than pay for the extra maintenance labor required for his &amp;ldquo;pump pit crew&amp;rdquo; idea. By now Bob is also certain that every technique that he has used to reduce pump replacement time can be applied to motors, bearings and, for that matter, any other work that he performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The results that can be achieved through an implementation of the lean methodology vary dependent upon several factors. For example, in an environment where minimal improvement effort has been experienced historically, significant improvements will typically be realized immediately. Environments where a continuous improvement philosophy has existed for many years may achieve smaller improvements as a result of previous work. It is critical to note that, even in facilities where lean has been rigorously utilized for several years, there are still improvements gained each time an exercise similar to the one described in this paper is carried out. This is explained by the dynamic nature of manufacturing and the natural movement of all systems toward higher entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general, utilizing the tools of lean will generate improvements in four fundamental areas of any manufacturing or processing business. First, fewer inventories will be required as a result of a company&amp;rsquo;s flexibility to meet changing customer demands. Less inventory and increased flexibility lead to improvements in a second category &amp;ndash; faster delivery times. The third area that receives a boost from using the lean tools is quality. This includes the quality of product, processes and assets. Finally, shorter changeovers for production processes and reduced replacement times in maintenance work ultimately lead to reduced downtime which subsequently produces higher productivity. The target achieved by many companies for equipment setups or asset replacement activities is to perform them accurately and repeatedly in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantifiable results from lean typically fall into the ranges shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		30 to 50% less human effort required throughout the plant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		30 to 50% fewer defects in finished product&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25 to 35% less engineering time required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		45 to 55% less floor space for the same output&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5 to 15% less inventory (applies to product and spare parts)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		20 to 50% (or greater) reduction in changeover or asset replacement time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, as previously mentioned, these results can vary dependent upon the unique situations of each plant that endeavors to implement the tools and philosophy of lean manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The principles of lean manufacturing are really quite simple. At the heart of lean is a relentless drive to remove waste from any process. The targeted process can be virtually any task, job or project in a maintenance and reliability environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies utilizing lean techniques obtain improvements in flexibility, quality, delivery (or timeliness) and productivity. These improvements are recognized throughout the enterprise. This includes a company&amp;rsquo;s product and its processes including the work processes required for effective asset management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing mounting and dismounting guide now available</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The correct mounting and dismounting of rolling element bearings can save time and dramatically increase the life of bearings, as well as maximizing the availability of critical plant and machinery by avoiding costly breakdowns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The key here is to ensure that the appropriate tools and equipment for the mounting and dismounting of rolling bearings are on hand for the engineer at the installation or assembly stage. Appropriate tools may include thermal mounting and dismounting tools (i.e. heating plates), induction-heating devices, mounting paste and heating rings, as well as feeler gauges, hydraulic extractors, hydraulic nuts and hand pump sets. Using the correct tools ensures that bearings are mounted and removed easily and quickly without causing damage to the bearings or surrounding equipment and in a safe and reliable way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In order to help plant, maintenance and service engineers, Schaeffler U.K. recently published a new technical guide entitled âMounting and Dismounting of Rolling Bearingsâ. This handy, pocket-sized guide includes useful guidance and clear instructions on how to store, handle, clean, mount, dismount, lubricate and maintain rolling bearings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The guide also includes a special section that discusses the possible typical causes of bearing damage and failure. This includes faulty mounting, contamination, corrosion, the passage of electrical current, and incorrect bearing lubrication. There is also a section at the back of the guide that contains tabular information on bearing part numbers, bearing tolerances and their mating components (i.e. shafts and housings), bearing clearance and FAG rolling bearing greases (Arcanol).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As well as the guide, Schaeffler U.K. also offers a range of tailor-made, modular training courses on bearing mounting and dismounting, lubrication, alignment, condition monitoring and maintenance management. Training can be carried out at Schaeffler's U.K.-based headquarters in Sutton Coldfield, or at the customer's own premises.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bearing mounting and dismounting courses include training modules on rolling bearings, mounting tools, failure recognition and more specific courses such as tapered roller bearing maintenance for rail vehicles.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For your free copy of the âMounting and Dismounting of Rolling Bearingsâ guide, e-mail &lt;A href="mailto:info.uk@schaeffler.com"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;info.uk@schaeffler.com&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and ask for a copy of WL80100.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/xNDXNnmcBu4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/images_spacer.gif" width=1 height=1&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;SKF has added the battery-driven grease gun, the LAGG 400B, to its maintenance products. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The SKF battery-driven grease gun is suitable for lubricating bearings, machines, vehicles and other applications. Ergonomically designed, the new gun can be used with all standard grease cartridges, according to DIN 1284 or approximately 500 cubic centimeters (17 U.S. fluid ounces) of loose grease.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By utilizing the new SKF battery-driven grease gun, it is possible to, with minimum effort, empty a 420-milliliter cartridge within approximately 10 minutes, significantly reducing cost and time when compared to hand-operated grease guns.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>New bearings extend life on hardwood mill's induced draft fan </title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Bearings on a large induced draft fan in the boiler system at a major hardwood mill in the Northwest were failing in as little as four to six weeks of operation. Bearing life was extended dramatically by replacing the existing split-block SAF-type double-row roller bearing pillow blocks with Rexnord ZAF6000 Series SH&amp;#362;RLOK Adapter Mounted Roller Bearings. It also simplified a time-consuming installation procedure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the mill, alder, maple and other hardwoods are processed into dimensional lumber. A boiler that provides heat for the kiln burns dust from the planer/sander. After combustion, the induced draft fan removes any unburned dust as well as the ash and moves it to the bag house. The fan, approximately 30 inches in diameter, turns on a 2-7/16â diameter shaft that is supported by two bearings. Driven by a 50-horsepower electric motor through a 1.5:1 speed increaser V-belt drive, the fan runs at 2,648 rpm. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Environmental conditions including heat, dust and an overhung load contributed to the short life of the previous bearings. In addition, their split housing made it necessary to assemble the bearings and set clearances on site. The installation method for the split-housing bearings requires pre-measuring the clearance and then tightening the tapered adapter nut in increments, using feeler gauges to determine when a specified reduction in clearance is reached. If this procedure is performed correctly, the shaft grip force will be correct, but it is often performed incorrectly. If the shaft grip is too loose, the bearing may loosen on the shaft. If it is too tight, the clearance in the bearing is reduced, which can generate excessive heat. In addition, the dust and ash particles in the air made it almost impossible to keep the bearings clean during the assembly and installation procedure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_mill_01.jpg" width=445 height=334&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Bearings on this induced draft fan at a major hardwood mill were failing frequently before they were changed to Rexnord ZAF6000 Series SH&amp;#362;RLOK Adapter Mounted Roller Bearings.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Easier Installation also Helps Extend Bearing Life &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To extend bearing life and reduce installation time, the company replaced them with ZAF6000 series SH&amp;#362;RLOK bearings that are solid-housed, shaft-ready units and are a drop-in to the traditional SAF units. They are greased and the clearance is preset, so they can be taken out of the box and mounted immediately to the shaft, which eliminates contamination and clearance uncertainties. They feature a positive locking system that maintains mounting tightness during operation. The tapered adapter sleeve provides greater shaft grip and eliminates the shaft damage caused by loose bearings. In addition, the tapered sleeve makes it easier to remove the bearings from the shaft without causing damage, saving both time and repair costs. The new bearings also incorporate Spyglass Optical Strain Sensors (OSS), which provide instant feedback to achieve optimal shaft grip. They eliminate damage to the shaft and bearing caused by improper tightening during bearing installation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_mill_02.jpg" width=442 height=332&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Closeup shows new bearings in place, with induced draft fan housing at right and guard for V-belt speed increaser at left.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Two slightly different types of bearing were used in this application. While a ZAF 6207 was installed on the drive side, a ZAFS6207 was used on the fan side. The latter bearing is a floating unit that allows the cartridge that holds the bearing to slide back and forth in the cast iron pillow block housing. This permits the bearing to accommodate shaft expansion caused by heat that may be present at higher speeds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_mill_03.jpg" width=404 height=539&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Shaft between V-belt drive and fan is supported by two bearings.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;A company spokesman reports that it generally took at least three to four hours to replace the previous bearings. Typically, the new bearings can be installed in seven to 10 minutes each. He says, âWe had to assemble the old bearings and check the clearance, but with these, we just slide them in place and the sight glass shows when we have the right tension. Because they are pre-packed with grease, we donât have to guess there either.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_mill_04.jpg" width=406 height=304&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Previous split-block ball bearing design required field assembly that made it difficult to set clearances accurately and allowed contaminants to enter the bearing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The spokesman points out that a bearing failure can be expensive for the company in more ways than just the downtime and repair costs. The boiler burns 14 to 16 cubic feet of sawdust a day, but if the blower is down, the company may have to contract to have the sawdust hauled away if the silo in which it is stored is full. While the previous bearings failed regularly in four to six weeks or less, the new bearings have been in service for more than six months to date, so the savings have been significant. This success may lead to exporting the solution to other company facilities, he concludes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/Fj11GgXkAzc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Surface coating, ceramic rolling elements reduce bearing failure</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;A new surface coating for rolling element bearings has been developed by Schaeffler that insulates the bearings from damage caused by the passage of electrical current in large AC or DC motors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Schaefflerâs Isotect A coating is an insulating layer for rolling element bearings that can be applied to the outer or inner ring external surfaces. Alternatively, depending on the application, the bearings can be assembled with ceramic rolling elements.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the past, bearings used in large AC or DC motors with only a few pairs of poles were prone to damage from the passage of electrical current. Today, due to the increasing use of frequency converters, this potential danger is growing. Around 3 per cent of all electrical machines manufactured worldwide are controlled by a frequency converter. This figure is expected to rise to 10 per cent over the next couple of years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Isotect A acts like a resistor and capacitor connected in parallel. With DC voltage and low frequency AC voltage, the choice depends on the ohmic resistance of the bearing. With higher frequency AC voltage, which is often found in frequency converters, it depends on the capacitive reactance of the bearing. To ensure good insulation, the ohmic resistance should be high and the capacitance should be as low as possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Depending on the operating temperature, Isotect A has a high resistance ranging from several Ohm up to 10Gohm. To allow for the capacitive resistance of bearings used with a frequency converter, Schaeffler has selected not only the appropriate material for the insulating layer, but also the most suitable layer thickness, which both play a key role in ensuring optimum protection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As capacitance is derived from the surface area of the protective layer and its thickness, the coating is applied to either the inner or outer ring external surfaces, depending on the application. If operating conditions require even higher protection, Schaeffler offers rolling element bearings assembled with ceramic rolling elements across most of its bearing range.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;Types of bearing damage&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are typically two types of bearing damage caused by the passage of electrical current: âflutingâ and âwelding beadsâ (or craters).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fluting is relatively easy to identify and runs transverse to the raceway. The washboard appearance of the resulting pattern represents the final stage of the destruction of the raceway in a bearing exposed to the passage of electrical current. Fluting can be caused by either a continuous flow of electrical current, EDM (electro-discharge machining) or high frequency electrical current.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Welding beads or craters represent the early onset of raceway destruction and the initial stages of fluting. Identifying craters and welding beads requires detailed examination of the structural changes that have taken place in the bearing rolling surfaces. This is greatly simplified by the use of a scanning electron microscope.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Current-related bearing raceway damage is typically caused by âclassic bearing currentâ, in other words, the asymmetrical distribution of magnetic flux in mains-operated AC or DC machines, as well as to converter-induced bearing current (which occurs in the form of circular current, EDM current and rotor earth current).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Classic and converter-induced bearing current can severely damage the raceway structure and the lubricating grease, either through continuous current flow or in the form of voltage flashover and discharge. Capacitive bearing current found in converter operation is considered as harmless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In electrical terms, a bearing can be thought of as simply a connection between resistance and capacitance of the lubricant. When the elasto-hydrodynamic (EHD) condition (i.e. the complete separation of the rolling elements by the lubricant) is achieved during operation, the bearing behaviour is capacitive. In this case, the lubricant acts as an isolator, preventing the passage of electrical currents up to a specific threshold value.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, under conditions of mixed or boundary friction, the electrical behaviour of the bearing changes and is considered as an ohmic resistor. Here, the lubricant does not completely separate the rolling elements, resulting in roughness peaks and metal-to-metal contact. This can cause a continuous flow of electrical current through the bearing. During such periods of contact, the rolling elements fuse with the rolling surfaces for a short time and immediately break apart again due to the dynamics of the bearing. During this process, extremely fine metal particles are torn away from the bearing raceway and the rolling element surfaces, mixing with and contaminating the lubricant. These metallic particles are then rolled into the raceway, forming a new layer that does not have the same hardness as the original surface. The problem is exacerbated by system-related vibration and fluting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;Discharge flashes&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even though a protective lubricant layer may prevent a continuous flow of current through the rolling elements, converter operation can cause electrical discharges that penetrate the lubricant film. These âdischarge flashesâ blast fine metal particles out of the rolling surfaces, producing âcratersâ with welding beads. The resulting metallic particles add to lubricant contamination. When the number of metal particles reaches a certain level, new contacts and bridges can be formed in the contact zones. Therefore, the process takes the same course as continuous current flow, resulting in fluting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Experience gained by Schaeffler using its own and independent research has established that current densities of less than 0.1 A/mm2 do not represent a danger to bearings. However, current densities at or above 1 A/mm2 often lead to eventual raceway damage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not every bearing in an electrical machine will need to be fitted with one that has current insulating properties. With mains-operated machines, it is often sufficient to replace only one bearing with a current-insulated bearing in order to avoid possible current damage. However, when frequency converters are used, it is normally necessary to fit current-insulated bearings in several bearing locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information on Schaefflerâs Isotect A coated bearings or ceramic rolling element bearings, visit &lt;A href="http://www.schaeffler.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800080&gt;www.schaeffler.co.uk&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/Hpwd9tF7-Fw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tech tip: How to remove a bearing for repair</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Before a bearing is sent out for service, it first must be removed from its shaft housing. It is important to use great care during the removal process to ensure that the bearing, shaft and housing are not damaged.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Bearing removal is best accomplished by using a bearing puller for standard outer and inner rings, which is available through many manufacturers, including Timken. When removing bearings that have a backing shoulder that extends beyond the cone large rib, a puller that pulls through the rollers should be used. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Hydraulic pressure is another available method to remove bearings. Pullers or wedges may be used to remove the bearing after the hydraulic pressure has expanded the race. Hot oil or heat may be used along with the pullers or wedges.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Contact with hot oil or other heat sources can result in serious bodily harm. Protective clothing and safety glasses should be worn at all times.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;When the puller has been placed on the bearing and pressure is applied, the bearing race should expand and be easily removed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;There are a number of valid methods you may use to remove a bearing from its shaft. No matter which method is used, be careful not to expose any surface of the bearing to the flame of a torch. Any torch-heat damage renders the bearing as scrap. A bearingâs hardness and metallurgical structure is dramatically altered by torch heat. When it is necessary to drive out inner or outer rings, extreme care should be taken to prevent bearing seat damage, backing shoulder damage or burrs on any surface. Damage to these surfaces will prevent proper seating of the bearing and its new components when reassembled in the application.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/hZjyiYWOEH0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF offers tip on how to safety remove bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;This tip focuses on &lt;A title="removing bearings safely" href="http://cl.exct.net/?ju=fe2d157572650378751577&amp;amp;ls=fdf412727161017b70127374&amp;amp;m=fef91073706d05&amp;amp;l=fe981577706c047c74&amp;amp;s=fe5e11707565037b701d&amp;amp;jb=ffcf14&amp;amp;t="&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;removing bearings safely&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The most dangerous tool you may have in your kit might well be a two-arm jaw puller. These devices, used correctly, can safely remove a press-fitted bearing from a shaft. But in many cases, the jaws of the puller don't reach the inner ring, which would be the safest place to apply the pulling force. So, we place the puller jaws on the outer ring and tighten the center spindle of the puller to apply the removal force. If the outer ring is slightly misaligned, you're applying force to two balls or rollers, and it's much more likely you'll fracture the bearing outer ring, sending dangerous chips flying. There is also a chance the puller may slip off entirely if we aren't watching what we're doing. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

It's simply a more stable arrangement, and generally centers itself during removal.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;In all cases, if applying force to the OUTER ring, rotate the puller as you remove the bearing. You may hear the rollers "clunk" into place as the pulling force is evenly distributed through all the rolling elements to the bearings rings. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The safest method? Pull on the proper ring of the bearing â the one with the press fit. There are tools available to do the job. Is there a common thread developing here? Let's all take the time to get the right tool to do the job. It's almost always safer, faster, and less destructive to the rest of the machine parts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/WCj36wZtYak" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Steel offers corrosion resistance for roller bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The demand for rolling bearings that are able to withstand extreme operating conditions is on the increase, including dry-running and media-lubricated bearings. This demand is being fuelled by tighter legal requirements in many industries, an increased awareness of scarce resources and the need for companies to become more energy-efficient.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Schaeffler Group has launched a high performance stainless steel for rolling bearings that helps companies achieve these goals. Cronitect provides maximum corrosion resistance under extreme operating conditions, including dry running applications or when bearings come into contact with aggressive media such as water, salt spray, acids and cleaning chemicals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cronitect steel is a high-grade martensitic hardening steel that is based on the consistent refinement of high-grade NIROSteels. Through its unique composition and new thermo-chemical surface layer treatment process, Cronitect achieves an extremely high hardness. Even after 600 hours of salt spray testing in accordance with DIN 50021 SS, the material shows no signs of corrosion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The name Cronitect is derived from the chemical composition of the material (chromium and nitrogen alloying elements) and from its special heat treatment process. The âtectâ suffix is found in other Schaeffler coating products and refers to the material's excellent corrosion protection. Cronitect's resistance to corrosion is many times better than that of conventional NIROSteels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The heat treatment process optimises the surface zone and core properties of the base material. This produces a hard, wear-resistant surface zone with very high corrosion-resistance and a tough core.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cronitect is suitable for a wide range of industrial applications, including food and beverage processing, materials handling, heavy machinery (e.g. gear pumps, flow dividers), power transmission systems (gearboxes), hydraulic and pneumatic systems, consumer products and packaging.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the food industry, the demand for dry running bearings is increasing. Cronitect can be used across most of Schaeffler's product range, including rolling bearings, linear guides and plain bearings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rolling bearings that use Cronitect are available in both sealed and non-sealed versions. When used in conjunction with ceramic rolling elements, Cronitect bearings are particularly suitable for dry running operation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The second version combines conventional stainless steels such as AISI440C for the rolling elements with Cronitect rings and bearing seals. In this configuration, the focus is on extended life under insufficient lubrication and on emergency operating features.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In food processing, the use of Cronitect significantly increases the availability of machinery, providing extended maintenance intervals. For example, bottling plants typically would normally have to replace all their AISI440C rolling bearings that come into contact with cleaning detergents, every four months. With Cronitect bearings, this interval can now be doubled.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rolling bearings and linear guides are already using Cronitect for a wide range of applications in the food industry, including meat processing, filling plants, packaging machines, fish processing and poultry production.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In a recent cam control solution for a bottle capping machine company, Schaeffler replaced its original solution â a standard stud type track roller immersed in an oil bath â with a roller stud, Cronitect outer ring, corrosion-resistant steel balls and an HRS seal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The new solution requires no lubricating oil, has extremely high resistance to corrosion and aggressive media, while presenting no risk of contamination of foodstuffs. This has resulted in improved hygiene, reduced maintenance costs and higher machine availability.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In sports and fitness equipment, rolling bearings must provide excellent corrosion resistance, for example, in fishing reels, inline roller skates, cycle fitness machines, sailing equipment and for the wheel hub bearing supports on racing cycles. On fitness machines, friction has to be minimised to ensure smooth running properties. Here, the use of Cronitect eliminates the need for grease lubrication and complex, high friction seals.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/nwskWSnLxrQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Timken to sell Needle Roller Bearings business to JTEKT</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The Timken Company on July 29 announced it has signed an agreement to sell the assets of its Needle Roller Bearings business, which primarily serves customers in the automotive original-equipment sector, to Japanâs JTEKT Corporation in a cash transaction. The agreement is subject to customary regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Upon closing, which is expected to occur by the end of 2009, Timken would receive approximately $330 million in cash for the business, subject to adjustments for working capital. Proceeds from the sale will provide increased liquidity and be used for general company purposes.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;âThis transaction is a major step forward in our strategy to transform our portfolio to focus on industrial sectors with strong aftermarkets,â said James W. Griffith, Timken president and chief executive officer. âIt positions us to concentrate our resources on areas where we can realize mutual value with our customers.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The Needle Roller Bearings business was part of the broader Torrington acquisition Timken made in 2003.

            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The Timken Company is supplying tapered roller bearings for longwall shearer loaders used in underground coal mines in Poland. The loaders are produced by FAMUR Group of Poland, the largest mining machinery manufacturer in Eastern Europe.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Counterfeit SKF bearings seized in Czech Republic</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;During April 2009, the SKF Group, working in cooperation with the Czech police authorities, made a raid and confiscated more than 30 tons of counterfeit SKF bearings at a non-authorized dealer in the North-East region of the Czech Republic. In addition, products from other bearing manufacturers were confiscated. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;This dealer has been purchasing these products from non-SKF sources and selling them to both end-users and other dealers in the Czech Republic as well as other countries, mainly in Europe. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The manufacture and trade of counterfeit products is a growing global problem which increasingly affects all brands and all markets. Counterfeit SKF products and other bearing brands being manufactured and sold in the marketplace is not only illegal but also puts the end customer at a major risk since they purchase and use these products thinking that they have received genuine products. The use of counterfeit SKF products in an application can in worst case put the user, employees and the public in a serious safety risk or result in shorter service life, poor product quality or damage to equipment. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;"Our commitment to fight both the manufacture of counterfeit products and the trade in them is not only about protecting the SKF brand. It is also about protecting our customers and the public from a potentially serious safety risk and from being cheated into paying for a genuine SKF product and being supplied a fake alternative,â says Tom Johnstone, president and CEO of AB SKF. âWe are actively and persistently working on this both internally, with the World Bearing Association and with local law enforcement authorities to ensure that manufacturers and traders of counterfeit products are revealed and brought to justice. In this particular case it is very good to see that our commitment pays off.â &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;SKF is a leading global supplier in the areas of bearings, seals, mechatronics, services and lubrication systems. The groupâs service offer includes technical support, maintenance services, engineering consultancy and training. SKF is represented in more than 130 countries and has 15,000 distributor locations worldwide. The groupâs annual sales 2008 were SEK 63,361 million.

            <title>Test rig has bearing on wind turbine performance</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Alternative energy generation is becoming an important part of the power generation mix. Alongside the growing expertise in the construction of generating systems such as wind turbines is the development of ever-greater power generation. Already, turbines in operation have an installed power of up to 5 megawatts (MW). With legislation putting tough targets on CO2 reduction, it is likely that both the amount of installed wind power and the size of individual generating units will grow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With 3 MW turbines standing at a height of 90 meters, large bearing systems are required at the heart of the generation machine. This is why SKF has built the test rig to support the validation of new bearing designs and advanced calculation tools in a full-scale bearing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Germany, which operates both onshore and offshore wind farms, is one of the most enthusiastic users of this alternative energy source and, thus, an appropriate location for such a facility. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Along with increasingly greater installed power is the trend for increasingly larger bearings inside the turbines. The most commonly produced SKF main rotor shaft bearing is a special double-row tapered roller bearing with an outside diameter of almost 2.4 meters. This bearing is the largest main rotor bearing for wind turbines manufactured in series production. So far, some 1,500 bearings have been produced for one customer. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These harvesters of the wind are frequently sited in remote geographic locations, which are often difficult to access. This creates an increased demand for reliable performance of both the turbines and the bearings in the equipment. Despite its long and successful history in bearing development, using advanced manufacturing techniques and high-end design and calculation tools, SKF development engineers are faced with the need to answer a basic question from wind power customers: âAre your calculations validated?â&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After an extended evaluation of the testing strategy, the decision was taken to develop a full-scale test rig that enables the engineers to investigate these very large bearings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The SKF test center in Schweinfurt in Germany was selected to design, build and operate the test rig. A key consideration in the choice of location was the proximity to the factory for large bearings, as well as to product development engineers and the experienced staff of the department.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The development of the test rig involved a continuous assessment of the intended and the achievable goals within the set timeframe. Indeed, the rig was completed within an 18-month time frame. The design and construction of the test rig involved:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the definition of the test and measurement parameters 
&lt;LI&gt;the development of the test rig design 
&lt;LI&gt;finding appropriate suppliers for the rig components 
&lt;LI&gt;advanced calculations of the rig components and of the bearings in the loaded conditions. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Large double-row tapered roller bearings can now be tested close to the factory instead of in the final application, without all the implications of accessibility and varying operating conditions. The bearings can be tested at speeds up to 60 revolutions per minute, which is more than three times the speed used in real applications. The rig enables various lubricants, lubricant distribution and lubrication conditions to be monitored closely, while the bearing loads can be increased up to twice the load carrying capacity of the bearing. At the same time, the friction performance, elastic deformations, temperatures and other parameters are evaluated. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Design and manufacturing engineers from SKF believe that it opens new opportunities in large bearing design. Indeed, some of the first comments about the rig, with its numerous hydraulic load cylinders set on the perimeter of the inner rings, compared it with the booster of a science-fiction rocket that opens doors to new frontiers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The new test rig enables the validation of SKFâs advanced calculation tools for large-size applications in terms of friction performance, lubrication behavior, seal performance and life calculations. New designs and manufacturing processes can be validated in full scale, and important information on material response can be derived from the tests. SKFâs condition monitoring equipment installed on the rig enables the service condition personnel to hone their skills without traveling to remote locations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since the start of the testing campaign, the rig has drawn high-level attention to SKF from both customers and political leaders. The test rig proves SKFâs leadership in this bearing technology, its contribution to the reduction of energy consumption and the support in generating âgreenâ energy. The test rig will be an important stepping stone in entering the even bigger and more powerful wind turbine market of the future. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About the author:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Armin Schlereth&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;is the testing manager at SKF Automotive Division in Schweinfurt, Germany.

            <title>Proper heating practices for bearing installation</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Bearings are vital to friction management in all types of machinery â from pumps to power generators. With so much thought put into sizing and selecting the bearing itself, how come so often we ignore the actual installation of the bearing? It may seem like a minor task but the truth is that as much as 29 percent of premature bearing failures are caused by improper bearing installation. Improper installation methods such as blow-torching, oil baths or simple brute force can damage not only the bearing but the shaft as well. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;To help ensure the proper and safe mounting of bearings, alternative methods such as induction heaters should be used. Induction heaters can ensure a safe and thorough heating of the bearing in a controlled environment, which helps prevent overheating. In most cases, induction heaters are faster than alternative heating options. In addition, they are cleaner and require less power consumption, thus helping shops to become more energy efficient. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;When choosing a bearing induction heater itâs important to keep a few points in mind:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoListParagraph style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore"&gt;Â·&lt;SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Induction technology uses an electrical current which magnetizes the bearing during the heating process. Always be sure to select a heater that will âdemagnetizeâ the bearing at the end of the process. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoListParagraph style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore"&gt;Â·&lt;SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Identifying the Minimum Bore, Outer Diameter (OD), and weight of the bearing helps ensure that youâre selecting the right heater for a particular bearing size. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoListParagraph style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore"&gt;Â·&lt;SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Some heaters only come with a select number of yokes, so make sure that your heater has a yoke that is suitable for the minimum bore of your bearing. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>MSI acquires bearing technology from Foster-Miller</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;In keeping with the companyâs commitment to improved energy efficiency, leading mechanical engineering firm Mechanical Solutions&amp;nbsp;Inc. (MSI) of Whippany,&amp;nbsp;N.J., announced its recent acquisition of the technology, tooling and rights associated with the Foster-Miller (F-M) Foil Bearing. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Representing extraordinary value for MSIâs customers, this technology will facilitate decreased machinery energy consumption and will assist MSI in its ongoing efforts to serve as a leader in green energy sustainability initiatives associated with the engineering industry. The F-M foil bearing technology is part of a larger acquisition recently completed by MSI that also includes the F-M TEI (Turbonetics) Turbine / Generator set, unique radial steam turbines which offer comparatively small size and high efficiency versus traditional steam turbine designs. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;F-Mâs foil bearing technology will be integrated into MSIâs existing business of developing new turbomachinery for manufacturers. In addition, MSI plans to continue F-Mâs business of supplying the foil bearings to existing designs. A type of air bearing, foil bearings have been used primarily in aircraft auxiliary power units and other high-speed turbomachinery. In many new applications this technology is able to replace bulky and expensive traditional oil lubrication systems, while facilitating the additional key benefits of decreased energy usage, high temperature capability and reduced maintenance. Foil bearings are an enabling technology for faster, more compact, and lighter turbomachines. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;âWe are extremely excited to acquire the Foster-Miller foil bearing technology,â stated William&amp;nbsp;Marscher, president and chief technology officer of MSI. âFor machines that operate at high speeds or extreme temperatures, conventional bearings canât match the performance of the Foster-Miller foil bearing. We are confident that this pioneering technology will help our clients to realize significant cost-savings through reductions in energy consumption, and will enhance the environmental friendliness of our clientsâ operations.â &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

This bearing levitates a rotating shaft with two main elements: a top foil and a bump foil. The smooth top foil provides a scuff-resistant start/ stop surface and captures air to support the bearing, while the flexible bump foil provides an even support for the top foil and can be tailored for the required stiffness of the bearing. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

It adapts to shaft misalignment, variations due to tolerance build-ups, centrifugal shaft growth and differential thermal expansion. The self-adjusting capability makes these bearings reliable and durable. Foil bearings operate over a wide range of temperatures and operating speeds and are highly tolerant to contaminants such as dust and dirt. Since no seals or lubrication are required, they can operate in extreme temperature or caustic gas environments. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Recent advances in bearing design, high-temperature surface coatings, and computer modeling are paving the way for new applications of these bearings. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Bearing switch saves fish processor in replacement costs</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;NSKâs Asset Improvement Program has produced savings of $16,900 (Â£11,700) in replacement bearing costs for a United Kingdom processor of fresh fish. The savings have been achieved by replacing the existing bearing inserts on fish processing lines with NSKâs Silver-Lube series bearings. These are designed specifically for use in industries where hygiene considerations and corrosion and chemical resistance are important. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The bearing problem on the fish processing line centered on a conveyor which was subject to frequent washdowns â at least two per day. These were damaging the conveyor bearings through the ingress of water and contaminants. As a result, failures were being experienced every six months, resulting in lost production and increased maintenance expenditure. In total, 60 bearings were failing over a six-month period, each costing $188. Moreover, this figure was amplified by the cost of two fitters to replace the bearings; the replacement operation for each bearing taking three hours at a cost of $43.37 per hour. What this meant for the fish processor, in cost terms, was an expenditure of $26,900 every year on bearing replacement.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clearly, this cost was unsustainable. So, an initiative was launched with a view to sourcing higher-performance bearings. As part of this initiative, engineers from NSKâs Asset Improvement Program (AIP) were called in to give advice. AIP is designed for end-user bearing customers that are looking for more than just product supply. Rather, they are looking for a value-added service that actually helps them to improve reliability, reduce operating costs, and improve efficiency and profitability. These objectives are achieved by delivering tangible savings to assets, such as equipment and machinery, and also by improving the working knowledge of maintenance and engineering personnel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="Drag to a file to make a link."&gt;&lt;IMG height=337 alt=http://www.nskeurope.com/cps/nsk/eu_en/p/images/content/1.4.2.8_Silver_Lube_rgb_rdax_95.jpg?rand=842784589 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_millercoors.jpg" width=337 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The NSK engineers quickly identified the problem and suggested a solution using the Silver-Lube series of bearings. These provide an effective application solution where hygiene considerations are important, or where replacement and maintenance costs need to be minimized within hostile corrosive environments.&lt;BR&gt;The Silver-Lube bearings were installed and trials conducted over a six-month period. At the end of this period, the NSK bearings were still performing âas newâ â performance that has resulted in Silver-Lube replacing all the existing bearings on the conveyor line.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To- date, 12 months after the first Silver-Lube bearing was installed, none of the units has failed. However, working upon a factor of at least twice the life for the Silver-Lube bearings, compared to the previous units, the fish processor has calculated total savings in bearing replacement costs of $16,900 per annum. This figure assumes the cost for the Silver-Lube units â including installation â is approximately $1,000 per year, which compares favorably with the previous yearly cost for bearing replacement of $26,900.&lt;/P&gt;

            <description>&lt;P&gt;Surprising as it may seem, a particle of 5 microns or less can cause a precision bearing to fail. To put this particle size in context, a human hair is around 60 partial microns; a fingerprint 13 microns; a dust mote 25 microns; and tobacco smoke 6 microns. These particles may be minute, but with their potential for damage, the message has to be that it is vital to maintain a high degree of cleanliness inside precision bearings. It is also vital because even when small particles of foreign matter are not actually causing failure, they can ruin the bearingâs smooth running qualities and low torque values. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In general terms, dirt and contaminants that can impede a bearingâs performance are divided into three main categories: airborne contaminants, transferred contaminants and introduced dirt. Included in the first category are such items as lint, metal flakes, abrasive flakes, industrial smoke and dust. In contrast, transferred contaminants are dirt that is picked up from one source and passed along to the bearing from hands, work surfaces, packaging, tools and fixtures. Finally, the introduced dirt category deals with impurities that enter the bearings from dirty solvents or lubricants.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition to the main categories, other contaminants that are often overlooked are humidity and moisture, fingerprints (transferred through handling), dirty greases and cigarette smoke. These, in common with all the above sources of contamination, should be considered abrasive, corrosive or leading causes of degradation of bearing performance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The problems of maintaining bearing cleanliness begin the moment that bearings are removed from their protective packages. Because of this, it is best not to remove them until they are ready for use, and then only after the work area has been effectively cleaned and prepared. Once unpacked, the bearings should only be handled with clean, dry, talc-free and lint-free gloves.&lt;BR&gt;Here, care should be exercised as material incompatibility between the gloves and any cleaning solvents could result in contaminant films being transferred to the bearings during subsequent handling. Where the bearings are instrument types, even handling with gloves should be avoided in favor of surgical tweezers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, cleanliness extends not only to the bearings themselves, but also to work and storage areas, benches, tools, fixtures and housings. A clutter-free work area, with good lighting, organized tool storage, handy parts bins and appropriate work fixtures, constitutes an ideal working environment. Under no circumstances should food or drink be consumed on or near work surfaces. Smoking should not be allowed in the area where bearings are being replaced; and bearing installation operations should be located away from other machining operations, such as grinding and drilling (etc.) to help minimize contamination problems. &lt;BR&gt;A further stricture regards static electricity, and other operations that may cause the steel rings and balls of the bearings to become magnetized. These could result in dust of fine metallic particles being introduced into the bearing. If there are any signs that the bearings have become magnetically induced, then they should be passed through a suitable demagnetizer while still in their original sealed packaging.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also key to maintaining cleanliness is a good workbench surface material, such as metal or plastic. Generally, painted metal is not desirable as a work surface because it can chip, flake or rust. Plastic laminates may be acceptable and are easy to keep clean. In addition to a good surface, every workbench should have a well-stocked complement of clean, burr-free tools that are designed for the job. The tools should not be painted or chrome-plated as these can provide a source of particulate contamination, which might ingress and damage the bearing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The requirement for burr-free components also extends to all other parts of the bearing assembly, especially housing interiors and shaft seats. These two areas should also be thoroughly cleaned before fitting.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Plant milks the savings from solid-lubricant Molded-Oil bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;NSKâs solid-lubricant Molded-Oil bearings are providing cost savings of Â£9,992 per annum as a result of solving a problem of premature bearing failure on an IHT conveyor at a milk processing plant in the United Kingdom.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The cause of the problem on the conveyor was inaccessible bearings that were impossible to lubricate. As a result, engineers were changing bearings every 10 weeks, resulting in combined downtime, labor and equipment costs of Â£9,922 annually.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Obviously, this ongoing cost was unsustainable; so an initiative was launched with a view to sourcing more durable bearings. As part of this initiative, an engineer from NSKâs Cost Savings Program was called in to give advice. The program is designed for end-user bearing customers that are looking for a value-added service that actually helps them to improve reliability, reduce operating costs, and improve efficiency and profitability. These objectives are achieved by delivering tangible savings to assets, such as equipment and machinery, and also by improving the working knowledge of maintenance and engineering personnel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The engineer quickly identified the problem to be water washout, which is extremely common in food processing applications. This is the tendency of lubricant to be flushed out of conventional bearings under repeated washdowns. The loss of lubricant is usually progressive rather than immediate; but the result is inevitably the same: premature failure of the bearing or bearings concerned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NSK has worked with majors in the food and beverage industry on this problem, providing a very effective solution, known as Molded-Oil. These bearings employ a special solid lubricant that effectively addresses lubricant loss due to washdowns. As such, it transforms the performance of machinery, in terms of reliability, maintenance- free intervals and operation, in environments exposed to high humidity, corrosion and contamination.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Molded-Oil can significantly increase the operating life of grease lubrication in water-contaminated environments. Moreover, the technology means that operating environments are kept free of grease; and there is no need for refilling of lubricant, as Molded-Oil provides a continuous supply of lubricating oil. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this milk plant application, NSK recommended F-UC206 Molded-Oil bearing inserts to overcome the failure modes. These bearings cost Â£99 but are saving nearly Â£10,000 per year. In addition, NSK also recommended changing the existing housings for the bearings to Silver-Lube units. A range of mounted bearing units designed specifically for use in industries where hygiene considerations and corrosion and chemical resistance are important â typically bottling and brewing, food processing, pharmaceuticals, fisheries and chemical processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/EwB3FxAAmAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>NSK cuts customer costs with extended bearing life</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;NSK Corporation on February 23 announced the introduction of its bearing reconditioning program. As the economy continues its descent into recession, businesses are evaluating every dollar they spend, aiming to cut costs without sacrificing quality and performance. Because bearings are critical in virtually every manufacturing and industrial application, they are the ideal place to explore cost reduction opportunities.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;No industry is immune to the current economic climate, especially the hard-hit manufacturing sector. NSK offers a cost-effective method of reconditioning bearings to prevent costly replacement and reduce downtime associated with damaged bearings. Utilizing a reconditioning program also aids in reducing the potential long lead times of purchasing new bearings.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Paper mill bearings and many other types of bearings can be excellent candidates for the reconditioning program. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;"Bearing reconditioning is a precise science that provides superior results that extend the life of existing bearings, eliminating the need to discard or replace valuable parts," says NSK segment manager Donald Robertson. "Bearings reconditioned by NSK are just as reliable and perform just as well as their new counterparts, which makes them a cost-effective option for our customers seeking to reduce bearing replacement costs."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;NSK's reconditioning program is generating significant cost savings for customers. For instance, after being contacted by a global paper company to improve the current cost-saving program at a Michigan mill, NSK was able to save the company more than $75,000 by inspecting and reconditioning existing bearings, thereby avoiding complete replacement. NSK was also able to help the mill track and monitor the bearings during the reconditioning process, offering additional efficiencies for the mill.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Bearing damage can result from many factors â incorrect lubrication, improper installation, misalignment, excessive heat and vibration â all of which are every day challenges in industrial applications. NSK's reconditioning process can combat the effects of damage and significantly extend bearing life.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Vibration analyzer ensures bearing reliability in gearbox refurbishing</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Fifty years of ongoing development has given SKF a bearing vibration analyzer that can probe deep into rotating bearings while they are under load. Initially used as a production line tester, itâs now proving invaluable during the maintenance and refurbishment of gearboxes and other critical units in demanding applications such as aerospace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF vibration testing equipment is released by Rolls-Royce for noise testing of bearings during gearbox servicing. Release became necessary when Rolls-Royce Deutschland decided to transfer service work on gearboxes for secondary power systems to the sub-contractor Vector Aerospace in Almondbank, Scotland. Overhaul of these gearboxes requires detailed inspection of more than 3,000 components, some of which require testing with special equipment. This includes the various types of rolling bearings used in the gearbox that require stringent noise and vibration testing and measurement of the radial and axial clearances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vector Aerospace selected SKF as the best suitable supplier of test equipment for the bearing tests, but before putting the equipment to use, it was necessary to run a release process with Rolls-Royce Deutschland. A detailed test and acceptance program was developed by Rolls-Royce Deutschland using reference and series bearings of different manufacturers to confirm the usability of the noise-test equipment after its installation at Vector Aerospace site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development of SKF vibration testing equipment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good first step toward solving any problem is to get the facts. Thatâs exactly what a group of senior engineers at SKF did in the early 1950s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF already had a proven reputation as a leading rolling bearings manufacturer. Its bearings were used successfully in countless applications all around the world. They were made from quality materials, using the most up-to-date production processes and carefully checked before packaging. So, what was the problem?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was said that collectively the group members knew everything there was to know about bearing materials, bearing design, bearing manufacturing and bearing applications. But still, the SKF engineers had a problem. They were concerned about the causes of failure that bearings from all manufacturers were exhibiting. Minute exterior examination of bearing components and bearing assemblies could only take them so far. They wanted more facts. They wanted to probe deep inside a bearing while it was rotating and while it was under loads similar to those it would experience in service.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Intuitively, they knew that vibrations caused by the rotating and flexible parts in a bearing caused noise and could be a source of wear and bearing damage. But they also felt that understanding the vibrations better could tell them even more â perhaps even tell them what caused the vibration in the first place and how to design and manufacture in order to reduce the vibrations and the corresponding wear. And so, SKF set off on a path to develop an understanding of vibration phenomena in bearings as well as a method of measuring vibrations and connecting this back to distinct causes, as specific as rolling element-induced vibration or damaged ring-induced vibration, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the mid-1950s, the group had successfully created its first vibration testing equipment for analyzing structure-borne noise and vibration in bearings. They went on to develop equipment that would reveal problems hidden within a bearing such as dirt particles, cage noise or form deviations in a component. Their search had revealed the factors that could lead to bearing failure and customer dissatisfaction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Early milestone&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Early versions of the equipment were introduced into production line testing, but the group continued to probe further until, in 1965, one member of the group, E. Yhland, reached a milestone in the understanding of the quasi-static problem of bearing vibration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His work became a contribution to establishing national standards such as AFBMA 13-1987 and DIN 5426 (draft). These standards define and specify the physical quantities to be measured and the test conditions to be applied. The equipment became of extreme importance for high-quality bearing production.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today, SKF equipment such as the MVH vibration tester is used to analyze precisely the structure-borne noise and vibration of deep-groove ball bearings, angular contact ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical roller bearings. The MVH is also used as the SKF reference equipment for these measurements.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Operation of the MVH 90C/200C vibration tester is semi-automatic, so when a bearing is to be tested, the only things to be done by hand are: the loading of the bearing on the test spindle; the pressing of the two-handed start; and removal of the bearing after the test.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The extremely precise sliding bearing spindle drives the inner ring of the bearing at a constant set speed while loading is provided by an adjustable, pneumatic axial loading unit. When the automatic test cycle begins, the axial loading unit applies an axial load to the outer ring and moves the bearing against the testing spindle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A pickup is applied to the stationary outer ring of the bearing and any bearing noise is measured, analyzed and displayed. After a predetermined time, the axial loading unit returns to its rest position and the machine is ready for the next test cycle. Resetting for another type of bearing can be done quickly and simply.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tip of the pickup rests against the outer ring and converts the radial vibration of the bearing into an electrical signal that is proportional to the velocity of the pickup tip. When the signal is amplified and analyzed, the vibration level is measured in three frequency bands. The result identifies one or more of a possible number of defect types as well as detecting dirt particles, cage noise and form deviations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reducing costs and ensuring reliability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The great success of vibration measuring equipment in bearing refurbishment for the aerospace industry has lead to increasing interest from other areas of industry. There is also increasing awareness of the savings to be made from the reuse of bearings that have been tested and meet quality and reliability standards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other examples of the vibration testerâs versatility are its use in manufacturing companies where the equipment can be used to inspect incoming components, and its use in research departments to support R&amp;amp;D activities or act as a test rig for gears, motors or steering units, etc. The equipment is equally useful for grease noise testing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continued development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although the bearing vibration analyzer has come a long way since the 1950s, its development continues at SKF, where the search is on for even more accurate measurements and analysis. At the present time, research is focusing on three interesting areas: the application of different sensor technologies; the use of a detailed noise map; and the introduction of an expert system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information on SKF vibration analyzers, visit &lt;A href="http://www.skf.com"&gt;www.skf.com&lt;/A&gt; . &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/GVQB1yAScjY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Redefining bearing failure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All too often in my consulting work, I&amp;#39;m faced with people who state, &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have many (any) lubrication-related failures.&amp;quot; Probing deeper, I usually ask something like, &amp;quot;So, you&amp;#39;ve never replaced a bearing since the plant was built in 1965?&amp;quot; Of course, the response is invariably, &amp;quot;No, we do replace bearings when they wear out, but our vibration analysis or oil analysis typically finds the problem before the bearing fails.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implicit in this statement is an often widely held belief that for a problem to be considered a &amp;quot;lubrication failure&amp;quot;, the machine must have catastrophically failed, causing untold hours of downtime, and have been directly related to either a lack of lubrication or the use of the wrong lubricant. In my opinion, this is much too narrow a focus and fails to recognize all the other ways in which a plant&amp;#39;s lubrication practices impact cost and mechanical reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By way of illustration, consider the life of a rolling element bearing. Historically, the life expectancy of rolling element bearings has been given by the bearing&amp;#39;s L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life. This rating is calculated based on the load and speed a specific bearing is expected to support; it represents on a probabilistic basis how long the bearing should last before a fatigue failure occurs, with a probability of success of 90 percent. Put another way, for a population of 100 identical bearings with a specific L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life, we might expect 90 of those 100 bearings to still be operating when the L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life period has been reached. Common L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; lives might be anywhere from 80,000 to 200,000 hours (or more), depending on application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In practical applications, a bearing&amp;#39;s L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life is usually multiplied by three adjustment factors, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, such that the anticipated life of a bearing can be stated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adjusted bearing life = a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; x a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; x L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The factor a1 is very simple. It is nothing more than an adjustment of the L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life, depending on the reliability requirements of the system. For example, taking the L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life as the baseline (i.e. a1 = 1.0), to calculate the L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; life (i.e. a 99 percent probability of success, or just a 1 percent probability of failure), we would use an a1 factor of 0.21. Put another way, for us to have a 99 percent probability that a bearing won&amp;#39;t fail within a certain time period, we&amp;#39;d have to reduce the life expectancy to just 21 percent of the calculated L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life. The chart below shows commonly used reliability-based adjustment factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; factor is based on the material used to fabricate the bearing and the finishing that has been applied. For example, if we used a material or finishing process that resulted in a bearing that&amp;#39;s less prone to fatigue failure, the a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be greater than 1, indicating that the bearing might be expected to last longer than the simple L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But from a lubrication perspective, it is the third factor, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, that is of most interest. The a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; factor takes into account the effectiveness of the lubricant in preventing premature bearing wear. Perhaps the most important component of a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio of the actual viscosity of the oil or grease under operating conditions (pressure and temperature) to the minimum calculated viscosity required to create full film separation of the bearing surfaces. This ratio is often referred to as the &amp;quot;Kappa value&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s acknowledged that Kappa values in the 2 to 4 range are required for optimum bearing life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my experience, the most common lubrication problem in rolling element bearings (particularly grease-lubricated bearings) is an inability to appropriately select the correct base oil viscosity of the lubricant in order to preserve an operating Kappa value in the 2 to 4 range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bearing manufacturers include another correction factor as part of a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, specifically related to cleanliness. While cleanliness is less of a factor for bearings protected by a full film (Kappa values in excess of 4), for bearings with less of a film thickness and/or greater stress, the effects of contaminants can greatly impact the ability of a bearing to near its L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life. In some systems, life adjustment factors as high as 3 to 5 can be expected, indicating that with clean systems, we might expect that the bearing might last three to five times the anticipated L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; life simply be keeping the lubricant clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, whenever you replace a bearing, even if the problem didn&amp;#39;t result in any downtime, ask yourself, &amp;quot;Did the bearing last the longest time possible, or could we have done better in extending its life?&amp;quot; Bearings and the labor required to replace them aren&amp;#39;t free!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New gearboxes, bearings lift uptime at aggregates quarry</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Conveyor uptime has increased dramatically at Corcoran Concreteâs quarry in County Mayo in Ireland following a switch to Dodge brand gearboxes and bearings from Baldor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The decision was made following trials on conveyors in the sand production area of the quarry. Here, bearings were failing as often as three times a year, and the gearboxes typically lasted only 12 months. In some cases, a bearing failure also meant changing the gearbox as well, as it had to be removed by force â sustaining damage in the process. In these cases, the material costs were dwarfed by the dayâs downtime needed for the repair. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Corcoran Concrete discussed the problem with local power transmission distributor Central Bearing Supplies, who suggested replacing the Plummer block bearings that came with the original conveyor equipment with Dodge ISN components. The main feature of interest was the ISN bearingâs combined triple-lip and flinger sealing system, which is very effective against contaminants such as sand and stone dust. A further advantage of the bearing is its provision as a shaft-ready bearing with an adapter mounting system that allows installation in typically 15 minutes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=263 alt=http://www.wordsun.com/assets/baldor-2-1226489403.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_corcoran_clip_image002.jpg" width=464&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;When Corcoran Concrete decided to invest in a new stone chip plant, they specified that the conveyors must come fitted with Dodge ISN bearings and Torque-Arm II speed reducers.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As bearing failures occurred in the sand production and washing plant, Corcoran Concrete replaced them with ISN types, and saw reliability increase by around three-fold. When a gearbox also went down, Central Bearing Supplies suggested that it try a Dodge Torque-Arm II shaft-mounted speed reducer, primarily because of its tapered bushing system, which makes disassembly and reassembly a quick and predictable task.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reliability improved again. So, when Corcoran Concrete recently decided to invest in a new 300-tons-per-hour plant for stone chip production, the company specified that the conveyors must come fitted with Dodge ISN bearings and Torque-Arm II speed reducers. The new plant uses Trio aggregate machinery, which is integrated together with custom structures and conveyor sections designed and manufactured by Gortavoy Plant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Corcoran Concrete maintenance manager Ian Duffy stated: "This is a competitive business and reliability of production is a critical concern â to make sure our clients' construction projects run smoothly. The sealing integrity built into these Dodge parts has made a significant difference for us. And when parts do eventually fail, we have the fallback position of predictable repair times through designed-for-maintainability features."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A further spin-off benefit for Corcoran Concrete is the Torque-Arm II speed reducerâs use of two-stage helical gearing. This provides outstanding energy efficiency in the 96 percent range, minimizing energy consumption. The difference became clear when Duffy decided to make a comparison between old and new conveyors using an ammeter. Drives on the older conveyor systems tend to draw currents of around 70 to 75 amperes (A). The new conveyors in the stone chip area with their Dodge helical gearboxes draw around 40A. Although this evaluation exercise was not performed under closely controlled conditions, the obvious efficiency of the new automation made it clear that the energy savings would give a fast payback on the investment. These benefits are further amplified for Corcoran Concrete because it already draws almost the maximum capacity of the electricity supply to the quarry, and extending this would incur a substantial charge to improve the infrastructure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Dodge bearings and gearboxes have a formidable durability record on the most aggressive processes," says Mike McGrath of Central Bearing Supplies. "Compared with the components often fitted on quarry conveyors, they can often increase operating lifetimes substantially as this quarry application demonstrates."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The handling automation for the new stone processing area has been designed by Gortavoy Plant, a Northern Ireland company specializing in application-specific automation solutions for quarries. To aid the reliability and maintainability of the 17-section conveyor system it produced for Corcoran Concrete, just two sizes of Dodge gearbox and two sizes of ISN bearing have been used throughout the conveyor system, by allowing for good margins of performance above the nominal ratings. This feature aids the robustness of the system, and additionally allows Corcoran Concrete to maintain a spares holding on the site to deal quickly with any unforeseeable problems. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>SKF unveils two energy-efficient bearing types</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 16.8pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-themecolor: text1"&gt;SKF CEO and president Tom Johnstone announced that spherical and cylindrical roller bearings have been developed which meet the stringent SKF energy-efficient performance-class criteria. Extensive testing results verify significant friction reduction compared to SKF standard bearings. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 16.8pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-themecolor: text1"&gt;SKF energy efficient spherical roller bearings exhibit at least 30 percent less friction and corresponding reduced energy consumption, considerably lower bearing temperature, extended grease life and extended relubrication intervals. Five sizes of open bearings are the first to be introduced for industrial ventilation fan applications as part of the total SKF energy efficient solution for fans. Additional sizes will be offered based on customer demand. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 16.8pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-themecolor: text1"&gt;The first SKF energy-efficient cylindrical roller bearings to be introduced are of the NJ series, which are designed to handle axial loads in one direction. Compared to the current SKF standard NJ series bearing, the new SKF energy efficient cylindrical roller bearings exhibit a friction reduction of at least 30 percent in axial loaded applications and have a higher dynamic load rating. These new ultra-low friction bearings are intended for a wide range of applications, initially for industrial and wind energy transmissions. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 16.8pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-themecolor: text1"&gt;The SKF energy efficient spherical and cylindrical roller bearings are the latest in the companyâs energy efficient performance class of rolling bearings. Manufacturing will be initiated during the second quarter 2009. Last year in connection with the 100-year anniversary of SKF, the company introduced the energy-efficient single-row deep-groove ball bearing and the energy efficient tapered roller bearing. The ranges in these two bearing types continue to expand as customer demand is increasing. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-themecolor: text1"&gt;Johnstone noted, âWe will continue to develop our energy efficient range of bearings as it is fundamental to our commitment to develop integrated energy-efficient solutions based on our engineering knowledge in our five platforms.â &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/xiTGAb4U7J8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>A primer on self-lubricating bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;These days, maintenance departments do not need to spend time and money lubricating bearings on the plant floor. Bearing lubrication technology has overtaken traditionally accepted procedures still practiced in many industrial facilities. Self-lubricating plain bearings offer plant-floor decision-makers maintenance-free options to maximize productivity and minimize costs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are three types of self-lubricating plain bearings used today. Oil-filled sintered bronze bearings were first conceived in the 1930s, with self-lubricating metal-polymer bearings developed around 1950 and lubrication-free solid polymer bearings appearing in the 1960s. Wear rate and operation under specific loads, temperatures and speeds are all important considerations when selecting the best bearing for your application. The effects of dust, dirt or chemicals on the bearing are also often decisive factors, as well as noise levels and performance alongside different shaft materials. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Bearings--Fig-1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200807_Applied_Reli_Bearings--Fig-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. The benefits of solid polymer bearings include resistance to dirt and impact. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Oil-impregnated, sintered bronze bearings rely on a capillary action to create a lubricating oil film. Benefits include a low coefficient of friction, high precision and rotational speeds up to 1,200 surface feet per minute (sfm). Critically, however, high speed and rotational motion are both required to draw the oil out and maintain a full film of lubricant. Shaft oscillation, slow speed and intermittent use can all inhibit this process. If movement stops, the oil on the surface of the bearing dries up; this can lead to squeaking and an increase in the coefficient of friction. In addition, high temperatures can break down the oil. Further disadvantages with this type of bearing include low chemical resistance and sensitivity to dirt, edge pressure and impacts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Metal-polymer solutions consist of a metal backing and a thin polymer (such as PTFE) liner. This plastic liner contains a solid lubricant which is displaced from the bearing onto the shaft during movement. The advantages conferred by this self-lubricating layer include a low coefficient of friction and high load capacity â up to 36,260 pounds per square inch (psi) compared to the 1,450 psi achievable with sintered bronze bearings. The bearings are also suitable for high temperatures. However, they are very sensitive to dirt, susceptible to corrosion and do not readily absorb vibrations. The polymer liner can't withstand high edge loads or oscillating movements and is gradually stripped off. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The third, lubrication-free option is to use injection-molded solid polymer bearings. These bearings are made with a mixture of thermoplastic materials, embedded reinforcing fibers and solid lubricant. The fiber-reinforced materials maintain the bearing's strength and resistance to high forces and edge loads. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Bearings--Fig-2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200807_Applied_Reli_Bearings--Fig-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. This split image compares a bronze and a polymer bearing. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Self-lubricating plastic plain bearings offer technical advantages in comparison to metal or metal-backed bearings. A low wear rate, superior chemical resistance and low noise are a few examples. Solid polymer bearings are also impervious to corrosion and have a high load capacity. They are usually underestimated at high temperatures because they are made from plastic, yet short-term temperatures greater than 572 degrees Fahrenheit and long-term temperatures of 482 F are possible. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The dry-running nature of these bearings means dirt particles do not stick to the surface, but instead deflect off it. For this reason, optimal performance can be maintained even in extremely dirty environments. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After the plain bearing itself, the shaft is the most important parameter for a bearing system. This is because it is in direct contact with the bearing and is affected by relative motion. The shaft surface is critical due to the fact a shaft that is too rough acts like a file and, during movement, separates small particles from the bearing surface. On the other hand, shafts that are too smooth can lead to higher wear because not enough lubricant can be transferred onto the shaft to have an effect. Sintered bronze bearings function best on very hard, expensive precision-ground shafts. In contrast, solid polymer bearings have the ability to run on all types of shafts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, a predictable wear rate is extremely desirable for maintenance professionals. Users should choose a bearings manufacturer with the ability to accurately calculate bushing lifetime in a specific application based on an extensive tribological test database. Currently, this technology is only available with injection-molded, self-lubricating polymer bearings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One fork truck application has had the latter integrated into its gearshift lever. The plastic bearings withstand 30-pound loads, oscillating movements, 10 cycles per minute and ambient temperatures up to 170 F. They are quieter and cheaper than sintered bronze alternatives and suffer minimal wear. They are also vibration dampening, easy to install and impervious to dirt. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In another application, a swinging hinge assembly used to support PVC swinging strip doors â used for quick loading bay access â has been using maintenance-free, all-plastic plain bearings since 1998 with no problems. The bearings are resistant to shocks and edge loads. They replaced expensive and corrosion-prone needle bearings and steel washers.

            <title>How many lubrication technicians does it take to grease a bearing?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One question I commonly get during Noria training classes is: &amp;quot;Our plant has X number of machines. How many lube techs do we need to do a proper job of lubricating them?&amp;quot; While the question may seem simple, the answer is not. You see, it depends on a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First and foremost, we must consider physical plant layout. While it may be easy for one technician to maintain 500-plus machines that are laid out in a linear fashion on a single floor, many sites - particularly older plants where expansion has forced machines into every nook and cranny - take more time for even the most experienced tech to navigate, particularly where stairs are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, we must consider machine complexity. If most of the assets are simple machine trains (e.g. electric motor, coupling, pump), the number and complexity of lubrication tasks are fairly simple. But, if the machines have multiple oil or grease points in hard-to-reach places, each machine could take a considerable amount of time to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, we need to consider accessibility. If each lube point is easy to access under normal operating conditions, the act of lubricating the machines becomes simple. However, if there are accessibility issues requiring partial disassembly of covers or guards, the time to get to the lube point may exceed the time required to perform the task. In fact, if for safety reasons the task can&amp;#39;t be performed without full lockout/tagout, you can opt to make minor modifications in order to turn a downtime task into a runtime task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another consideration is the degree to which automation is included in basic machine relubrication. While single- or multi-point lube systems must still be periodically checked and can&amp;#39;t be considered as &amp;quot;set it and forget it&amp;quot; add-ons, their use, particularly for hard-to-access lube points, can be a major time-saver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, we must look at the degree to which condition-based lubrication tasks have been assigned. While tasks such as regreasing motor bearings or changing oil in a process pump are relatively quick and simple, multiplied across multiple plant assets, the time requirements can be significant. Where feasible, convert routine preventive (time-based) tasks to condition-based tasks driven not by the calendar or hour meter but by feedback data from simple inspection or more sophisticated predictive tools (oil analysis, vibration analysis or ultrasonic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, how do you determine the correct staffing levels for lubrication? First, take a look at what work is currently being done in order to rationalize the lube PM list. Studies show that up to 50 percent of all PM tasks either provide no value or are themselves detrimental to the machines. In optimizing lube PMs, consider eliminating as many time-based PMs as possible in favor of condition-based tasks. Also, look at machine design and configuration to determine if downtime tasks can become runtime tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you rationalize the list of lube PMs, the next step is to organize the required tasks into routes that are ordered and scheduled in the most efficient, logical manor. This is where many companies miss the mark. While it may seem logical to group like tasks into one lube route (e.g. electric motor regreasing), this can create some real inefficiencies as techs visit the same often-remote location several times a day - perhaps first to grease the motor bearing, then to take an oil sample from the gearbox sitting beside the motor, and finally to grease the pillow block bearings coupled to the gearbox. Instead of grouping tasks based on task type, try to issue work plans and routes based on geographic location to minimize travel time and optimize efficiency. In doing so, routes should include the automatic creation of required &amp;quot;tools&amp;quot; (grease gun with product X, oil sampling kits, etc.) so that kitting for the route becomes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, associate a time stamp with each task or route. For example, imagine a route with 50 tasks; each task should take six minutes to complete. Factoring in 60 minutes for kitting and travel time, the full route should take six hours, or 75 percent of a man-day (assuming an eight-hour shift). Once each route or task type has been time-stamped, it&amp;#39;s a straightforward job to convert the total required time to a total required full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount for lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But wait, you say! What about TPM and operator-assisted lubrication? Whether or not your company subscribes to lean principles, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a factor. There are a finite number of tasks that must be performed, and each task takes a finite number of hours/minutes to complete. So, whether the work is being done by dedicated lube techs, mechanics who are part-time lubricators, or operators, the total number of FTEs required to lube the plant is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New bearings for faster paper machines</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Advances in machine technology have made it possible to run equipment faster than ever before. The Pulp &amp;amp; Paper industry is one that has seen speeds increase with each new major design. Unfortunately, the same increased speeds often contribute to higher vibration levels, which can cause shaft and bearing damage and jeopardize the quality of the output. So, the potential for increased production is diminished because the equipment must be kept running and the high cost of maintenance minimized. One paper mill, however, recently installed SKFâs CARB toroidal roller bearing, resulting in a 663 percent return on investment through reduced downtime and increased productivity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In past decades, rocker housings were a solution. These housings are designed to move with the shaft to accommodate thermal expansion in the shaft. However, the increased running speeds possible today result in vibration levels so high that they can cause wear on the rockers. In some cases, vibration causes the housing to jump off the rockers, stopping the machine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At one paper mill where machine capabilities offered the potential for gains in productivity, the high speeds needed to reach the production goals caused similarly high vibration levels. To prevent vibration-related bearing damage and downtime, it was necessary to reduce speeds by 4 percent, from 750 meters per minute to 720 meters per minute, a slowdown that decreased production by 4,000 tons annually.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the existing arrangement, the bearings and housing were equipped with a conventional self-aligning bearing assembly and rocker housing, both designed to accommodate shaft elongation. Even so, the bearings and housing could not accommodate the significant changes in shaft behavior caused by increasingly higher machine speeds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An SKF paper specialist recommended rebuilding the housing to incorporate an SKF CARB toroidal roller bearing to accommodate misalignment and axial displacement within the bearing. The CARB toroidal roller bearing was developed to accommodate linear expansion within the bearing, up to 10 percent of the bearing width, as well as misalignment. This means the bearing can be mounted with a tight fit in the housing as well as on the shaft.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The rocker housing was also modified so that it could be fixed to the frame of the machine to reduce cylinder vibration levels and improve paper quality. Typical benefits of the CARB arrangement include: increased speeds, higher reliability, maximization of bearing life, reduced downtime, reduced vibration and accommodation of thermal expansion within the system â virtually without friction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ROI details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Saving per machine by avoiding speed loss: â¬528,000 ($ 769,211)&lt;BR&gt;SKF rocker housing rebuild and CARB bearing investment: -â¬72,000 ($ 104,916)&lt;BR&gt;Total savings: â¬456,000 ($ 664,295)&lt;BR&gt;Total ROI: 633 percent&lt;BR&gt;(All figures are rounded and based on customerâs estimates of labor and production costs.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other pulp and paper mill applications that might benefit from rocker housing rebuilds with CARB bearings include: all types of paper and board machines, coaters, dryer cylinders and Yankee/MG cylinders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information, visit &lt;A href="http://www.skf.com/"&gt;www.skf.com&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/qBSZbvgXPwU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bearing manufacturer makes a haunting impression</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;For most people, Halloween comes only once a year, but for Scareparts, a leading manufacturer of animated props, Halloween is an everyday affair. The company has carved itself a unique niche in the entertainment and amusement industries by focusing on the creation of animated props designed to frighten, scare and spook viewers. To ensure the reliability and longevity of its characters, Scareparts uses iglide plain and igubal spherical high-performance plastic bearings from igus Inc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Scareparts offers a wide array of terrifying props that crawl, jump and grab, including the Jester, a full-size skeleton action figure; Sluggo, the half body of a man with exposed mettle; and Resurrection, which features skeleton figures lunging at patrons from beyond the grave. Each Scareparts character uses as many as 20 igus bearings to enable rotating and oscillating movements on various parts, which range from bloody pop-out pieces to gruesome, grabbing hands to swing-open coffin doors. Igus bearings are used on every line of animated characters, including those designed to be quick and easy for at-home Halloween displays. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf the piece has movement, it uses igus bearings,â said Keith Korner, president of Scareparts. âIn 2003, we replaced oil-impregnated bearings with igus plastic bearings and we have seen benefits from the switch ever since.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Scareparts uses iglide J and iglide M250 bearings, both of which are made of plastic and therefore lubrication- and maintenance-free. Scareparts especially enjoys the versatility of iglide bearings. Unlike metal or bronze bearings, iglide will not corrode or fail as a result of varying temperatures or conditions and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Iglide bearings can withstand the severe weather, dirt, mud and extremely humid environments to which many Scareparts characters are exposed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have seen a competitorâs product fail in one season, which is only 15 to 16 days,â said Korner. âWith iglide bearings, our products last indefinitely.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to iglide, Scareparts also uses igubal spherical flange, pillow block and rod-end bearings. Igubal bearings are self-aligning, easy to install and have reduced manufacturing costs for Scareparts. Igubal eliminated the need for custom-made housings, as the bearings simply bolt into place. This saves Scareparts both time and money. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Aside from the financial advantages, igus products also boast a number of additional benefits. By using the lightweight plastic bearings, Scareparts was able to reduce the weight of its characters. Igus components also are aesthetically pleasing and do not detract from the overall look of the props. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe started using igus bearings because of the tremendous value they offer us,â said Korner. âThey are durable, lightweight, reliable and easy to maintain. Not to mention, they look cool.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Scareparts focuses on sales and production from March through September, dedicating the remainder of the year to prototyping new products. The company is constantly working on new characters and ideas, most of which incorporate igus components.

            <title>Timken to expand its industrial bearing services </title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The Timken Company on October 17 announced the expansion of its industrial bearing services capacity in response to the strong long-term outlook for demand and to extend the company&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa4&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s heavy-industrial customer base. Timken will invest nearly $6 million in this project, which includes the opening of a new service center in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Union&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;S.C.&lt;/st1:State&gt;, and the expansion of the company&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa5&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s existing industrial bearing services facility in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;South Bend&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Ind.&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;This investment will enable Timken&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa6&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Indiana&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; facility to respond more quickly to customer needs. The &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; service location, which is currently housed within a Timken bearing manufacturing plant, will relocate to a facility solely dedicated to providing industrial bearing services. The new center will open in mid-year 2008. When it is fully operational in early 2009, the new center will have additional capacity to remanufacture bearing types and brands within the 18- to 51-inch size range. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa7&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;This investment supports Timken&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa8&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s global services strategy of providing integrated maintenance services for our customers&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa9&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; power transmission systems,&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa10&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; said Joseph W. Wonsettler, global operations manager for industrial services. &lt;SPAN id=bwanpa11&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;This expansion will allow us to increase bearing repair capacity and improve on-time delivery requirements for customers.&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa12&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Through its industrial bearing services, Timken provides customers with an integrated maintenance program that covers the total lifecycle of bearings. Services include mill maintenance management programs, bearing remanufacturing, chock bearing maintenance and roll and chock repair. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In addition to &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/st1:State&gt; and &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Indiana&lt;/st1:State&gt;, Timken operates bearing repair centers in &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;Brazil&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;South Africa&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;China&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;Romania&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; and &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;France&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;.

            <title>Proper lubing keeps bearings rolling</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the Reliability Forum department of &lt;I&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/I&gt; magazine, companies provide their insights to a question posed by editor Paul V. Arnold. This issue, the call went out to manufacturers of bearings. These companies were asked: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;"In your opinion, what are the most common mistakes end-users make when lubricating bearings?"&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The best response was provided by David A. Pierman, the product manager of industrial lubricants and delivery devices at the Timken Company. His reply follows. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"There are three lubrication mistakes that we see time and time again: not enough lubrication, too much lubrication, and the wrong type or grade of lubrication. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Forum-Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Forum-Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Inadequate lubrication led to a total bearing lock-up. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Insufficient grease lubrication commonly occurs when grease is improperly packed and does not get between the rollers, or when too little is added to properly fill the housing. With oil lubricants, a shortage is common when failing to fill to the required level that would allow the bearing to dip into the oil. Either condition can lead to lubricant starvation and subsequent bearing damage due by overheating from roller scoring. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Forum-Figure2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Forum-Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Inadequate lubrication led to cone large rib face deformation. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"When too much lubricant is used, especially in higher-speed applications, the excessive churning of the lube can generate as much heat as not having enough. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Finally, using the wrong type or grade of lubricant could result in early fatigue, damage or even burn-ups. Too light of a viscosity could result in a thin film, and too high of a viscosity can lead to elevated temperatures, degrading the lubricant, reducing fatigue life and leading to other potential bearing or application problems. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Timken bearings equip Arcelor Mittal steel mill in Poland</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The Timken Company announced August 9 that it is the exclusive supplier of tapered, spherical and cylindrical roller bearings for Arcelor Mittal's new high-capacity hot-strip steel rolling mill in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Krakow&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;Poland&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;. Timken received the $2 million contract from Siemens Metals Technologies, which is building the mill.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Timken bearings have been installed in various locations throughout the mill including the roll stands that shape the steel, cutting sheers and the power coilers that wind the finished steel sheets onto a roll and other equipment. The mill is scheduled to be commissioned later this quarter.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"Steel mill builders turn to us because we not only deliver product that improves a mill's performance," said Michael J. Connors, Timken's vice president of industrial equipment, "but also because we work closely with builders to bring our first-hand knowledge of rolling-mill manufacturing to the design and selection of the bearing products for such a mill."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;With a steel strip width of up to 2,100 millimeters, or 84 inches, the mill produces some of the widest finished products in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/st1:place&gt; for carbon, stainless and special-steel grades to meet the higher quality needs of the automotive, petroleum and fuel industries. The new mill will also significantly reduce operating costs for Arcelor Mittal, while producing 2.4 million tons of steel annually, which is approximately 20 percent of total steel production in &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Poland&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;London-based Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steelmaker, invested around 300 million euros, or about $400 million USD, in construction of the &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Krakow&lt;/st1:place&gt; mill. Constructed as part of a comprehensive modernization program, the mill is the first hot-rolled facility to be built in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/st1:place&gt; in 10 years.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/BlJ6dogzg0Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF acquires leading maker of magnetic bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;SKF has signed an agreement with the British company Edwards Limited to acquire its subsidiary S2M, the worldâs leading company in magnetic bearings. SKF had previously held 12 percent of the share capital in S2M. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;S2M has annual sales of Euro 40 million and 200 employees. The company is headquartered in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Vernon&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;France&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, where it also has its manufacturing facilities. SKF pays approximately Euro 55 million for the shares. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;S2M has historically mainly been focusing on the European market. Main end-customer segments are vacuum pumps, small air and gas compressors, turbo expanders and compressors mainly for oil and gas industry. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âThis is a very interesting and fast-developing technology that during the last years has grown out of its development phase and now is considered a reliable alternative for some growing applications areas,â says Tom Johnstone, president and CEO of SKF. âWe are now moving into the technologies of tomorrow, and that is very exciting. The acquisition of S2M is also very complementary both geographically and from a product range point of view for SKF. For many years, SKF has been shareholders in S2M, and the group also has a company in &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Canada&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; (Revolve Inc.) that manufactures magnetic bearings. With this acquisition, the range of magnetic bearings is broadened and the magnetic bearing business is also complementary to the SKF rolling bearing product range.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;S2M will be part of SKFâs Industrial Division. The acquisition is subject to approval by relevant authorities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/HHi97qXA13s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Timken inks bearing, maintenance pacts with India steelmaker</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The Timken Company will supply JSW Steel Ltd. of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; with bearings for its new cold-rolling steel mill as well as provide its MILLTEC rolling mill maintenance services after construction is completed. The two new contracts for bearings and services are valued at approximately $1.2 million. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;JSW is adding the steel mill as part of its plans to increase annual production from a current 3.8 million tons to 30 million tons by 2010. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"JSW Steel has become an important Indian manufacturer and a valued customer for Timken as we continue to grow our business along with &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;'s dynamic market," said David White, Timken's director of sales and marketing in &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;. "Timken customers around the world have long valued the engineering expertise and technical know-how that goes into our products. Now we are using that same expertise to provide complete solutions like our MILLTEC rolling mill maintenance services. Offering such services is one way we add value for our customers here in &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; and around the world.â &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Timken first began working with JSW Steel in 2000 as a bearing supplier for its hot-strip mill at the Vijaynagar complex. In 2004, Timken began offering its customized MILLTEC services, which included responsibility for managing the roll-shop operation. Timken associates work on-site, applying the company's knowledge of friction management to increase operating efficiency. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;When MILLTEC services first began at JSW, the hot-strip mill was experiencing significant bearing failures. The Timken team quickly worked with JSW on those problems to help improve productivity. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"Timken proved the value of its MILLTEC team, which identified the problem, suggested solutions and implemented a plan of corrective action," White said. "Our success to date shows that Timken is a key supplier that JSW can look to for all future projects."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/AeMvdrDsuPI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Timken seeks energy efficiency in bearing applications</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=style1 align=left&gt;The Timken Company, a 107-year-old global maker of highly engineered bearings and alloy steel headquartered in Canton, Ohio, is making great strides to develop new energy-efficient applications for its bearings. One of the solutions: harness the wind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whenever something is moved, it requires energy â whether it is a personâs own physical exertion or energy that is generated from a machine. If a machine is being used to move something, chances are it contains an anti-friction bearing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When two or more components come in contact with each other, the friction between them causes a force that slows them down, also slowing down the main object being moved, like a bicycle or a car.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That friction requires more energy to be consumed. But, if the two surfaces can roll over each other, the friction is greatly reduced, and the amount of energy required to move an object is also reduced.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Timken Company is using its extensive knowledge of friction and power transmission to help leading U.S. and European wind turbine manufacturers and gearbox suppliers create new energy-efficient designs to improve the reliability and efficiency of wind power. Bearing and bearing packages are used in the gearbox and main motor support of wind turbines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Timkenâs anti-friction bearings do just that â reduce friction. And anytime friction is reduced, energy is conserved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/ThdP2074Hog" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Handling has bearing on performance</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;Proper handling techniques are a necessity in order to maximize bearing life and performance. From shipping and receiving to unpacking, installing, disassembling and rebuilding, a bearing is exposed to a great deal of handling. Done incorrectly at any stage, this handling may reduce the life of the bearing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But, fear not. By understanding and following proper techniques, you can reduce bearing damage and downtime, and see significant productivity gains. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;COMMON MISTAKES &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Incorrect bearing handling often occurs during installation. To avoid such mistakes, it's important to closely follow the bearing manufacturer's instructions and recommendations. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The most common installation mistakes are improper bearing setting and adjustment. Set or adjusted incorrectly, the bearing is at risk for conditions such as misalignment, nicking or spalling, all of which may lead to premature failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Applied_Reli_Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bearing is a hard-working machine component, but that doesn't mean it is indestructible. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Besides the initial installation, consult manuals provided by the original equipment manufacturer for proper techniques and procedures when rebuilding equipment. During a rebuild, the entire system must be properly cleaned and relubricated to ensure the system is free of any damaging debris or particles. If not cleaned properly, replacement bearings and components still may be at risk for damage because the contamination might remain in the system. When the system is properly cleaned, it's equally important to handle replacement bearings and components in a clean environment so dirt or contamination isn't transferred into the system during the rebuilding process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Other common mistakes that can diminish bearing life include denting the cup during installation and not pressing the cup correctly. In addition to carefully handling the bearing itself, remember that the bearing is affected by its surrounding components such as lubricants and seals. Carefully inspecting these elements will help you improve the overall performance of the bearing system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;PROPER SOLUTIONS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Following some proper handling tips will increase your odds of prolonged bearing life. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, ensure that the work area is clean and free of debris. Clean out the machine or equipment with a clean rag and gloves. Remember, solvents sometimes can help to loosen any hardened grease, and air hoses can clean out air holes or castings. Although an excellent method to clean out a bearing, if using an air hose, be sure to use proper safety equipment and do not blow any debris into or onto the clean work area. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lastly, before final installation, check the seals and use an application-appropriate lubricant to gain additional security and better system performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;HELPFUL TOOLS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beyond these general handling tips and guidelines, the next step is selecting the right tools for the job. As with any tools, it's important to use proper safety techniques and the recommended safety equipment. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Induction heaters:&lt;/B&gt; Induction heating is a superior, fast, clean and controlled heating method for bearings, gears and other products requiring a press fit. It is a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional heating methods such as oil baths or blow torches. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Heating the bearing with an induction heater increases the diameter of the bearing slightly to allow easy placement over a shaft. This tool eliminates any damage to (or debris from) the bearing when moving over the shaft. If you try to place an unheated bearing over the shaft, microscopic particles may break off and get into the machine, causing premature bearing and component damage. Once the bearing cools down, it grabs the outside diameter (OD) of the shaft, enabling it to have a proper fit so it doesn't move or spin in place. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;TABLE class=sidebar cellPadding=5 align=center&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=sidebarheader&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;BEARING WARNINGS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=sidebar&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Proper bearing maintenance and handling practices are critical. Failure to observe the following warnings could lead to a risk of serious bodily harm. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Never spin a bearing with compressed air. The rollers may be forcefully expelled with great velocity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If a hammer and bar are used for bearing removal, fragments from the hammer, bar or the bearing can be released with high velocity. A mild steel bar is preferred since it is less susceptible to fragmenting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When installing or removing bearings, always wear safety glasses or goggles. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Cleaning solvents may be toxic or flammable. Ensure adequate ventilation and wear protective clothing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Remove oil or rust inhibitor from parts before heating to avoid a fire or fumes. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When using an induction heater, make sure the heater has an automatic demagnetizing feature. An extremely magnetic bearing may collect unwanted debris. Also, use a feeler gauge to ensure the backface of the bearing doesn't move away from the shaft's shoulder. And, do not overheat the bearing since this may damage, soften or misshape the bearing. Temperatures of 200 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit will generally allow it to overcome most fitting conditions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Feeler gauges:&lt;/B&gt; It's difficult for the naked eye to see if the bearing is sitting against the shoulder. Therefore, use feeler gauges to measure thousandths of an inch between the surfaces. This ensures proper seating. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dial indicators:&lt;/B&gt; Use these to check the end play (amount of shaft movement axially, relative to the housing) in tapered roller bearings. To make sure there is proper clearance (end play), follow this procedure: After mounting a dial indicator on the housing with the indicator point on the end of the shaft, move the shaft in one direction axially, while rotating or oscillating. Set the indicator to read "0". Move the shaft in the opposite direction, again while rotating or oscillating. The indicator will read the amount of end play in the system. Each application is unique, so consult your equipment manufacturer for the proper amount of end play for your application. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For spherical, cylindrical and ball bearings, clearance is measured in a radial direction and is affected by the class of bearing ordered and the fits. Check critical applications by feeler gages or dial indicators. It's important to follow the design engineers' requirements when installing all bearing types. Bearing manufacturers offer classroom and hands-on training in all of these methods, as well as on aspects of bearing maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Bearing or gear pullers:&lt;/B&gt; If planning to reuse a bearing or gear, pullers are a useful tool for removing them safely and properly. Compare the "reach" and "spread" of the puller with the product to be removed and select a puller with dimensions larger than those of the job. Make sure the jaws don't interfere with the free movement of the cage. A very common mistake is to attach the jaws to the cage and begin the pulling operation. For proper removal, the jaws must engage the bearing's backface. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;BEARINGS BENEFIT &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you properly handle bearings, you greatly minimize damage. This ultimately saves your company time and money.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Timken bearings in new Velaro high-speed trains </title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The Timken Company announced April 3 that it is the sole authorized supplier of tapered roller bearings for the axle-riding final drives used to transmit power to the wheels of some of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Europe&lt;/st1:place&gt;âs fastest trains. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The new Siemens Velaro E high-speed train is capable of achieving speeds up to 217 miles per hour on the &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Madrid&lt;/st1:State&gt; to &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/st1:City&gt; route of &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Spain&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;âs national railway. German drive manufacturer Voith Turbo GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG developed the SE-380 final drive for the Velaro E with both performance and passenger comfort in mind. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;On the Velaro E, the drives are located directly below the passenger area. For this reason, noise reduction was a critical design objective. Voith made changes in the gearing and housing design and sought a new bearing concept. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Voith turned to Timken for help in designing a bearing for the output shaft of the drive that would support performance needs while being more compact and economical than the previous cylindrical roller bearing design used on some high-speed trains. Timken engineers designed tapered roller bearings capable of meeting the special design requirements and compatible with the extremely high travel speeds. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âWe applied our knowledge of friction management and power transmission to take a proven bearing design and developed it further to improve the trainâs performance, lowering weight and enhancing the passenger experience by reducing noise," said Mat Happach, Timkenâs vice president for rail. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 12pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Timken has been developing and manufacturing products for the rail industry since the early 1930s.

            <title>How to flush gearboxes and bearing housings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Gearboxes and bearing housings periodically need a thorough flushing rather than a simple drain and fill. Several signs point to this requirement, such as overheating of the sump, gross liquid or solid contamination, and development of a severe wear pattern. Material evidence in the form of sludge, rust, moisture, wear metals, gel or other viscous residue that is present at the beginning of the drain should confirm to the technician that a flush is in order. A thorough flush is also useful for removing construction and assembly contaminants from equipment sumps prior to commissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;With these factors in mind, what constitutes a thorough sump flush? Are there any particular problems that the operator should be careful to avoid? What equipment can or should be used for this purpose? Finally, what items should be included in a detailed flushing procedure? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Flushing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Flushing is a clean fluid circulation process designed to remove water, chemical contaminants, air and particulate matter (not fixed to surface) resulting from construction, normal ingression, internal generation or component wear. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Flushing can be useful in many different circumstances, such as the following: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;For new or rebuilt machines to remove contamination resulting from manufacture, service or overhaul. The fluid system can be contaminated due to dirty assembling elements, corroded surfaces, water, oxidation products and incompatible elastomers such as seals, sealants and coatings. Also, during the assembly process, dirt is ingested and debris is generated due to threading, joining, welding, etc. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;For in-service machinery after an oil change due to heavy fluid contamination, component failure, extremely degraded lubricant (oxidation), or if a system flushing has not been performed in the past three years. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;For gearboxes and bearing housings that are not fitted with filtration, flushing is required to remove contamination and sediment. Water, rust, excessive wear debris, sludge, varnish or lacquer, and hard-to-open drain ports suggest system contamination and indicate the need for a thorough flush. Ten percent of the old contaminated or depleted lubricant may be enough to use up most of the additives of the new oil. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;What Flushing Removes &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Material attached to contact or noncontact surfaces that may be harmful to lubricants or critical working surfaces is generically called soil. Soil may be composed of material that is generated internally, such as varnish, carbon deposits, chemical residues, sludge and rust; or material that is generated externally, such as scale, welding slag, rust, machining swarf and metal debris. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Soils may be mechanically or chemically removed. Flushing is a type of high-pressure, high-flow fluid circulation used to generate physical movement of contaminants. As the pressures/flow is used for flushing, circulating clean fluid in the system cannot clean rust and scale from the piping, deburr machined elements or remove flux or weld slag. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Flushing Methods &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Three levels of system flushing are practiced, depending on the machinery internal conditions and type of contaminants compromising the system. Figure 1 provides a summary of different flushing approaches that may be used and various circumstances and criteria associated with each method. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/Backup_200603_CC-fig1.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img border="1" height="145" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/Backup_200603_CC-fig1-thumb.gif" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recirculation cleaning&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The recirculation of clean fluid at a high velocity to achieve a turbulent flow helps remove contamination from the fluid system. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power flushing&lt;/strong&gt; - A variation of recirculation, where the oil level in the sump is reduced and a high-velocity fluid is applied to mechanically dislodge, lift and entrain particulate debris. Power flushing suspends and transports particles; absorbs air, chemical products and water from the system; and releases the contaminants to a filter. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wand flushing&lt;/strong&gt; - A wand attached to one of the cart hoses is used to discharge at high pressure (kicking up adherent debris). The flow is then reversed and the wand vacuums the sediments. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solvent cleaning&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The use of solvents to remove organic deposits that cannot be removed by recirculation. Solvent cleaning may incorporate the use of organic (hydrocarbon-based) halogenated, nonhalogenated and blends solvents (type A-1 cleaners such as kerosene, or A-2 cleaners such as naphtha and Stoddard solvent are common) to dissolve heavily crusted or layered carbon residues. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Organic solvents tend to be blends of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and dissolve soil as opposed to emulsifying soil. These materials may be warranted if evidence of heavy carbonaceous residue exists. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical cleaning&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The use of chemicals that can dissolve inorganic components. Chemical cleaning may incorporate the use of aqueous alkali or acid solutions to accomplish the desired result. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Regardless of the flushing compound/fluid selected, unless it is identical to the lubricant used following the flush, it is important that all of the flushing fluid be removed from the sump prior to final fill. Some petroleum solvents with a concentration of five percent can create an appreciable thinning effect on the lubricant viscosity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Factors for Effective Flushing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Fluid Properties. Fluid solubility and hygroscopic characteristics influence removal efficiency of water, air and chemical contaminants. Most oil companies supply special flushing fluids (rust-inhibited oils with good solvency power) that demonstrate the following desirable properties: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;compatible with system components and lubricating fluid &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;noncorrosive to machine components &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;low viscosity (lower than the lubricating oil used in the system) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;high density to suspend particles &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;low surface tension to eliminate air &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;high solvency &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;hygroscopicity (for water removal) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;nonflammable &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;economical &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;reclaimable &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Turbulence&lt;/strong&gt;. To remove particles, the flushing process depends on the lift forces, drag forces and the depth of the laminar sublayer in the stagnant fluid next to the conduit wall. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;As seen in Figure 1, turbulence can have a significant influence on loosely attached solid debris lingering in crevices or in the sidewall perimeter low-flow area. Turbulence in the system shortens the time and improves the quality of the flushing activity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;To properly achieve particle removal, the fluid must be turbulent. The indexless Reynolds number measures turbulence. In general, a number greater than 4,000 represents turbulent flow, and a number less than 2,000 represents laminar flow. Hydraulic and circulation system designers strive to create laminar flow conditions. For gearbox and bearing housings fed with a central system, turbulence is necessary. For stand-alone housings, the effect of turbulence and the ability to direct the force of the fluid facilitates movement of soil. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;img height="241" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/Backup_200603_CC-fig2.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;The Reynolds number can be calculated by: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nr = 3160*GPM/CS*D &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Where GPM = flushing fluid flow rate in gallons per minute &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;CS = flushing fluid viscosity &amp;ndash; centistokes at 40&amp;deg;C &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;D = pipe/tube inside diameter &amp;ndash; inches &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;There is some risk associated with the high-velocity flush. Circulation of a fluid at high velocity with particulate contaminants can damage sensitive components (pumps, heat exchangers and valves). Also, such high pressures and flow can affect system filters. It is necessary to bypass flow- or contaminant- sensitive components. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Filter housings can be left in place if filter elements are removed. Components that restrict the flow rate, and thereby increase the pressure drop, should be isolated from the flushing circuit and cleaned individually. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Flushing Equipment &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;The flushing equipment required depends on the size, location and installed devices on the machinery. A mobile filtration unit is helpful if the pumps are capable of providing a flow rate at least twice that normally used in the fluid system or the flow requirements for the proper Reynolds number. An air breather is required to prevent dirt ingression during flushing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Use large duplex filters (Beta 3= 200 or higher) with differential pressure indicator to allow filter changing without interrupting flushing. If water removal is desired, include a filter with water-absorbing capabilities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;A heater should be required in case of low ambient temperature to maintain or reduce fluid viscosity and achieve the flow requirements. Permanently installed quick-connectors are beneficial for flushing or filtration if the connector and piping are large enough to facilitate flow. In some cases, a reservoir other than the machinery sump is needed to contain the high volume of fluid required for the appropriate flushing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;A sampling port should be included upstream of the filter to analyze the fluid to establish when system cleanliness is achieved. An in-line, flow decay-type particle counter is the best option. If particle counters are not available, the use of an optical filter patch can help to determine system cleanliness. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Flushing Procedure &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;The flushing procedure depends on the specifics of machinery, plant conditions and flushing equipment. To obtain the best results, follow these guidelines: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Drain the used oil while hot, so the viscosity is low and contaminants remain suspended and can be drained within the oil. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Inspect the drained oil and drain ports for contamination that may indicate the need for power flushing or wand flushing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;If drain port is not located at the lower point, heavy solid particles, water and/or emulsions will stick to the bottom of the reservoir. Wand flush is required. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Remove oil filters from system. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Block or bypass sensitive components. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Block or bypass components that can reduce fluid velocity. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;If necessary, divide the system in sections. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Connect the flushing equipment to gear box or bearing housing. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Install air breather. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Circulate and heat the fluid if necessary to reduce viscosity and pressure drop. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Flush at specified Reynolds number to achieve turbulent condition. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Monitor the contamination level (in-line particle counter readings or sample fluid and optically inspect filter patch). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Circulate fluid an additional 15 minutes after cleanliness level is achieved. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Drain and blow the system with dry, filtered air. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Remove flushing connectors. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Empty and clean filter housings and install new filter elements. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Refill the system with filtered specified lubricant. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Circulate (filter) new oil at least seven times before operating the equipment. Use a filter cart in systems without filtration. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Label and store flushing fluid. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Analyze flushing fluid for suitability. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"&gt;Flushing Cleanliness Targets &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;For gearboxes and bearings, the target cleanliness level for flushing should be at least one number below the cleanliness level for the operating fluid. A maximum of 16/14/12 (ISO 4406.99) is recommended for critical gearboxes and element bearings. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;The flushing process may be perceived to be an expensive, complicated and time-consuming extra task for an oil change. However, some conditions justify the effort. Highly contaminated reservoirs on critical systems warrant additional attention to assure a high state of reliability.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"&gt;Flushing is justified for new and rebuilt equipment prior to commissioning to sustain high levels of reliability. A proactive maintenance approach of deploying flushing for in-service bearings and gearboxes helps to increase lubricant life and equipment durability. Generally, the flushing efforts and costs are well compensated with increased reliability related to system cleanliness. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken bearings play a key role in mammoth move</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The Timken Company recently played a major role in moving one of the largest loads ever carried by a wheeled vehicle.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Media kit: www.timken.com/media/kits/Scheuerle.asp&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;A fully assembled and equipped oil and gas production facility â weighing 1.5 times the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName w:st="on"&gt;Eiffel&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceType w:st="on"&gt;Tower&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt; or 55 times the Statue of Liberty â was transported by the specialist transport company Abnormal Load Engineering (ALE) of &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;. The facility tipped the scales at 12,430 tons, or 11,300 metric tons.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The transport required the use of hundreds of modular transporters, 224 of which were supplied by Scheuerle. The wheel sets of those transporters were equipped with Timken tapered roller bearings to ensure that the heavy load reached its destination smoothly and reliably.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;"This extremely demanding application has once again demonstrated the value delivered by Timken," said Mike Connors, Timken's vice president for industrial equipment. "With our knowledge of friction management and experience of heavy-load applications, we were able to support Scheuerle in accomplishing this major technical feat and at the same time to cement our relationship with a key customer."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The Timken bearings were manufactured from case-hardened roller bearing steel and matched to this specific transport operation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The facility was moved about five-eighths of a mile (about one kilometer) from its production site to a load-out wharf located in Hartlepool, England, for transfer to a barge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/sxpSrzOZ_dU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>RBC Bearings to build new plant in Connecticut</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;RBC Bearings Incorporated, a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered precision plain, roller and ball bearings for the industrial, defense and aerospace industries, announced on October 24 that the company will begin construction of a new aircraft products facility in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Torrington&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Conn.&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; RBC expects to relocate operations from its current leased facility, also based in Torrington, to the new 137,000-square-foot facility in 2007. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa2&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;The new Torrington facility will play a critical role in helping the company to further execute on operational initiatives and meet the diverse needs of our clients and the growing demand for our products,&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa3&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; said Dr. Michael J. Hartnett, RBCâs chairman and chief executive officer. &lt;SPAN id=bwanpa4&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;Since 2003, we have more than doubled our operations in &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt; from 150 employees to more than 300 employees. We are pleased that our investment in the state will continue and are grateful to both state and local officials for their support.&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa5&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The new facility will allow RBC Bearings to expand current operations and pursue new programs by providing large, open production areas and a stronger infrastructure. CONNSTEP, a state-sponsored agency, is helping the company plan its new plant with the goal of maximizing manufacturing efficiencies. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa6&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a big win for RBC&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa7&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s workers and for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Torrington&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;,&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa8&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; said Congresswoman Nancy Johnson. &lt;SPAN id=bwanpa9&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;This significant new investment in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Torrington&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will boost our local economy and create and retain jobs. I congratulate RBC and its workforce on this good news, and I thank them for their commitment to &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:State&gt;.&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa10&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/g_XULqwc6Tg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Avoid a bearing blunder</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the Reliability Forum department of &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt; magazine, suppliers provide their insights to a question posed by editor Paul V. Arnold. This issue, the call went out to manufacturers of bearings. They were asked: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;âIn your opinion, whatâs the most common mistake end-users make when installing bearings?â&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The best answer came from Thomas T. Mills, the global reliability services manager for the Timken Company. His response follows.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOne of the most common mistakes at installation is improper bearing setting and adjustment. Set or adjusted incorrectly, the bearing is at risk for conditions such as misalignment, nicking or spalling, all of which may lead to premature failure. To avoid such mistakes, it is important to closely follow the instructions and recommendations provided by the bearing manufacturer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=294 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200609_Reli-Forum---Figure-1.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proper setting and adjustment is&lt;BR&gt;needed during installation.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOther common mistakes that can occur during installation and diminish bearing life include denting the cup and not pressing the cup correctly. It is also important to remember that the bearing is affected by its surrounding components, such as lubricants and seals. Thatâs why careful inspection of these elements at the time of installation will help with the overall performance of the bearing system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âAside from the initial installation, it is advised to consult manuals provided by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for proper technique and procedure when rebuilding equipment. During a rebuild, it is critical that the entire system is properly cleaned and relubricated to ensure the system is free of any damaging debris or particles. If not cleaned properly, replacement bearings and components still may be at risk for damage because the contamination might remain in the system. When the system is properly cleaned, it is equally important to be sure to handle replacement bearings and components in a clean environment so dirt or contamination is not transferred into the system during the rebuilding process.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The marriage of bearings, lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Year after year, advancements in equipment and new technologies enable machines to meet the ever-increasing demands of productivity. Although it is not often thought of as part of the equipment, lubrication is an integral component. Lubrication can be a weak link if not given proper thought and attention. Increased knowledge of the invaluable role of lubricants has a significant impact on the life, quality and productivity of a machine. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Significance of Lubrication &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Proper lubrication of moving parts, especially gears and bearings, is critical to performance as demands on machinery increase. Lubrication serves to carry away heat, reduce wear and friction, minimize debris problems, and protect bearing surfaces from corrosion. Increased production often results in higher operating temperatures, faster speeds and heavier loads. Just as bearings have improved in design, proper lubrication selection and practices must go hand-in-hand to achieve maximum performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Too often, companies struggle with ongoing maintenance because of improper lubrication practices. For instance, insufficient lubrication leads to additional friction and increased temperatures, which can cause premature bearing damage. Excess lubrication can generate additional heat, causing the lubricant to break down and lead to potential unexpected and premature bearing damage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recognizing early warning signs of lubrication problems, such as increased operating temperatures, lubrication leaks, and unusual noise and vibration can help prevent bearing damage. With inadequate lubrication, temperature gauges often indicate the bearing is running hot â it may even become noisy from resultant metal-to-metal contact. When bearings are overfilled, the lubricant breaks down and darkens in color because of extreme temperatures. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When lubrication failure occurs, it can result in several types of roller bearing damage, including ribs and roller end scoring from metal-to-metal contact. In extreme cases, inadequate lubrication causes the rollers to skew, slide sideways and provoke total bearing lock-up. Recognizing the types of damage caused by inadequate lubrication helps you pinpoint and correct the problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=264 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_properlub.jpg" width=175&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Proper lubrication maximizes the &lt;BR&gt;life and performance of bearings, &lt;BR&gt;and leads to enhanced equipment &lt;BR&gt;productivity&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Options in Lubrication &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as important as acknowledging proper lubrication levels is selecting the correct type of lubricant for a given application. The most common mediums are oil and grease. Each type serves to meet specific application needs, so making the proper bearing selection requires a clear understanding of the demands of the application. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Common oils used in bearing applications are synthetic or mineral. Mineral oil is derived from refining crude petroleum and can contain unstable compounds such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, which can affect service life. Synthetic oils are free of impurities and are designed for use in special circumstances where normal petroleum products canât cope with temperatures. In most cases, additives are used in the oils to resist oxidation, reduce foaming and improve lubricity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although lubricating oils are uniform in many characteristics, knowing and understanding the viscosity of oil is critical in determining its operating limits. Viscosity is the measure of the flowability of a liquid at a definite temperature. The faster the flow, the lower the viscosity, and vice versa. The oil viscosity must be high enough to provide a continuous film but not too high to generate excessive heat. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The flexibility of oil operates better than grease in higher temperature applications because it circulates more freely, resulting in the dissipation of heat. It allows contaminants to be flushed or filtered from the bearing and can allow the bearing to attain higher speeds. Oil levels also are more easily controlled and easier to drain and refill, yet they can be tricky to seal in some situations. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;On the other hand, grease â a precise combination of oil, thickeners and additives â is more easily confined to the bearing. Grease acts like a sponge to retain and release oil, but it also performs like a seal against moisture, dirt and other contaminants. With no oil levels to maintain, it requires less frequent lubricating and its thickness makes leakage less likely to occur. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Similar to oil, grease also has its limits for upper and lower operating temperatures. These limits change per the type and amount of thickening agents, and the base oil type and viscosity used in making the grease. Operating speeds also need to be considered. Greases typically are limited to a speed of about 2,500 feet/minute (rib speed) because of heat generation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most importantly, what works for one application may not work for another. Each lubricant offers advantages specific to use and operational demands. The selection of lubrication requires careful expert review of these demands to ensure peak performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=116 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_skewed-rollers.jpg" width=225&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inadequate lubrication can cause rollers to&lt;BR&gt;skew, slide sideways and, in extreme cases, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;lock up the entire bearing (shown here).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Lubrication Delivery&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Almost half of bearing failures are due to improper lubrication. In addition to improper fill levels, other factors can contribute to reduced bearing life and performance, including the wrong lubricant or improper maintenance cycles. Experience shows that the application of small amounts of lubricant more frequently results in greater bearing life compared to a large dose over a longer time period. Proper lubrication is an essential component of effective preventive maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Delivery of Oil &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing how to properly deliver and apply the lubricant is important to the performance of that equipment. For oil, there are a variety of methods available. Choosing an oil system is highly dependent on the desired speed of the application. The more heat than can be removed from the system, the higher the attainable speed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here are some oil system options: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Oil bath is a static oil level for low- and moderate-speed applications. 
&lt;LI&gt;Drip feed uses controllable sight feed oilers in moderate speed applications. 
&lt;LI&gt;Wick feed uses a wick in conjunction with a reservoir of oil. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil splash allows the splash from the gear teeth to sufficiently lubricate the bearings. It is used for specific applications such as gearboxes. 
&lt;LI&gt;Circulation pumps assure a proper and constant supply of lubricant to the bearings and are often used for low- to medium-speed, heavy-duty applications. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil mist is used for continuous, high-speed applications and offers a continuous spray of pressurized air and oil to the bearings. 
&lt;LI&gt;Oil jet, similar to circulation, may be used for high speeds and heavy loads but requires large drains to prevent the accumulation of oil after passage through the bearings. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Delivery of Grease &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although greases meet different operating demands than oils, they are equally important lubricants and require equally unique but different methods of delivery. For grease, manual delivery is a viable option, but bearings easily can be overfilled or underfilled. When applying the grease, force it between the balls or rollers until the available space inside the bearing is filled completely. Wipe away any excess grease. The space on each side of the bearing in the housing should not be more than half-filled. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If a grease gun is used, regulate pressure so as not to damage any seals or other parts of the machinery. Grease delivery generally follows the one-third rule. This means that the bearing will expel or purge all grease in excess of about one-third of the volume available. This is especially important for bearings with two shields or seals since excess grease canât get out during operation. Bearings without the shields or seals will expel any excess grease into the free housing space outside of the bearing during operation. This is the reason why you should never completely fill the housing space. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Other delivery options include single-point lubricators and centralized systems. Single-point lubricators provide the option of using several different greases simultaneously on a piece of machinery to compensate for different lubricant requirements precisely where and when needed. Centralized systems offer precise lubrication delivery and intervals, but proper care must be taken to ensure that the ability to pump the grease is not compromised. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=189 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_roller-scoring.jpg" width=281&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Roller end scoring is another common&lt;BR&gt;bearing damage mode that can occur from &lt;BR&gt;poor lubrication practices.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Selecting, delivering, reapplying and maintaining superior lubrication requires following manufacturerâs guidelines and recommendations for each application. By continuing to learn about lubrication and practicing a regular maintenance schedule, bearing failure from lubrication problems can be avoided. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When lubrication is correctly applied and maintained, it increases bearing life and overall machine productivity, and can reduce costly maintenance repairs. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Timken to expand Virginia bearing plant</title>
            <description>The Timken Company announced plans to invest approximately $10 million in its bearing plant in Altavista, Va., enabling expanded manufacturing of replacement wheel-hub bearing assemblies for light-duty pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Timken plans to add 50 new jobs and increase the manufacturing capacity of the Campbell County plant.
&lt;P&gt;"The Altavista facility has been a strong performer for Timken, and we are adding capacity to capitalize on a significant opportunity for profitable growth in the automotive aftermarket with this expansion," said Jack Cameron, Timken's general manager for the North and South American automotive aftermarket. Timken is a leading supplier of automotive wheel-hub bearing assemblies to both original equipment manufacturers and the automotive aftermarket.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Timken's facility in Altavista, which currently has 140,000 square feet of space and employs approximately 308 people, has grown steadily in production capacity since its opening in 1991. The plant produces highly engineered wheel-hub bearing assemblies, including UNIPAC, for global auto manufacturers and suppliers. Wheel-hub bearing assemblies typically have multiple rows of rollers, are pre-adjusted, pre-lubricated and pre-sealed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The expansion project, which will begin in second quarter of 2006, stands to benefit from roughly $460,000 in state and local government incentives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Access to a strong, well-educated workforce and excellent infrastructure in a pro-growth business environment has been integral to our success in Virginia," said John Plazak, Altavista plant manager. "We look forward to continuing our relationship with Commonwealth of Virginia, Campbell County and the Town of Altavista as we build on our strong record at this facility."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/bearings/~4/6Fgy1Ork8Zk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Early bearing failure detection</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the sensor-based method, signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and, hence, can easily become masked by noise and low-frequency effects. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Normally, bearing vibration signals are collected with a vibration sensor installed on the bearing housing where the sensors are often subject to collecting active vibration sources from other mechanical components. The inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. Therefore, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and can easily become masked by noise and low-frequency effects. One of the challenges is to enhance the weak signature at the early stage of defect development. A signal-enhancing method is needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The traditional approach for extracting signals from a noisy background is to design an appropriate filter, which removes the noise components and, at the same time, lets the desired signal go through unchanged. Based on noise type and application, different filters can be designed to conduct the de-noising. However, for a situation where the noise type and frequency range are unknown, the traditional filter design could become a computationally intense process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The wavelet transform has been widely used in signal de-noising due to its extraordinary time-frequency representation capability, which is discussed in detail later in this paper. While most of the signal de-noising approaches intend to detect smooth curves from the noisy raw signals, the vibration signal from mechanical failure, such as gears and bearings, are more impulse-like than smooth. Some researchers have developed a de-noising method based on Morlet wavelet analysis and applied the method to feature extraction of gear vibration signals. These methods seek the optimal wavelet filter that can give out the largest kurtosis value for the transformed signal. However, the defect signature of the bearing is periodic impulses. The periodicity plays an important role in fault identification and should not be ignored in optimal wavelet filter construction. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another challenge of bearing prognostics is how to effectively evaluate the system performance based on the extracted features. One of the primary difficulties for effective implementation of bearing prognostics is the highly stochastic nature of defect growth. Even though a large variety of features can be extracted to describe the characteristics of signal from different aspects (such as root-mean-square [RMS], kurtosis, crest factor, cepstrum and envelope spectrum), previous work has shown that each feature is only effective for certain defects at certain stages. For example, spikiness of the vibration signals indicated by crest factor and kurtosis implies incipient defects, whereas the high energy level given by the value of RMS indicates severe defects. A good performance assessment method should take advantage of mutual information from multiple features and sensors for system degradation assessment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Case Study &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Weak signature detection for roller element bearing prognostics. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most bearing diagnostics research involves studying the defective bearings recovered from the field, where the bearings exhibit mature faults, or from simulated or âseededâ damage. Experiments using defective bearings have less capability to discover natural defect propagation in the early stages. In order to truly reflect the real defect propagation processes, bearing run-to-failure tests were performed under normal load conditions on a specially designed test rig. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The bearing test rig hosts four test bearings on one shaft. Shaft rotation speed was kept constant at 2,000 rpm. A radial load of 6,000 pounds is added to the shaft and bearing by a spring mechanism. A magnetic plug installed in the oil feedback pipe collects debris from the oil as evidence of bearing degradation. The test stops when the accumulated debris adhered to the magnetic plug exceeds a certain level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=237 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-bearing-rig-testa.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=216 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-bearing-rig-test.jpg" width=300&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1. Bearing Test Rig&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Four double-row bearings were installed on one shaft as shown in Figure 1. A high-sensitivity accelerometer was installed on each bearing housing. Four thermocouples were attached to the outer race of each bearing to record bearing temperature for monitoring the lubrication purposes. Several sets of tests ending with various failure modes were carried out. The time domain feature shows that most of the bearing fatigue time is consumed during the period of material accumulative damage, while the period of crack propagation and development is relatively short. This means that if the traditional threshold-based condition monitoring approach is used, the response time available for the maintenance crew to respond prior to catastrophic failure after a defect is detected in such bearings is very short. A prognostic approach that can detect the defect at the early stage is demanded so that enough buffer time is available for maintenance and logistical scheduling. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Challenges&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Figure 2 presents the vibration waveform collected from Bearing 4 at the last stage of the bearing test. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-vibration-fig2a.gif" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2. The Vibration Signal Waveform of a Faulty Bearing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The signal exhibits strong impulse periodicity because of the impacts generated by a mature outer race defect. However, when examining the historical data and observing the vibration signal three days before the bearing failed, there is no sign of periodic impulse as shown in Figure 3(a). The periodic impulse feature is totally masked by the noise. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=197 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-vibration-fig2b.gif" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 3(a)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solutions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: An adaptive wavelet filter is designed to de-noise the raw signal and enhance the degradation detectability. The adaptive wavelet filter is yielded in two steps. At first, the optimal wavelet shape factor is found by the minimal entropy method. Then, optimal scale is identified by maximizing the signal periodicity. Applying the designed wavelet filter to the noisy raw signal, the de-noised signal can be obtained as shown in Figure 3(b). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-vibration-fig2c.gif" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 3(b)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The periodic impulse feature is clearly discovered, which is strong evidence of bearing outer race degradation. The wavelet filter-based de-noising method successfully enhanced the signal feature and provided potent proof for prognostic decision-making. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impacts&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed de-noising method and demonstrate its capabilities of detecting defects in its early degradation stage. The weak periodic impulse signature is successfully revealed and enhanced. Detection of the degradation signature at its early stage gives more time for maintenance reaction and business decision-making and also provides proof for prognostics. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Banter on bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=226 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_bearings.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the Reliability Forum department of &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;, suppliers provide their insights to a question posed by editor Paul V. Arnold. This issue, the question went out to bearing manufacturers: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;âIf you could give one piece of advice that would increase our readersâ bearing life and/or performance, what would it be, and why?â &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=title&gt;Timken&lt;/SPAN&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;This reply comes from Ravi Bhatia, the vice president of engineering for the Timken Companyâs Industrial Group. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFocus on the basics! Industryâs relentless pursuit for uptime may well have an adverse impact on the service life of anti-friction bearings. But by adopting preventive maintenance practices, assuring proper lubrication, and understanding and implementing sound bearing fitting and setting techniques, you can greatly increase their useful life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFirst, lubrication is key. Choose a lubrication system and quality lubricant. Essential to the function of all rotating or reciprocating parts, especially bearings and gears, lubricant film separates contact bearing surfaces under stress and provides essential protection from corrosion and wear. In the case of an oil splash or circulating oil system, the added benefit is heat transfer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âToo often, plants experience unnecessary downtime and aggravation because of improper lubrication. An inadequate lube supply gives rise to additional friction and heat generation, leading to excessive wear and/or premature bearing fatigue damage. Excess lubrication, particularly at high operating speeds, may generate more heat from churning, which causes the lubricant to deteriorate chemically. This also leads to bearing damage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWith proper application and a regular maintenance schedule, you can avoid bearing damage from lubrication problems. To ensure proper lubrication: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Follow set guidelines created by the equipment builder for each application. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;When applying grease, force it between the bearing rolling elements and cage (or retainer) to assure an adequate fill and that the critical raceway surfaces are properly lubricated. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Pay attention to when a bearing needs relubrication. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Watch equipment gauges for early indications of a problem, such as fluctuating and/or unusually high temperatures. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Listen for noise or unusual vibration. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Watch for lubrication leaks. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Consider regular lubricant sampling and look for evidence of contamination. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSecond, proper adjustment is critical to superior bearing performance. Fitting or setting up a bearing with excessive or insufficient internal clearance or, in certain instances, too high a preload can lead to premature damage and shortened bearing life. Besides downtime and costly repairs, poor bearing fitting and setting may affect more than the bearing. It also affects the operation and service life of additional components. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFollowing the manufacturerâs guidelines for fitting, setting and regular maintenance are the best forms of problem prevention. If short on time, correct a pair of tapered roller bearings set with excessive looseness by advancing the adjusting device or removing shims. On the other hand, a bearing adjusted too tight may cause heat-related damage and need replacement. Good bearing fitting and setting procedures must be accurate, repeatable and verifiable after assembly. They also must take into account other component parameters to optimize system performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âProper lubrication and maintenance and handling practices are critical. Failure to follow installation and maintenance instructions can lead to equipment failure and create a major safety risk.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;This reply comes from Daniel R. Snyder, the director of applications engineering for SKF USA Inc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMajor bearing manufacturers spend significant time and resources developing bearing designs, manufacturing processes and prediction tools to meet customer requirements both for original equipment manufacturers and end-users. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn spite of this, bearings still fail. Experience has shown these failures are attributable to the equipment being used differently than originally anticipated by the OEM or improper installation of the equipment. Thus, the best way to maximize bearing service life is to understand the operating conditions to which the equipment was originally designed, use a high-quality bearing supplier, and make full use of available condition monitoring equipment and mounting tools to minimize mounting problems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âAdditionally, a good predictive maintenance program that includes root cause analysis goes a long way to increase uptime for even troublesome applications.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Bearing up</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=265 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_electric_motor.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Experience tells us that when electric motors fail and must be rebuilt, possible non-bearing causes abound. These can include winding, wiring, grease or seal failures, which, in turn, may result in bearing failures (although bearings are not the root cause). Improper motor use and inadequate maintenance can add to potential problems and premature bearing failure. But, proper installation and maintenance of bearings can help extend service life in electric motors for years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âperfectâ operating environment is contaminant-free and has low humidity, low non-fluctuating temperature, good alignment and no vibration. Loads are perfectly balanced. Theoretically, bearings could last indefinitely in a perfect world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In reality, however, you can only strive to create the best possible operating environment. In advancing the goal of motors free of premature bearing failure, follow some basic guidelines. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;1) Manage Moisture &lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although itâs not always possible to control moisture, it is manageable. When motors are running, humidity usually is not harmful; but when they are turned off and cool, condensation builds up. Condensation canât be stopped, but you can guard against the harmful effects by using grease fortified with rust inhibitors in bearing assemblies and frequently rotating the shafts of idle motors whenever condensation is suspected. Good seals also can help keep humidity from invading the cavity. Avoiding direct water spray on seals during washdowns is also important. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;2) Align the Shafts &lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Misalignment between an electric motor shaft and the shaft of the driven equipment represents a common root cause of premature bearing failure. Such misalignment introduces excessive vibration and internal bearing loads and will shorten the working life of an electric motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While couplings typically are flexible to accommodate misalignment, their flexibility shouldnât be taken for granted. For ideal shaft alignment, you should first secure the driven equipment and then install the coupling. Only after the coupling is attached to the equipment should you move the motor into proper alignment and secure it. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;3) Chart Vibration &lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After a new motor is installed, take a vibration reading as a benchmark and regularly schedule readings. When a laboratory technician charts a recurring spike in vibration data (measuring amplitude at a given frequency on the inner ring ball pass) but lacks historical reference points, no clear picture will emerge confirming the data represents an actual problem. Vibration characteristics vary widely among motors and applications. Data documenting a âsnapshot in timeâ will have little real-condition value. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;4) Optimize Lubrication &lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Proper bearing lubrication encompasses the proper quantity, replenishment interval, type and application method. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quantity&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A new electric motor should arrive with its bearings properly lubricated for the dimensions of the bearing envelope. Avoid overlubrication. Adding more lubricant than specified by a manufacturer can result in increased friction and temperature and reduced grease life, potentially harming a bearing and adversely affecting motor performance. Rolling elements require more energy to rotate if there is too much grease. This places a greater burden on the motor. Overlubrication also can cause undesirable heat buildup as the rolling elements attempt to push the extra grease out of the way. Heat buildup leads to friction, wear and reduced grease life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Replenishment interval:&lt;/STRONG&gt; While there is no general rule of thumb governing correct lubrication intervals, base practical intervals on bearing size, type, speed of operation, general operating environment and the type of electric motor (vertical motors require lubrication twice as often as horizontals). Some motors may come with non-relubricatable bearings (i.e., having seals or shields). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Before lubricating a bearing, ascertain the grease currently in use and select either the same type of grease or a compatible product (compatibility charts are available from lubricant manufacturers). Always consult the manufacturerâs recommendation and beware that not all greases are compatible. For example, many deep-groove ball bearings arrive lubricated with urea-based grease (a high-temperature, all-purpose lubricant). Some of these lubricants, though, become sensitive to other lubricants, particularly lithium-based greases, which can cause the lubricants to drain out of the bearing cavity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application method&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Most large electric motors come equipped with a grease fitting and drain plug (smaller motors may not have these ports because they use smaller bearings that are factory-lubricated for the life of the motor). A traditional lubrication method is to pump new grease into the bearing through the appropriate fitting and allow the old grease to exit through the drain plug. Newer technologies, including circulating oil and mist, have been developed to advance the lubrication process and offer key advantages in certain operational settings. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;5) Attend to Installation &lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rebuilding an electric motor will involve removal of old bearings and installation of new ones. For best results: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use a puller to remove old bearings and avoid damage to the motor shaft. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use hydraulic-assisted removal techniques if very large bearings must repeatedly be removed. (Hydraulic fluid is forced into a small, pre-drilled hole in the center of the shaft. The fluid expands the inner ring of the bearing and allows it to be removed). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Match new to old. If the original bearings canât be matched (or if the bearings arenât originals and are inadequate substitutes), turn to a reputable bearing manufacturer or distributor for a replacement solution as there are differences in designs and operating characteristics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Decide between seals and shields for bearing protection. Seals can offer ideal protection from contaminant-laden operating environments because they make positive contact with the rotating inner ring of the bearing. Shields may be more practical for most motors because they extend close to the inner ring but do not make direct contact, thus avoiding friction. Consultation with the manufacturer can support decision-making. Always replace a sealed or shielded bearing with one of similar protection. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
