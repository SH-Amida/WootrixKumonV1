            <title>Standard Work Drives Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you were to ask an operator or even some leaders what standard work meant to them, you might get responses such as &amp;ldquo;standard operating procedures,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;work instructions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;check sheets.&amp;rdquo; These are all legitimately correct answers. What you might not get is that standard work is the basis for driving all continuous improvement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash; Taiichi Ohno&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This statement is often ignored as companies work to improve their performance. The initial attempt to quickly resolve issues so that the team can see action being taken may result in the essential element of continuous improvement &amp;ndash; root cause analysis&amp;mdash;being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An important part of truly understanding the relationship of variables on a process comes from stabilizing the effects of changes made to improve it. Traditionally, one may view the lack of this understanding in Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/0cdf685b-e10d-47b7-b28b-180c1c0e4a10_standard work image 1.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The intent here is to quickly take care of issues by putting into action what we believe to be the fixes necessary to the process. This type of &amp;ldquo;fire-fighting&amp;rdquo; usually results in busy activities that may not be truly focused on the larger root causes apparent in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying standard work to the process and understanding the effect of the changes will allow better learning for the operators and leaders. The effect of this method is presented in Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/e5c86b23-bfab-4775-82bb-a2bc69c0fcad_standard work image 2.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 285px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The critical component in this effort is using tools such as a fishbone diagram or creating a Pareto chart to detail and quantify the issues. The diligence and discipline of executing this is necessary for acceptance and use in your discovery of root cause analysis. At times the activity may be painful to start, but the benefits in learning by all will certainly outweigh the costs and will be welcomed and expected by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to understand the important variables you wish to measure. As you stabilize and improve your process, you will understand the barriers that had traditionally kept you from meeting your expectations. Remember, as Taiichi Ohno pointed out, &amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/mmyotgJZJRE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Start a Reliability Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/584987f6-8c68-4688-bcfc-2ac8706122a8_start-reliability-program-3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 253px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;Where do I start? I have heard this question many times, and there is no easy answer other than &amp;ldquo;pick a spot.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that normally when a company decides to start a reliability program, there are a lot of improvements to be made in other areas as well. I have never heard of a facility in which everything is perfect and the only thing they need to do is start a reliability program to become world class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is tied to almost every other area in a facility, and so when one area is at a low point, other areas are also suffering. I would call on all of the experienced reliability veterans to offer their suggestions to help those who want to start a reliability program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gather all of your best people, including the top people in production, maintenance, quality and safety/environmental. This group should have various levels of technicians, operators and management. The group should figure out the areas that need improvement. I do not only mean specific pieces of equipment, but all of the areas that affect reliability, such as training, scheduling, parts and tools. The list can go on, but the point is that you need to have a picture of the potential improvement to get some direction. The list of improvement areas needs to be prioritized so everyone can get on the same track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick the Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you know what needs to be improved, you can decide on the tools you need to start working. Sometimes the tools are already in the toolbox, which is great. If the tools are not in the toolbox, it is time to buy them. When purchasing tools, you want to buy the quality ones and not the bargain-bin tools that will fail to live up to the task. Some of the tools include root-cause failure analysis (RCFA), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), fault-tree analysis (FTA), life-cycle cost analysis, etc. The tools are not all related directly to reliability either. Your different areas &amp;mdash; planning/scheduling, quality, custodial services, etc. &amp;mdash; can have a profound effect on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Champion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The champion must be a person who is committed to the job and the future goals. Far too often, this hat is given to a person who already has a few hats, and it ends up getting shelved at times. That can impede progress in moving a reliability program forward. The champion also needs to have the power and ability to make changes happen and influence the decision-making process. Responsibility without the ability is a recipe for failure. The champion is normally a cost in the beginning, but over time will pay for itself over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many more things you can do to start a reliability program, but this is a great way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/7_GZ81tbmPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Waste to Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems as if new weight-loss programs and products come out every week. One of the latest is a plastic wrap you place around your stomach. If you strap it around your stomach, you will sweat and lose weight. Brilliant! Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably sweat if you wrap anything air-tight around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the more interesting thought is to wonder why we fall for this stuff over and over when we all know the basic concepts in weight loss, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less energy intake will reduce fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More exercise will burn fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More muscle mass will increase metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you know and understand these basic principles of weight loss, you can apply them and become very successful in losing weight. You will learn that it takes hard work to improve your metabolism and that it is a long-term lifestyle commitment, not a short-term project. This sounds awfully similar to reliability improvements, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Perhaps that is because both topics are maintenance, just with different equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is one of the newer concepts or buzzwords around maintenance. The lean philosophy encourages us to look at waste. What is waste in maintenance? Typically (not always), the largest waste is environmental and safety issues, followed by downtime of production equipment. There are also other losses such as damage due to catastrophic failures, wasted labor due to poor management system, high cost of parts and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key in the lean philosophy is to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we reduce waste?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that we improve equipment reliability. As we all know, the key elements to improve equipment reliability are to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning and scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spare parts management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technical database&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Root-cause analysis practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering and design with consideration to reliability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills development on all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept &amp;ldquo;lean maintenance&amp;rdquo; and all other new reliability improvement concepts often provide interesting angles and viewpoints, but you will end up with the same answers. To be quite honest, there are new technologies, but not much new has happened with work practices lately. The list above has been true since 1972. The hard part is doing the things in the list, not coming up with the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is just another word used to convey doing the basics, but the angle is different. I recommend reading Shigeo Shingo&amp;rsquo;s classic book &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Principles of Lean Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; and applying the basic principles to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/1GrkucLhNqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Saving Time and Money with Condition Monitoring </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent acoustic emission (AE) study identified a potential critical bearing failure that became a planned preventive action for a leading food manufacturer. This also avoided considerable cost and unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic emission equipment and the main tool used during the planned inspection routes were manufactured by Holroyd Instruments. This example will show the value of this type of equipment in avoiding a major unplanned event that could have had massive cost consequences for the business. Collateral damage to the associated equipment would have proved very costly, and the lead time to rebuild could have caused extensive downtime that would have meant disgruntled customers not being able to rely on stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story began in April 2010 when some initial elevated readings were noted at two node points on a large step-down transfer gearbox that were sampled on a seven-day routine. The distress readings were elevated and triggered the alarm level. They were of concern and evident on subsequent inspections. The third elevated reading that was part of an upward trend instigated a planned work order in the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) to investigate and take further action. This equipment could not be taken out of service lightly, as it was at the time constrained by high production demands. Experience with a sister line&amp;rsquo;s previous planned bearing change also played an important part in the escalation of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/9947803a-3bb4-493b-9873-9b1e92eff658_gearbox.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 558px; height: 352px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The input side of a transfer gearbox is shown with the output bearing node point on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On more detailed inspections, it was determined that the bearing with the highest distress was indeed the suspected output bearing. Audible clicks were loud and clear at the output end bearing. The two bearings at the node locations were on the drive line of the motor at the input and output ends of the transfer gearbox. The adjacent bearings on the large, helical step-down gear were still reading low and had no audible clicks. The engineering manager was advised that there was an anomaly on one of the input bearings, that the others were in good condition and that production could continue with targeted condition monitoring. The routine oil sampling was increased from monthly to every two weeks. AE inspections were increased, with spectrum readings now on a four-day cycle. This would give some comparative evidence when the new bearings were eventually fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned change of the bearing set was arranged with the production planner, maintenance manager and product specialist. It became clear that the equipment would have to operate for at least another six months until it became available. Contingency plans were formulated for an emergency change if any of the AE readings or oil samples showed advances toward failure. Warnings were issued that this could occur rapidly if the bearing failed. A new bearing set was purchased, and a meeting was scheduled with the bearing manufacturer to examine the used bearings when they were eventually changed in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AE readings stayed at an elevated level during this long waiting phase, and oil sample results showed no elevated readings in the key elements associated with roller bearing failures. During the weeks before renewal, many spectra were taken from all points of the gearbox for future evaluation. This would rule out frequencies from the oil pump and other components around the assembly. An AE envelope spectrum graph before the bearing change is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/254014f7-f16e-44dd-96f8-d80ead41bf1d_spectra 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 630px; height: 209px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As can be seen, there was something creating a spike at 73Hz, which happened to match the frequency of the bearing race. This provided a clue that there was a race surface defect of some kind and not an element breaking down or the cage disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing change finally took place, and the production plant was turned around within 12 hours so that the equipment did not incur any unplanned downtime. The used bearing set was returned with the transfer gearbox, and the two units were degreased. On first inspection, they both looked similar and in good order. The elements and cages were then dismantled from the outer and inner races, with care taken to keep them in order and in the correct aspect for reassembly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It became clear that on the suspect output bearing, a major spall on the inner race had developed, and every element was pitted with the debris that had emitted. At this point, a representative from the bearing manufacturer was invited to visit and examine the bearings. He concurred that the bearings had lasted very well considering the atmosphere and heat in which they had operated for almost 10 years. This would be considered an end-of-lifetime mode of failure. It may have lasted many more months or could have accelerated to failure within days or weeks. The photograph below is of the spall that measured approximately 10 mm in length and 2.5 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/3a11d97c-28b7-4388-aa85-57dc40e9a028_spall damage.jpeg" style="width: 630px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Spall damage to the race is shown above with feathered edges and surface pitting in the loaded area of the spalling. Note the next layer of material on the right-hand side that would have given way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the remedial work had been completed, additional spectrum samples were recorded and monitored to learn more. Carpet noise levels were lower, and the decibel scale was a third of the previous graph example. The maximum peak was now less than 0.4 decibels, while the carpet level was less than 0.2 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the systems and tools relied on every day proved effective in capturing this anomaly before it turned into a major event. The key to this was the full involvement of engineering with operations to plan in the remedial work with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the lessons learned were that the inspection frequencies at seven-day intervals were correct for this critical plant, the preventive action was started at the earliest opportunity, the equipment enabled the pinpointing of the bearing fault, the audio facility allowed a second reference that linked rpm with the audible clicks and that this all gave sufficient evidence for the planned work to commence at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root-cause analysis was carried out directly after the bearing change was completed to investigate any future recommendations for servicing this equipment. It was decided that as the bearings had reached their end-of-life cycle, there was no need to alter any future planned maintenance. Condition monitoring with AE had provided the confidence to pick up any anomalies at a very early stage in the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>People Make the Difference in Maintenance and Reliability Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people may have gravitated to the maintenance and reliability industry because of the desire to work with machinery. I was trained in engineering and understand how machines operate and work. Machines behave in logical ways. They all follow the mechanical and electrical laws of nature. Engineers are immersed in those laws in their years of schooling. People in the maintenance field thrive on knowing that machinery works and behaves in logical ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article for &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, I pointed out the thought similarities between an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety improvement effort and a maintenance and reliability improvement effort. The idea that zero injuries are possible is a key concept for any safety effort to gain momentum, but how does a plant or an organization really improve safety results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I have experienced over the past 30 years is a continual and steady safety improvement effort. In the early years, much of the emphasis was on identification and elimination of unsafe conditions. The focus was on the machinery and the physical facility. The elimination of unsafe conditions was a normal and comfortable task for many in plant operations, production and maintenance. It was easy to identify and fix defects in machines and facilities that could cause an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our efforts in these areas were successful and improved safety. However, we still experienced injuries. Many of these injuries were not caused by unsafe conditions but by the unsafe acts of our employees. As our organization recognized this fact, more work and concentration was put on preventing injuries due to unsafe acts. We have used various programs to improve our results in the past. Several of the programs used were the STOP program and TAKE 2 program, both created by E.I. DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past several years, we used a program that concentrated on people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors by enlisting these people in observing each other. These observations help remind everyone to think and behave safely. The emphasis was on changing the culture and attitude of the organization as well as on the people and how each person behaves. We have seen substantial improvement in safety results over the past few decades due to this focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similarity in leading a maintenance and reliability improvement effort and a safety improvement effort. Today, many of these maintenance and reliability improvement efforts are solely concentrating on the machinery. The program leaders may become enamored with the new technical tools that have exponentially become more capable and less expensive in the past 30 years. The condition-monitoring tools and precision-maintenance tools have dominated the industry&amp;rsquo;s attention in the past several years. Many others have focused on the analysis processes such as reliability-centered maintenance and root-cause analysis. All of these tools and programs are fairly technical and logical in nature. The tools and their application are very comfortable to maintenance and reliability leaders, managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Certainly, any effort needs to have competency in these technical skills. The need to understand how machinery operates, how it can fail and how to prevent failure is extremely important and foundational to any improvement effort. However, this aspect is the easiest part to lead an organization in the maintenance and reliability improvement effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe the most difficult but most beneficial aspect of leading the maintenance and reliability improvement effort is managing the change process in organizations. The behavior change process from a reactive state to a proactive state is a challenging transition. Leadership of this change process needs to focus on each employee&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. This certainly is not a comfortable action for most leaders. Employees must believe that machine failures can be prevented by proper design, operation and preventive maintenance strategies. This attitude change is facilitated by continual education on the fundamentals of maintenance and reliability principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, success leads the organization eventually to believe that zero failures are possible. When this belief takes hold, the organization begins to accelerate toward a true proactive state. Each person in an organization is important to enlist in this change endeavor. It happens one person at a time through various stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changing an organization&amp;rsquo;s behaviors and actions on a daily basis is one of the key areas that will accelerate the maintenance and reliability process. Are you and your organization&amp;rsquo;s leaders educated in change management principles and ready for this needed behavior change effort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/UGYixQBxbT8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Know Where You Are Going for Successful Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Early in his change-management career, Yogi Berra was advising a professional sports organization in New York on some of the finer points of managing change. At the executive briefing, Berra delivered his change-management theory overview, which he summed up in this single statement: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;ve got to be very careful if you don&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;re going, because you might end up someplace else.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Apparently, the executive board was impressed because they extended his engagement an additional 14 years. Although his actual change consulting career was short lived, Berra did highlight one of the most critical aspects of successful change &amp;ndash; knowing where you&amp;rsquo;re going. In organizational change, where you&amp;rsquo;re going is usually summed up in business terms: lower cost, higher quality, greater customer satisfaction, etc. These objectives, however, are the results of specific, repeated behaviors. How change truly occurs is by getting people in the organization to identify and consistently execute activities that produce the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Intellectually we know this. We are familiar with the definition of insanity as &amp;ldquo;doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,&amp;rdquo; so we know that to get different results we have to do things differently. The issue is that we tend to spend much of our effort on defining the results (KPIs, dashboards, measurements, etc.) and less effort on clearly identifying the necessary behaviors. However, without the consistent behaviors, the improved results are not possible.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In working with organizations undertaking transformational change, one of the first steps in planning the change is to clearly link the desired business results with the necessary behavior changes and then design the change to create the behaviors. This is a relatively simple exercise that is best done as a group activity with the leadership team.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Create a list of all the business results that are expected from the change. The more managers that can be involved, the better, since this will accomplish two objectives. The first is that this allows the managers the opportunity to express their expectations in a public and productive manner. The second is that they will be able to see how multiple business goals inter-relate. This list should be detailed and fairly extensive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Identify the specific changes that are necessary to accomplish the business results identified in Step 1. Again, this list should be detailed and fairly extensive. Each item listed in Step 1 may have three to five or more specific changes. Examples would be to &amp;ldquo;perform root cause analysis on 100 percent of failures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Identify the specific behaviors associated with the changes identified in Step 2. This will also include behavior changes for executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Again, there will be multiple behavior changes for each specific change identified in Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The ultimate success of the change will depend on how successfully the organization is able to create these necessary behavior changes. Many organizations make the mistake of diving into the change effort without taking the time to clearly identify these behaviors. By taking the time to create the detailed links between the business results and the specific behavior changes, you will now know where you are going so you don&amp;rsquo;t end up somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/ICY4T8JxUnc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Time Wasters for Reliability Engineers to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the catch phrases. You&amp;rsquo;ve read the success stories. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the return on investment (ROI) calculations and the positive trending that reliability engineers bring. You&amp;rsquo;ve even lobbied upper management. Your argument has been so convincing that you&amp;rsquo;ve secured approval in this year&amp;rsquo;s budget to hire a reliability engineer. The hiring process has begun, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the results: more reliable equipment, fewer failures and increased availability and production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If only it were that easy. Building a reliability program led by competent professionals takes work. It requires setting expectations properly. Most of all, it requires time. How do you accelerate the process to ensure the maximum benefit in the shortest time? Avoiding these top five time wasters could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether your reliability engineer could have been a fighter pilot or whether he needs bifocals, although not being able to read the computer screen while reviewing an asset hierarchy certainly will slow one down. A lack of an overall vision for your facility&amp;rsquo;s reliability program is the No. 1 reason for inefficiency and wasted effort, not just in a reliability program, but with any initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before I became a reliability engineer, I worked as a project engineer improving equipment performance through sound engineering principles. I often was involved in maintenance engineering activities, troubleshooting equipment failures as they occurred in the hopes of getting the plant back up and running as soon as possible. My boss had read an article about the benefits of having a staff reliability engineer, and literally overnight the reliability engineer position was initiated. I was then asked to take the job.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What changed? The title on my business card and the signature line on my e-mails. I continued to perform the same maintenance engineering activities without any real strategic direction, for we had no vision of what we wanted our reliability program to look like.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I worked within my means throughout the next year to learn more about what true reliability engineering was. I learned the difference between a condition-based maintenance strategy, a time-based maintenance strategy and a run-to-failure maintenance strategy, which we had (by neglect) been practicing at our facility for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I learned that a smart combination of the three strategies is ideal, depending on the criticality of the system in question. I educated my boss, and he educated his boss. We learned that reliability best practices are well-established, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We also discovered that there are no shortcuts. For example, if you want accurate failure data, you need to have a computerized maintenance-management system in place. It needs to have an accurate hierarchy that represents the parent/child relationships that represent your plant or facility. The system needs to be populated by operations and maintenance with work requests, failure codes and material/labor dollars so that accurate analysis can be performed. Building an accurate hierarchy takes time and money, and there are companies that have done it before which can help make the process less painful. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of any reliability program, and like a foundation for a house, if done poorly will result in imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Master Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once there&amp;rsquo;s an understanding of reliability best practices, you need a plan that&amp;rsquo;s in line with the reliability program&amp;rsquo;s overall vision. Develop a clear methodology that can be understood at all levels of your organization. It should start with an assessment of current-state reliability practices &amp;mdash; where are you and your facility now in your reliability journey? &amp;mdash; as well as well-defined tasks that can bring your program in line with your vision. As with any good project plan, these tasks should have well-defined dates and persons responsible for completion. Resources such as people, money and time should be defined, and proper approval from site leadership must be obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Communication is vital to ensure proper expectations are set and maintained. For example, if site leadership doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that before maintenance plans can be developed and optimized, site hierarchy needs to be established and a criticality assessment performed, then they&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re working on in all of those cross-functional development meetings, all the while not seeing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prioritization of effort is a challenge we all face, regardless of industry or occupation. In this economic environment, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly asked to do more with less, and there are only so many hours in the day. Where and how we, as reliability engineers, spend our time is of utmost importance. The reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming: developing cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical equipment; conducting root cause analysis investigations to eliminate or mitigate repetitive failures; implementing effective corrective actions; developing and ensuring proper use of facility management of change (MOC) policies and procedures; identifying limiting factors that lead to high energy, utility, maintenance and supply-chain costs. This list could go on and on, but the question remains the same: where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You and your site leadership can determine where the priorities are and address the most critical items first if you have a well-defined vision, a master plan and the proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Measuring Stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you know how well you&amp;rsquo;re performing? Are you and the reliability program getting the results you desire? Are they in line with the overall vision set forth in your reliability program? How can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Waiting for the year-end numbers is like looking at the final score of a football game to see how your team is doing: you might get the information you want but far too late to make the necessary adjustments. A robust reliability program has a strong mix of both leading indicators, which tell you how you are doing day in and day out, and lagging indicators, which tell you how you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I wanted to evaluate the success of a facility&amp;rsquo;s predictive maintenance (PdM) program, I&amp;rsquo;d need to understand the number of critical assets under surveillance, whether inspections are performed on time, the percentage of identified issues that get entered into the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS), as well as the overall program costs, dollar value of saves and annualized cost per unit asset. Once understood, such metrics foster informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no sense in reinventing the wheel. Such indicators should be clear, concise and make sense for where you and your facility are on your reliability journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you know it or not, all of us are on a reliability journey. Just as there&amp;rsquo;s no job that goes unplanned &amp;mdash; even an unplanned job gets planned haphazardly during the execution process &amp;mdash; we and the organizations we support make decisions every day that affect how smoothly the trip goes. Proper alignment and planning can help you avoid the first three time wasters. Proper execution circumvents the fourth time waster, and proper control mitigates the final time waster. Comparison to industry-accepted standards shows us how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and how much farther there is to go.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Discipline and Diligence Are Key for Root Cause Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so now you have put up these fancy (or so you think fancy) check sheets and charts for standard work, expecting the improvements to happen. Things go well for the first couple of days or weeks &amp;ndash; if you are lucky. Everyone is abuzz with this focus of action, but then it begins to degrade. What is happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diligence and discipline of execution are important underlying details of root cause analysis. The new methods are oftentimes person dependent rather than process dependent. So, we find that the owner maintaining this new system goes on vacation, and the team finds itself quickly back where they started &amp;ndash; frustrated and not knowing where to head next. These new methods fall to the side and are sometimes even removed in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The important aspect of this improvement process is applying consistent performance through discipline. The team members must be able to apply the techniques in order to achieve the performance levels and results expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many of you have ever heard the team mention that we start these new things, expect their input for solving the issues and then there is no follow-through? I am sure I am not alone, or at least hope I am not. If so, then we have not done our due diligence in really creating the importance of our improvement activities and have not committed to training our folks on the discipline of what is expected and holding the team to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all have a responsibility to uphold our commitment of training our personnel on what is expected (when we are there or away). It is this key element that will secure the buy-in needed to really drive our improvement process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/ILy_PlGJ36A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Corporate Culture Cited as Root Cause of Mine Disaster</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recently announced that it has imposed a fine of more than $10 million following its investigation into the April 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch-South Mine, which was operated by Performance Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The explosion killed 29 miners and injured two, making it the worst U.S. coal mining disaster in 40 years. A report concluded that Massey&amp;#39;s corporate culture was the root cause of the tragedy. MSHA has issued Massey and PCC 369 citations and orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The tragic explosion at Upper Big Branch left dozens of families without husbands, fathers, brothers and sons,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;I made a pledge to the families of those we lost and the entire mining community to conduct the most complete and thorough investigation possible in order to find the cause of this disaster. The results of the investigation lead to the conclusion that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, and broke the law as they endangered the lives of their miners. By issuing the largest fine in MSHA&amp;#39;s history, I hope to send a strong message that the safety of miners must come first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The agency&amp;#39;s presentation of findings follows a non-prosecution agreement among the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia, the U.S. Department of Justice, Alpha Natural Resources Inc. and Alpha Appalachia Holdings Inc., formerly known as Massey Energy Co. The agreement, which includes nearly $210 million for remedial safety measures at all Alpha mines, a trust fund for improvements in mine safety and health, payment of outstanding civil penalties for all former Massey mines and restitution payments for the victims&amp;#39; families, resolves criminal liability for Alpha but does not provide protection against criminal prosecution of any individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This agreement can go a long way toward changing a safety culture that was clearly broken at Massey&amp;#39;s mines,&amp;quot; said Solis. &amp;quot;Although this agreement is significant, it in no way absolves any individuals responsible for this terrible tragedy of their criminal liability. We will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office to ensure that the responsible parties will be brought to justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA concluded that the 29 miners died in a massive coal dust explosion that started as a methane ignition. While the investigation found the physical conditions that led to the coal dust explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB, which PCC and Massey disregarded, the report cites unlawful policies and practices implemented by PCC and Massey as the root cause of the explosion, including the intimidation of miners, advance notice of inspections and two sets of books with hazards recorded in UBB&amp;#39;s internal production and maintenance book but not in the official examination book. The investigation also discovered that the operator promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners&amp;#39; lives at risk,&amp;quot; said MSHA assistant secretary Joseph A. Main. &amp;ldquo;Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today&amp;#39;s report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people. The secretary and I are committed to improving the health and safety of America&amp;#39;s miners. To honor the memory of the lives lost at UBB, we will use the lessons learned from this terrible tragedy to fulfill that commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA issued PCC and Massey 12 citations and orders deemed contributory to the cause of the accident, and nine of those violations were assessed as flagrant, which carry the highest possible penalties. Violations include illegally providing advance notice to miners of MSHA inspections; failing to properly conduct required examinations; allowing hazardous levels of loose coal, coal dust and float coal dust to accumulate; failing to adequately apply rock dust to the mine; failing to adequately train miners; and failing to comply with approved ventilation plans and approved roof control plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA also issued 357 citations and orders to PCC and Massey that did not contribute directly to the explosion, including 11 assessed as flagrant. Additionally, MSHA issued two contributory and two non-contributory violations to David Stanley Consulting LLC, a contractor that supplied examiners and other miners to work at UBB, for its examiner&amp;#39;s failure to properly conduct examinations. These violations carry penalties of $142,684.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The accident investigation report, along with supplementary documents, is available on the agency&amp;#39;s UBB single source page at &lt;a href="http://www.msha.gov/PerformanceCoal/PerformanceCoal.asp" target="_blank"&gt;www.msha.gov/PerformanceCoal/PerformanceCoal.asp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/sXY697iVzmQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Keys to Maintain Equipment Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is so much similarity in all that we do within the maintenance planning and scheduling world that compares to other separate and distinct functions. Let me explain. Borrowing from root cause analysis process methods, I trust you are familiar with Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams). These diagrams are one method that is used for product design, quality defect avoidance or variation, or to identify factors that lead to some event, hence the use in root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The categories typically include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man (people)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements to perform the tasks, including time estimates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: Any equipment, tools, etc., needed to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: Consumables, parts required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: Data generated from the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these items combine together to create some output or event. In the case of maintenance planning and scheduling, hopefully they combine to maintain or restore the reliability of equipment, as an example. See, in all we do, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that every product (i.e., maintaining equipment) is the result of a process. Let&amp;rsquo;s break them down individually for maintenance planning and scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man: People or staffing (which crafts?), skill requirements, number of people, contractors or vendors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: The job-plan task steps and sequence; items such as permits, manuals and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: What special tools (man lift, ladder, etc.) are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: What consumables or parts are needed to restore the equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: What do we need to know to improve the job plan? In the case of a condition-based monitoring task, we can take measurements to find something in the act of failing to allow planned restoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, all of these items roll up to complete the job plan and job package that should be created by the maintenance planner. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete all of these items, which three should I focus on first to ensure that I could drive craft effectiveness? From a maintenance scheduling perspective, I need the manpower requirements, estimated hours and the materials, but it can&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The only way that it&amp;rsquo;s effective is if I have a continuous improvement loop that relies on the feedback of the technicians to improve the job plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/f6HEKIkcHbw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Implementing Solutions to Root Causes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Root cause analysis and root cause failure analysis are commonly used terms, but I have always felt that they are somewhat misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, there is not really such a thing as a &amp;ldquo;root cause&amp;rdquo; to a problem. If you try to find a definition for &amp;ldquo;root cause,&amp;rdquo; you will discover a mix of homegrown attempts, but all of them are general or unclear in nature. Here is an example: &amp;ldquo;A root cause is an initiating cause of a causal chain which leads to an outcome or effect of interest.&amp;rdquo; Aside from being wrong, it is quite a bunch of incomprehensive verbiage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem with definitions such as these is that in the real world it is never possible to prove a single event that solely initiates a whole chain of other events. That is because there are always other events before the so-called &amp;ldquo;root cause event.&amp;rdquo; This may seem like semantics, but for problem-solvers, it is important to keep in mind that there never is a silver-bullet answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, is the root cause really that important? In my opinion, the process we call root cause failure analysis should be used to implement solutions. That is the whole idea, isn&amp;rsquo;t it &amp;mdash; to find and implement solutions? If we think logically in reverse and ask, &amp;ldquo;Do we always have to know the root causes to find great solutions?&amp;rdquo; The answer is absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a mill has problems with failing bearings in most of its rotating equipment. After a quick look, we find that equipment isn&amp;rsquo;t aligned, there are no lubrication routes set up, no clean oil storage and no sealed storage for spare bearings. Do we need to do a root cause on each bearing and find out the exact root causes of each one? No. Let&amp;rsquo;s not spend time and money on the root cause of hundreds of bearings. Let&amp;rsquo;s work on solutions that we know will improve the problems. Sure, there may be other contributing factors, but the above will be the most pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many people who get excited in root cause become too detail oriented and lose sight of the big picture and the economics of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, in summary, there is no such thing as &amp;ldquo;a root cause,&amp;rdquo; and plant/mill people need to focus more on implementing solutions based on a practical root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IDCON calls our approach root cause problem elimination to shift the focus more toward implementation of solutions based on root cause analysis studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/lsjRTRxsvyg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Common Excuses for Not Performing Root Cause Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most people know what is good for them. We know it is better to eat vegetables than cookies and chips. We know it is healthier to exercise than watch TV. How come the cookies and chips are flying off shelves while the veggies whither? How come the average person spends 20-some hours in front of the TV while we struggle to get one single hour of exercise in a week? The answer is that we don&amp;rsquo;t do what is best for us. We more often do what we feel like and what is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same logic applies to plants and mills. For example, most everyone agrees that we should fix the root causes of problems rather than the symptoms. However, most of us don&amp;rsquo;t fix the root causes of problems. We keep repairing breakdowns and patching problems with temporary solutions year in and year out. How come? There are a million excuses, but none of those make any sense if we look at what is best for a company over time. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the most common excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. &amp;ldquo;There is no time for people to do root cause problem elimination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is a bit more complex than it may seem at first glance. Most companies are caught in a catch-22 situation where there are so many breakdowns and no extra people to do root cause analysis. In this situation, it is unlikely that root cause is the answer to the plant&amp;rsquo;s problem. Why? Because people have no time to do root cause analysis. They are too busy fixing problems, and there are usually so many obvious improvements to be done without doing a root cause analysis. Common examples are to improve alignment, basic lubrication, implement inspection rounds, implement basic planning and scheduling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adding more people to solve the situation will, in many cases, just increase cost, since people are used ineffectively due to poor planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most frontline people will recognize the problem. Unfortunately, top management often doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the problem, or it understands the problem but is pressured to perform a quick fix to the situation. Either way, the outcome is often to demand cost-cutting very quickly, which means cutting people (contractor first, then the in-house staff), which over the long term just amplifies the problems of being reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is, as mentioned above, usually to implement some basic reliability practices, which in turn will cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. &amp;ldquo;We have tried it, but root cause is too complicated and doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as a practical tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is common to see complicated and cumbersome root cause analysis methods that are supplied by advisors to industry. There are many documentation tools in RCA that can be very complicated. Also, consider that the more complicated the methods are, the more advising time is needed from consultants. If you have had a bad experience with RCA, give it another try with a straight commonsense approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. &amp;ldquo;People are not doing the analysis right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root cause analysis is not primarily about how problems are documented and what charts you use. It is about basic critical and creative thinking. The thinking concepts are easy, but they are hard for most of us to follow. It takes practice to become a good root cause analyst and critical thinker. Remember that most people form opinions based on very little information (poor critical thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, if you ask random people how they researched what car to buy, decided who to hire or promote, what party to vote for, what to think about coal fuel vs. wind mills, or even what research was done to select their faith, you will understand that most people have spent their whole lives making decisions primarily on an emotional basis. Evaluating problems in your plant works the same way. We tend to rush our thinking and make decisions on an emotional basis rather than logical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if a pump is not pumping the required flow, then we decide to change the pump without further information. If a motor is running hot, let&amp;rsquo;s change it out. If a bearing breaks down, it is a mechanical problem. These decisions are almost always taken without RCA and very often without any information at all about the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to have patience with your peers and work on helping them focus on facts and logic. The thinking patterns for most of us are deeply engrained. It requires practice and a good thinking methodology to break out of the patterns to which we are accustomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/43Hbj_i1p8Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Execution is Key for Business Strategies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Business strategies developed by companies are often useless. A business strategy is basically a plan for what the company should focus on in the future. It is a promise and guideline to steer a company in the right direction. It&amp;rsquo;s not too different from your personal New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions include things such as losing weight, exercising more, drinking less and improving their marriage in some form. The universal formula for change in any personal-improvement book or business book is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand what to do&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand how to do it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us compare a business strategy with our beloved New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. We know what the problem is, right? We are fat, unhappy, stressed, whatever. We usually know how to improve (drink less, exercise, spend time with the wife), but we fail to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hard truth is that we try a little. We soon realize it is harder to improve than we thought, and we quit. Right? However, the day we get a heart attack, I think most people get a completely new attitude toward exercising, smoking and stress, at least for a while. Of course, there are different reactions. Some people just roll over and wait for the truck to hit, while others start making improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our economic crisis is like a heart attack. Some companies grease their elbows and use the situation to become meaner and leaner. Some are in too bad of shape in order to survive. Others give up. Which company are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time to do the things you didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do before because you were busy making widgets or tons. Take the opportunity to improve your preventive maintenance tasks, revise your planning and scheduling routines, work on your root-cause analysis activities, clean up your storeroom and build that technical database you always cried about not having. Execute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just understanding or thinking about good ideas doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you or your plant/mill/mine anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/PRRlzYV_0k4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>6 Techniques to Error-proof Your Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When faced with the task of improving plant efficiency, the average plant manager breaks the task down by the five or six existing &amp;quot;departmental silos.&amp;quot; Each silo leader subdivides responsibility, repeating the mistake, and passes it on to individuals. As a result, we see young, intelligent engineers overwhelmed by the task handed to them of &amp;quot;get out there and improve maintenance.&amp;quot; The situation is not so bad for the less intelligent or those who have become automatons; they just keep repeating what has gone on forever and collect another paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	What the plant manager needs is a better way to visualize his situation, a method that will allow him to develop a new strategy. The following insights are based on work done at MIT and by many other professors in &amp;quot;human error&amp;quot; at international centers of learning. The &amp;quot;Error Pyramid&amp;quot; is unique, but the remaining techniques and technologies have been established for 15 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 1 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Most people are familiar with the triangle hierarchy of safety incidents that shows that for every fatality there are seven serious accidents and dozens of minor incidents; and below that, there are many hundreds of near-misses. By reducing the number of near-misses, there will be a corresponding number of minor and serious injuries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Taking the four main activities involved with manufacturing &amp;mdash; safety, reliability, quality assurance and operating performance (accuracy) &amp;mdash; each can be viewed as similar triangles. When placed together, they form a pyramid with a four-sided base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 2 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;People in each silo see their problems as unique and have little time or apparent incentive to work on the other guy&amp;rsquo;s issues. They do, however, use common primary methodologies for solving problems within each of them &amp;mdash; root cause analysis (RCA), cause and effect analysis, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), etc. In my many years of experience, I&amp;#39;ve seen that any change in one area affects the remaining three. In a very specific sense, I always see an improvement in safety and quality as reliability and operational accuracy improve.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Insight No. 3 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient manufacturers have small problem/error pyramids, while the less efficient have massive pyramids that overshadow everything else (i.e., the classic reactive mode of operation).&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The more errors and mistakes made, the larger the pyramid becomes. Alternatively, the more problems that can be solved, the smaller it becomes. Unfortunately, this is a dynamic situation, and even though people solve problems every day, the pyramid of problems never seems to get smaller. Insight No. 4 will explain why this is true.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; We, and the systems with which we surround ourselves, are the products of the human mind. They are by our very nature prone to make errors at a constant rate (see David L. Weiner&amp;rsquo;s books on the human mind). Therefore, having an understanding of how and why we make mistakes is critical to the task of reducing their frequency and effect.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4A &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody ever deliberately makes a mistake, particularly those working among a group of peers. As an example, football players often drop passes, but nobody does so deliberately.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the Number of Errors Made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is needed is to not only get better at solving problems but also to take some action that will reduce the number of new problems being created.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 5 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We need a &amp;quot;non-penal system&amp;quot; that allows us to recognize all the errors so that we can classify them by type and respond to the causes across the organization. Not surprisingly, you will find that 90 percent of the issues identified can be considered as latent or systemic.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many old systems were driven by veiled versions of &amp;quot;the beatings will continue until performance improves,&amp;quot; and we have seen just how ineffective this has been. As one director of manufacturing at a plant with an excellent error-proofing program said, &amp;quot;I can see the value of this non-penal system, but if the screw-up was big enough &amp;hellip; someone would still have to go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Let us assume that your company has one of the few problem-solving methodologies (RCA, etc.) that produces documented multiple root causes that also include the latent and systemic issues (even though the team is impotent in initiating corrective actions). What is next?&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 6 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Having achieved awareness of a primary issue, you need a formal program of error-proofing. The methodologies are applicable across all four silos, and the training involved should go a long way toward eliminating the existing silo mentality.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Developed in the aviation industry and rapidly adopted by the nuclear and health-care sectors, these techniques are saving billions of dollars each year. My experience is that using formal error-proofing techniques can produce some amazing improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/OoYrl8ccTiI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ALS Tribology opens new facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In business since 1961, ALS Tribology&amp;#39;s Cleveland Technical Center and commercial laboratory operation commemorated their 50th anniversary by moving into a newer, more modern facility. Located in the greater Cleveland area, the move was completed on March 28. The new location will accommodate expanded research and development, laboratory operations, and future operational growth. In addition to the Tribology laboratory, the center will house the Technical Resource Department, the Information Technology Department, and present and future centralized support services staff.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Web_Images/Cleveland02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing protection rings help cement plant boost uptime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seemed as though nothing could stop the squealing. Not that the Monarch Cement Company&amp;rsquo;s huge ball mill wasn&amp;rsquo;t already loud. Powered by a 5,000-horsepower motor, it pulverizes 100 tons of clinker (a burned mixture of limestone and shale) per hour. But the squealing was not what Randy Riebel wanted to hear. As electrical supervisor at Monarch&amp;rsquo;s plant in Humboldt, Kan., he knew the noise meant the motor&amp;rsquo;s bearings were going &amp;ndash; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the sound of chronic bearing damage was all too familiar at the plant, which has the capacity to produce 1.3 million tons of cement a year. Since 2001, when the ball mill was new, its motor bearings had been replaced three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We kept greasing those bearings, but they kept on squealing,&amp;rdquo; Riebel recalls. &amp;ldquo;We knew that if we waited too long, the bearing race walls would become fluted like they had in the past, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to another replacement because of all the expense and downtime. It takes at least 10 days to pull that motor &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a major production. Sometimes we have to hire help, rent a hoist to put it on a truck and take it away to be rebuilt. So this time (summer of 2009), I decided to try something else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo; was the AEGIS iPRO Bearing Protection Ring, manufactured by Maine-based Electro Static Technology (EST). By safely channeling harmful electrical currents away from bearings to ground, the iPRO extends the lives of medium-voltage motors and generators, thus improving the reliability of entire systems in which they are used. It is available in a range of sizes to accommodate generator/motor shafts up to 30 inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance-free, the AEGIS iPRO is ideal for medium-voltage motors that drive pumps, compressors, mixers, shredders, conveyors and other machinery used in mining, food processing, wastewater treatment, petrochemical refining and many other high-current applications. The iPRO also protects the bearings of generators in both utility and on-site power generation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel had been discussing electrical bearing damage with Scott Wilkins, manager of motor shop operations for Independent Electric Machinery Company (IEMCO), a local motor and equipment repair shop. Wilkins recommended the iPRO, and Riebel had IEMCO install two of them on the ball mill motor. While for most large motors EST recommends installing an iPRO in the drive end and insulation on the non-drive end, for some large motors &amp;ndash; especially those that do not have insulation designed into them or where insulation cannot be easily installed &amp;ndash; EST recommends installing iPRO rings at both the drive end and the non-drive end of the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel and Wilkins chose the iPRO split-ring model, which is designed to facilitate field retrofits. The mating halves of each iPRO were installed around the motor shaft without the need to decouple the motor from the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A family-owned business founded in 1906, IEMCO sells, services, repairs and tests motors, generators, hoists, welders and electrical distribution switchgear. IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s main office in Kansas City, Kan., has a fully equipped machine shop. The company also has five other service centers in the region. Because they deal with large motors routinely, IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s personnel are well aware of the severe damage shaft currents can cause to motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mitigating Electrical Bearing Damage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If not diverted, shaft voltages can discharge through bearings, pitting the balls and race walls. Without long-term bearing protection, concentrated pitting at regular intervals along a race wall can cause washboard-like ridges called fluting, a source of noise and vibration. The eventual result is motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ironically, some products designed to protect bearings, such as conventional spring-loaded grounding brushes, require extensive maintenance themselves. Others, such as insulation and ceramic bearings, can shift damage to connected equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To boost the electron-transfer rate, the iPRO&amp;rsquo;s entire inner circumference is lined with multiple rows of conductive microfibers. Locked securely in the ring&amp;rsquo;s patented AEGIS FiberLock channel, these microfibers completely surround the motor shaft, providing millions of discharge points for harmful shaft currents and creating the path of least resistance that effectively diverts these currents away from bearings to ground. The microfibers themselves are specially engineered for exceptional flexibility to prevent breakage and ensure that the ring will last for the life of the motor. Because it prolongs the life of bearings, motors, and motor-driven systems, the iPRO qualifies as sustainable technology under the Federal Energy Management Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nagging, Widespread Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Contractors and retail home-improvement stores in six Midwestern states depend on the Monarch plant, which sends cement by truck and train to its terminals in Des Moines, Iowa, and Dodge City, Kan. The terminals distribute the cement to 13 Monarch subsidiaries, which sell it in their respective areas. Some of the cement is sold in bulk, some in bags. And, some of it is further processed by the subsidiaries, which fabricate building products or add stone and sand to produce ready-mix concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Monarch was founded in 1908, chunks of blasted limestone (&amp;ldquo;shot rock&amp;rdquo;) up to 4 feet across were loaded by hand into mule-drawn carts. Now this limestone is moved by huge front-end loaders, 50-ton dump trucks and conveyors to be processed by a series of computer-controlled crushers, kilns and mills until it is as fine as face powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the processing machinery is powered by electric motors and the problem of chronic bearing damage is by no means limited to the plant&amp;rsquo;s ball mills. Many of the motors are controlled by variable frequency drives (VFDs), which induce additional high-frequency currents on motor shafts. A fan or pump motor tends to use less power if the input is modulated by a VFD, but the benefits of improved efficiency are lost if the motor keeps breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such breakdownswere recurring headaches for Riebel, but because the two AEGIS iPRO rings installed in 2009 appear to be protecting the bearings of the ball-mill motor, he has since had IEMCO install the iPRO on nine more motors that had to be removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A case in point is a VFD-controlled cooler-vent fan where the 300-HP motor had to be replaced frequently for almost eight years. Every time, the kiln had to be shut down for at least a day. The old motor was removed, and the rebuilt spare motor had to be aligned and coupled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d send the pulled motor out to be rebuilt, but then three to six months later we&amp;rsquo;d have to do the same thing all over again,&amp;rdquo; says Riebel. &amp;ldquo;For the cooler vent fan motor we tried insulation on both bearings. With the insulation, the motor lasted two years between breakdowns. The shunted electricity might have hurt the bearings in the fan itself. Insulation just pushes the problem on down the line. The electricity has got to go somewhere if it&amp;rsquo;s not grounded. The iPRO has given this fan a fresh start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t really realize what the problem was,&amp;rdquo; Riebel reflects. &amp;ldquo;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much information available about electrical bearing damage. We just knew that bearings would fail and the motor would overheat, but we were not looking to see why. Again and again, we just sent the motor out, got it rebuilt, and put it back in service. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know the root cause.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solved by an Innovative, Green Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is now Monarch policy to have IEMCO add the iPRO ring in the shop whenever a VFD-controlled Monarch fan motor is overhauled.Another such installation was on the 2,250-horsepower motor for an ID (induced-draft) fan that pulls kiln-heated air through a roller mill, to dry the limestone and shale during the raw grinding process. Other motors that now have iPROs include four at the plant&amp;rsquo;s kilns, where air is forced in and out: two 2,000-HP ID fan motors and two 1,000-HP baghouse (dust-collecting) fan motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, because a cement plant is a very dusty place and many motors are outdoors, Monarch has begun to specify that some of its new motors must come equipped with theAEGIS Severe-Duty SGR Bearing Isolator Shaft Grounding Ring, another Electro Static Technology product. As in the iPRO, the secured conductive microfibers of the AEGIS Severe-Duty SGR completely surround the motor shaft for efficient grounding, but this model has a built-in IP56 noncontact isolation seal to provide extra protection from dust, water, and other contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Monarch&amp;rsquo;s maintenance manager, Mark Pily, authorized the purchase of the plant&amp;rsquo;s first motor with a factory-installed Severe-Duty SGR, after consultingIEMCO&amp;rsquo;s Wilkins. As of this writing, a 200-HP air-compressor motor is the only such motor in operation at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We want to keep the bearings clean because we push that motor really hard,&amp;rdquo; Riebel explains. &amp;ldquo;We usually lose that motor because of winding failure. I think most of that is caused by the bearings starting to fail, which causes the motor to overload.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ounce of Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Using a voltage probe and oscilloscope, Riebel periodically takes shaft voltage readings on all the plant&amp;rsquo;s motors with grounding rings. He is pleased with the results because the readings are low, indicating that the rings have reduced potentially damaging shaft voltages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel also gives a high grade to the service the plant has received from IEMCO: &amp;ldquo;In my opinion, they are by far the best shop we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with, and we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with most every shop in the area. Scott (Wilkins) is really involved. He&amp;rsquo;s really a get-it-right-the-first-time kind of person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time will tell exactly how much money the rings will save Monarch overall, but Riebel is convinced the AEGIS iPRO provides effective, long-term bearing protection that reduces the costs of downtime and motor maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;So far, so good,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;On the 5,000-horsepower, since the last set of bearings only lasted a year, chances are we would have noticed problems by now, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any &amp;ndash; no squealing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. The ball mill where the first two grounding rings were installed at the Monarch Cement Company plant. The bearings of the mill&amp;rsquo;s 5,000-HP motor failed regularly until damaging voltages were diverted by an AEGIS iPRO Bearing Protection Ring (inset) at each end of the motor. These on-site retrofits were accomplished without the need to decouple the motor from the mill, thanks to the use of a split-ring version of the iPRO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Wind power company gets to the root of icy issue</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With a steady breeze, a wind turbine &amp;ndash; stretching 262 feet high &amp;ndash; majestically turns its three powerful blades, generating enough clean, renewable electricity to power 750 homes for a 24-hour period. When the breeze turns into a driving wind combined with ice, freezing rain, snow and even freezing fog, the turbine&amp;rsquo;s anemometer, which measures wind speed and force, can freeze up and result in costly downtime for wind power companies such as Clipper Windpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;About Clipper Windpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Headquartered in Carpinteria, Calif., Clipper Windpower is a rapidly growing company engaged in wind energy technology, wind turbine manufacturing and wind project development. Clipper employs more than 850 people in the United States, Denmark and the United Kingdom. At the heart of its manufacturing operations is an ISO 9001-certified manufacturing and assembly facility that began operations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in March 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/13cbbcb8-e4bb-446a-b5f0-ca9452efc844_Jacobsen01.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 269px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Turning to Quality to Improve Turbine Availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As Clipper&amp;rsquo;s first wind turbines came online in northwest Iowa, western Illinois and western New York near Buffalo, the winter of 2007-2008 hit hard and fast, with freezing rain and fog causing anemometer units to fail. While the towers continued to run, without the anemometers, there was no guidance on which direction to move the 153-foot blades to harness the wind most effectively. Clipper initially tried to address the problem through software upgrades, but soon additional anemometers began to freeze, compounding the problem and impacting turbine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a quick solution available and with growing numbers of anemometers impacted each day, Clipper initiated a root cause analysis (RCA), an integral part of the Six Sigma define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) problem-solving process. The rigorous DMAIC approach defines the steps a team follows, starting with identifying the problem and ending with implementing a long-lasting solution. To evaluate potential RCA projects, Mike Trueg, manager of field quality assurance/continuous improvement at Clipper&amp;rsquo;s Cedar Rapids plant, uses a matrix that measures the impact of safety, quality and turbine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;For this project, the scoring met the criteria because of the big impact on turbine availability,&amp;rdquo; said Trueg, an ASQ senior member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An RCA project was chartered to address the weather-related anemometer issues. The project objective was to identify the root cause of the anemometer failures that was leading to downtime and decreasing turbine availability. A project team was tasked with creating an action plan and implementing corrective actions by the start of the next winter season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Following the DMAIC Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Selecting team members for this RCA project was somewhat challenging, recalls Ellen Sennett, who served as the project&amp;rsquo;s co-leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We started with people who had experience with electrical issues since that seemed to be the problem,&amp;rdquo; said Sennett, an employee of Clipper for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In all, seven stakeholder areas were represented on the improvement team, as shown in the table in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/cb3dd9db-453a-4982-9104-83e0213d6319_Jacobsen02.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 115px" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all team members participated during every stage of the project; for example, the vendor representatives came onboard once the root cause was identified. The team worked through the steps as outlined in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/584b0465-d7fe-493f-a823-ddb9f34144c1_Jacobsen03.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 198px" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Defining the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Soon after the initial weather-related failures, the company began collecting data each time inclement weather took a turbine offline. This early data collection led to the charter of the RCA project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Measuring to Quantify the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The data collected indicated that, although the winter weather conditions were severe, both precipitation and temperatures fell within the supplier&amp;rsquo;s specifications for the anemometer. The RCA team developed a supplier-inputs-process-outputs-customer (SIPOC) matrix to quantify the problem and any perceived aspects of the root cause. To pinpoint possible root causes of equipment failures, they also completed a fishbone diagram, which generated 45 items for further study. Next, RCA team members entered the potential causes into a cause and effects matrix to focus on the most likely culprits. The matrix tool enabled the team to pare down the potential causes to nine items for a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing Data to Determine the Root Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next step for Sennett and her team was to develop a data collection plan covering the potential causes with the highest risk priority numbers from the FMEA. In all, data were collected from tests performed on 13 FMEA potential causes &amp;ndash; ranging from improper training on work instructions for wiring the heating circuits to issues with heating the transducer cap on the anemometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After data collection and testing of the anemometer, the RCA team concluded that the supplier&amp;rsquo;s design of the heating circuit did not meet the advertised specification. This failure led to an insufficient heating circuit for Clipper&amp;rsquo;s application and, thus, caused weather-related failures of the company&amp;rsquo;s wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett remembers that getting the supplier of the anemometers to acknowledge that its product did not work in the field as promised was a real challenge. Eventually, data from the field and the RCA project convinced the supplier. In hindsight, Sennett feels that perhaps her team could have involved the supplier in the project a little sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It would have been beneficial to have the supplier go through the DMAIC steps with us and discover the root cause, instead of us finding it and telling them they had a problem,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Identifying and Implementing a Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With the root cause in hand, the team began to evaluate improvements to the anemometer&amp;rsquo;s heating circuits through a series of winter weather-simulated validation tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trueg reports that, having 405 units to replace, data analysis was vital: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why we created our own winter weather environment with a wind machine and a misting device to verify our solution. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to remediate all these sites and then have to do it again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following military standard 810F section 521.2 for icing/freezing rain, the Clipper team directed three rounds of laboratory testing to analyze the performance of three prototypes for an improved anemometer. The first new prototype was immediately rejected because the simulated winter conditions created an ice buildup, which quickly caused the anemometer to fail. A second prototype also failed before a third version finally withstood the extreme weather conditions of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the testing was completed, the team created an action plan. The plan goal was to have all anemometers on each of the 405 turbines throughout the country replaced with the newly designed version by March 30, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Controlling to Confirm Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to the heating circuit improvements based on the lab testing, several other controls were introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The vendor conducts 100 percent inspection of the product through a three-day burn test of the unit&amp;rsquo;s heating system. This eliminates the shipment of any defective products.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All anemometers are tested with a turbine control unit in the manufacturing facility to validate functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The new anemometer design also incorporates a connector that can only attach one way to the junction box, thus eliminating improper wiring in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The wiring is color-coded for the operators who install the connectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Design Stands Up to Mother Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While field testing began late in the winter of 2008-2009, Clipper realized the importance of carrying over the testing into the winter of 2009-2010 to confirm the effectiveness of its improvement plan. Once again, Mother Nature cooperated by throwing her full bag of winter tricks, as 40 to 50 mph winds, one-half-inch of ice, 4 to 8 inches of snow, and temperatures of minus-15 degrees and below were reported at various wind farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite these conditions, Clipper recorded only two weather-related anemometer issues, for a 1.6-percent failure rate. Clipper soon discovered that the two failures were caused by a supplier assembly team issue and were not directly related to the improvements generated by the RCA project. With the improvements and control verified, the RCA project was officially closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The RCA team kept turbine customers informed throughout the DMAIC process with presentations about remediation steps to reduce the weather-related failures. Team members walked through the entire DMAIC process with key customers and explained how the root cause was determined, as well as plans to implement corrective action. Sennett added that many of Clipper&amp;rsquo;s customers are familiar with Six Sigma tools, so the RCA process is the type of problem solving they like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This process helps with customer satisfaction as (customers) know we are taking the time to find the root cause and using trained people to do [corrective action] the right way the first time,&amp;rdquo; Sennett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	External customers weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones who benefited from this RCA project. Employees at Clipper&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring dispatch center, which controls the turbines from the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, facility, saw a decreased workload as fewer turbines required attention during inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett believes that this RCA project and others that followed help Clipper&amp;rsquo;s employees think more proactively and address issues before they become fleet-wide issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our goal is to become more preventive and look at things before they start to fail, and with the Six Sigma processes you can do a better job of designing out the defects in the beginning before implementation,&amp;rdquo; noted Sennett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Building a Culture of Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Trueg and Sennett credit this RCA project for opening their eyes to key issues such as internal testing and expanding the company&amp;rsquo;s supplier base. As a result of this improvement project, Clipper created a plan for introducing new suppliers to avoid potential problems caused by single sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve also developed testing here at the manufacturing site, so if we have quality issues, we can test before sending something out into the field that potentially causes failures or creates the need for a replacement part,&amp;rdquo; said Trueg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett said that while some team members were initially skeptical about the DMAIC process, they quickly learned the importance of taking the time for each step, recognizing that without the structured process, people tend to collect unnecessary data unrelated to the issue. For several team members, working on this project sparked an interest in learning more about process improvement and prompted them to request further training and the opportunity to earn Six Sigma green belt certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trueg is amazed at the change in Clipper&amp;rsquo;s staff once they serve on an RCA team: &amp;ldquo;The attitudes and focus on problem solving with data are a strong part of the Clipper culture.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;For more information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sennett and Trueg recommend the following books to guide your process improvement activities: The Lean Six Sigma Pocket Toolbook by Michael L. George, David Rowlands, Mark Price and John Maxey, and Statistics for the Utterly Confused by Lloyd Jaisingh.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Machinists cite China link in Gulf equipment failure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) on July 19 faulted British Petroleum (BP) for ordering the use of low-cost repair facilities in China to modify critical safety equipment on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to The Observer, BP ordered the use of a Chinese repair facility to overhaul the rig&amp;rsquo;s blow-out preventer, a device that subsequently failed and led to the worst environment disaster in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;High-quality machining within extremely high tolerances is what American Machinists take pride in doing on a daily basis,&amp;rdquo; said IAM president Tom Buffenbarger. &amp;ldquo;News that British Petroleum sent the most critical piece of its blow-out preventer to China for overhaul comes as no surprise. Companies like BP consistently &amp;ndash; and erroneously &amp;ndash; equate cheaper with better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;American Machinists have the skills to take us to the bottom of the ocean and the furthest reaches of space. But if company executives cannot tell the difference between materials and workmanship that can withstand the enormous pressures of the deep ocean and those that cannot, then they cannot be trusted to protect the environment nor even their own firm&amp;rsquo;s survivability,&amp;rdquo; said Buffenbarger. &amp;ldquo;Their negligence is unbelievable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IAM is among the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest industrial trade unions, representing nearly 700,000 active and retired members under more than 5,000 contracts in aerospace, manufacturing, transportation, shipbuilding and defense-related industries.

            <title>Former Intel engineer shares learnings on root cause analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Working in Intel&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing site in Israel and then its development site in Silicon Valley, Calif., exposed Menachem Horev to some of the best processes in the world. So when he overcame a critical barrier to a new technology problem, his managers noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;They told me that my way of looking into technical problems was something I should teach others. I think that was the exact point when I decided to put my experience on paper,&amp;rdquo; Horev says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His experience and insights are detailed in a new book, &lt;em&gt;Root Cause Analysis in Process-Based Industries&lt;/em&gt;, published by Trafford Publishing. The book describes how anomalies get introduced into highly controlled and automated process in the first place, then provides methods for moving from an initial symptom to a sharply defined problem with a known cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Root Cause Analysis in Process-Based Industries &lt;/em&gt;(ISBN: 9781425139773) retails for $34 and is available at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/"&gt;www.amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/"&gt;www.barnesandnoble.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the author:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Menachem Horev has more than 25 years experience in the semiconductor industry. Throughout his career, he held positions in process engineering, materials and failure analysis labs, and process integration in manufacturing and technology development sites. He lives in Israel and dedicates much of his time to training engineers and team leaders in practicing the &amp;quot;Root Cause Analysis: Hierarchical &amp;amp; Analytical Thinking&amp;quot; methodology for solving process and equipment problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/wEa5lLtJYSs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to improve product quality ... through social networks</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When the phrase &amp;quot;social network&amp;quot; comes to mind, people generally think about Facebook or Twitter. Volumes of academic studies have been written on this relatively new phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But engineers who design such complex products as automobiles and airplanes have been operating within their own social networks &amp;mdash; or specific patterns of communication &amp;mdash; for a long time. As with most patterns of communication, gaps are bound to occur. A recent study undertaken by operations expert Wallace Hopp and two colleagues describes such gaps in social networks as &amp;quot;coordination deficits.&amp;quot; And such deficits can be costly if not corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Based on what we hear from managers in the industry, about 60 percent of their quality problems are manufacturing-based and 40 percent are design-based,&amp;quot; says Hopp, the Herrick Professor of Manufacturing at Ross. &amp;quot;We found that roughly 20 percent of those design problems can be traced to inadequate communication. This means that coordination problems are responsible for as many errors as individual mistakes by engineers. That&amp;#39;s very powerful information.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopp recently co-authored &amp;quot;The Impact of Misalignment of Organization Structure and Product Architecture on Quality in Complex Product Development&amp;quot; with Bilal Gokpinar of University College, London, and Seyed Iravani of Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The paper reveals results of the researchers&amp;#39; efforts to identify, measure, and quantify communication breakdowns inside a specific design network at a major automaker. Then it details the innovative way in which they constructed a social network using data culled from reams of engineering change orders. The approach produced a statistically sound model that can help managers better coordinate projects across global engineering centers. A wide variety of firms can apply the networking model since the goal is to predict and avoid quality problems in complex products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The practical implications are clear. In 2006, a survey by &lt;i&gt;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&lt;/i&gt; and the Boston Consulting Group showed that senior managers cite a lack of coordination as the second-biggest barrier to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Blessing in Disguise&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Hopp and his co-authors aren&amp;#39;t the first researchers to use social networks to map a new product development organization. But virtually all previous studies have made use of surveys to collect data with which to build a network. Indeed, Hopp initially thought his team also would rely on a survey of engineers about who they talked to on a regular basis during the design process. But that approach turned out to be problematic. Hopp needed to study vehicles that had been on the market for at least a year in order measure the available warranty claims. This meant the design process had started as long as five years ago. Since vehicle design programs involve thousands of engineers, this also meant that many of the individuals had shifted jobs or left the company. Even if the right engineers could be surveyed, five years is a long time for someone to remember who they talked to about what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopp suggested studying email and phone records to map communication, but the company nixed that idea as too intrusive. But Hopp and his co-researchers did have the engineering change orders &amp;ndash; records that document virtually all of the steps involved in designing the parts that make up the vehicle. Eventually they were able to extract information from these records that provided a map of all the systems in the vehicle, the engineers assigned to them, and who was talking to whom and how often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopp and his co-authors used the data to rank the vehicle systems from simple to complex and to measure how much attention each system and subsystem received, given the communication between the engineers working on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is the first time that I know of that anyone has used an archival engineering database to construct a social network,&amp;quot; Hopp says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From that, they were able to see which systems suffered from a lack of coordination. Any gap between the complexity of a system and the communication surrounding it was a &amp;quot;coordination deficit.&amp;quot; That deficit had a positive correlation with later defects found in the warranty data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopp found that systems of medium complexity experienced the highest coordination deficit and the highest likelihood of defects. That&amp;#39;s because complex systems receive plenty of attention because everybody knows they&amp;#39;re going to be difficult. Simple systems don&amp;#39;t require as much coordination. The intermediate ones tend to be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;If you are really concerned about seeing the mismatches between your organization and your product, what you need to do is quantify the mismatch between those two networks,&amp;quot; Hopp says. &amp;quot;We came up with a mathematical way of doing it which should be easy for companies to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company Hopp worked with is now using an online organization chart to help improve communication and coordination among engineers. The idea is to give all the engineers a big-picture view of the entire project and make it easier to find the right people to talk to during the design process. Hopp hopes to do follow-up research to evaluate the impact of this new tool on the alignment of the organization with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Going Global&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Hopp and his team also have extended their research to help guide managers as companies move toward designing products in several global engineering centers at once. They found that when a complex subsystem is developed in several locations, the number of locations predicts the likelihood of delays in design tasks. This impact is particularly pronounced in complex subsystems (i.e., ones that are highly connected in the product architecture network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, it&amp;#39;s a tough balancing act because companies want to take advantage of global expertise. The best team for electrical systems might be in Europe, even if most of the design work is in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;What our research suggests is that you don&amp;#39;t have to have everything in one place, but if you can reduce the number of design locations on highly central systems, you&amp;#39;ll do better,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;So if you can move a few key people and get your locations down to three if you&amp;#39;re using four, or down to two if you&amp;#39;re using three, you can cut down on delays. I think this type of analysis will become increasingly important as more and more firms globalize their design organizations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For Hopp, the ability to use engineering change orders for network analysis is good news, because the field of network study is growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I think the network perspective is here to stay and it integrates very nicely into the engineering change-order system,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;For complex products like vehicles and airplanes, it turns out we&amp;#39;ve been collecting data all along that&amp;#39;s relevant to this network analysis. Nobody realized it. We didn&amp;#39;t realize it either when we started this research, but it&amp;#39;s right there and it&amp;#39;s a gold mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Survey seeks respondents on how to sustain reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ARC Advisory Group is undertaking a survey to better understand manufacturers&amp;rsquo; approach to reliability for the management of physical assets.&amp;nbsp;ARC hopes to better understand the organization&amp;rsquo;s objectives and strategy, what assessment tools have been implemented, and the improvements realized. In addition, it also hopes to understand an organization&amp;rsquo;s commitment to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers are facing a variety of challenges including a mass exodus of skilled labor and related knowledge base, operating with aging equipment, environmental, health and safety issues, mountains of data to process, and energy management concerns while simultaneously producing quality product. Reliability of operational assets is proving to be an effective tool where the benefits can be directly impact the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), predictive maintenance (PdM), Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and root cause analysis (RCA) are just some of the many techniques available that are designed to maximize productivity through improvement in maintenance and operations practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Should Participate in this Survey?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This survey is designed for, and should be taken by, end-users at the executive, management and plant level who are involved in the maintenance and operational aspects of an organization, and have knowledge about the business situation of their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If there is someone else in your organization that could also contribute, feel free to invite them to also take the survey. All answers are kept strictly confidential, and no company specific information or individual responses will be disclosed. Furthermore, ARC states that it does not disclose the fact that you participated in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits of Taking the Survey&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Respondents can view preliminary results immediately after they take the survey, and all will receive a free summary report after the research is completed. The survey is designed to take less than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey can be found at &lt;a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e2nh4lflg2xmlno8/start"&gt;Sustaining Reliability&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/root_cause_analysis/~4/uTTId7kiKvU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What root cause analysis tool is best for operators?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whenever you are asked to specify the best tool for an application, you must first consider a few things before settling on an answer. You have to consider who is going to use it, what this tool would be used for (its application), and what the outcome is intended to accomplish. We know the answer to the first consideration to be operators. With this in mind, let us step through the remaining areas of concern to arrive at an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;1) What will the tool be used for?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operators in the manufacturing and process industry environment play key roles in the overall reliability of equipment. First, they should be the most familiar with how their equipment should function under normal conditions. The difference between what that equipment should be doing and what it actually is able to do at a given moment in time is the definition of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PROBLEM = SHOULD &amp;ndash; ACTUAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Early indications of the onset of a problem can frequently be noticed by operators during the normal course of their duties if they are trained to be observant enough. While the use of predictive technologies such as vibration analysis, ultrasonics and infrared will give a much earlier indication, operators are sometimes called upon to be the last line of defense before failure occurs. So, one requirement of the tool could be that it needs to be able to encourage and facilitate the use of keen observation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2) What end outcome is desired?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The quick answer to this question is that the chosen tool should be able to guide the operator through the root cause analysis (RCA) process down to the root cause(s) of the issue being examined. There are at least two other key outcomes that would be beneficial for this tool to accomplish as well. After the tool is used and the root cause(s) determined, there must be a system in place which allows for the resolution of the issue. The tool should also lend to easy application since the expectation would be that operators should be able to use it fairly regularly as a part of their daily regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tool for the Job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With all this in mind, I would highly recommend a variation of the five-whys problem-solving methodology. The original five-whys technique was developed by Sakichi Toyoda and came to prominence in its use within the Toyota Production System. The architect of the Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, described the five-whys method as &amp;ldquo;the basis of Toyota&amp;rsquo;s scientific approach; ... by repeating &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo; five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.&amp;rdquo; Later, this technique was also adopted into the Six Sigma methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The variation that I propose is called the Should-Actual Five-Whys (S-A-5Whys). In this variation, before tracing a defect or problem to its root cause, initial focus is spent determining when, in fact, a problem is occurring or about to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Complete the Should-Actual Five-Whys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		From keen observation, determine if a problem is occurring by comparing what the asset or process should be doing under normal circumstances to how it is currently performing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Write down the specific problem, as indicated by the difference between the &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;actual.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ask &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; the defect or problem is occurring, and write the answer down below the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep asking &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; until the team is certain that a root cause has been isolated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operators in a reliability-focused culture should have a questioning attitude and be very observant. The inclusion of the S-A-5Whys tool in their skill set will benefit the organization by the early identification and resolution of problems, leading to increased asset reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Is your RCA effort trigger happy?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Most work environments are reactive in nature. There is always more work to be done in a day then there is time to perform work. This is because of unexpected changes in the work environment that cause the workforce to respond immediately and without preparation to return their environment back to the status quo. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because of this, some companies have elected to do root cause analysis on these unexpected events. When dealing from a reactive point of view, the management will initiate a trigger that will execute the performance of a root cause analysis based on vibration level, hours of downtime, financial impact, etc. Trigger placement is a GOOD and necessary first step. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reason it is a good first step is because the natural progression is to first realize the facility is reactive to an excessive level. This discovery is usually through daily or weekly downtime reporting. Once it is determined there is a problem, measures to control the situation are implemented. Triggers are almost always the first response. Some companies measure employee problem-solving performance based on a weighted system of problem types. The more times the problem reoccurs, the more points the employee accumulates and is then scored at the year's end. Other companies measure employee problem-solving performance by assigning 10 or 12 failure investigations to be completed by the end of each year. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Special_Report2_Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Special_Report2_Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1. Process flow diagram for a sulfuric acid plant. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All this effort is based on the activation of some undesired event. The events can range from an electrical fault shutting down an entire section of a facility to a critical pump breaking shafts every two months. Why wait for triggers to trip and incur downtime and asset damage? It is much more difficult to do root cause analysis when severe secondary damage is incurred. The fact is that triggers are a reactive means to control unscheduled events. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The natural progression from this new knowledge is to stop waiting for triggers to be activated and to get proactive. When this step is achieved, the facility can move to the next level, GREAT. This will also eliminate employee pressure to deliver scores for performance appraisals that may be done in haste to meet requirements. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Performing a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a way to replace triggers and inform management that the root cause analysis effort is based on sound monetary results. Each root cause analysis completed will have a predetermined value that has been identified using the FMEA. This is going from GOOD to GREAT. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Proaction is the insight to look at operating areas with a structured approach designed to uncover potential events that would cause a trigger to activate. This can be accomplished using FMEA. This is a term used often, but it means different things to different people. The common thread is this: FMEA provides focus and points to the opportunities that will deliver a premeasured improvement to a facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;FMEA is a proactive approach to uncovering what you don't know about your operation. This is important because there is an assumption that we already know the identity of our manufacturing problems. This is, for the most part, not true. Some may know what the worst problem is, but it is very likely that facilities don't know what the second-worst problem is or the third, fourth and so on. In many cases, we don't know what the problems are truly costing us because they have been below the radar and have become a part of doing business. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. An example of a data collection worksheet. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An example of this would be a piece of equipment that makes a tangible good, such as a cigarette-making machine or paper-converting machine. This type of equipment can be turned on and off many times during a shift for various reasons. Operators sometimes shut down equipment because of quality defects or run at reduced rates because the full capacity rate causes excessive startups and shutdowns, which in turn cause the operators to work harder than if the equipment was run at a reduced rate. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let us use an example from the cigarette industry. This example could just as easily apply to making candy, bolts or paper clips. In the cigarette industry, there is an electronically generated downtime called a rod break. When this condition occurs, the operator responds by collecting the paper part of the cigarette rod and disposing it into the waste can. The operator then returns the tobacco lost from the rod into the rework container, rethreads the cigarette paper and pushes the start button to return the equipment to the producing mode. This process takes the operator three to four minutes. The operator's response is a tasked action learned during his or her training cycle. This response can take place 40 to 50 times a shift, which reduces the machine's end-of-year productivity by more than 20 million cigarettes. This wasn't on the radar screen because it was a task done regularly; it was considered a part of doing the job. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are many small occurrences of loss that happen daily in facilities and are considered as "the way we do business." When these occurrences are exposed and calculated for annual loss in hours and dollars, the financial impact to the facility becomes clear. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Where do you get the data to perform an FMEA? Managers and others often say that employees are the greatest asset. However, because of technology, analysts prefer information from the maintenance management system. This is a fast way to get downtime data, parts usage data, etc. Most often, the data provided by the maintenance management system is what's on the radar screen or what we already know. When below-the-radar data is sought, it is collected from the most likely source of undetectable or below-the-radar information - the employees. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is not a stretch to say that the people who operate and maintain a facility know things about their environment that will never be made known unless asked. Most employees find a way around problems that cause them pain or extra exertion to perform work. This may include bypassing alarms that go off for no apparent reason, running at reduced rates, changing filters prematurely, adding set-screws to loose couplings, pinning bearings so that they won't move, tack-welding cracked impellers. The list can go on and on. These kinds of activities affect productivity and most likely will never show up in the maintenance management system. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 3. An example of an electronic data collection worksheet. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management can open this door and learn from employees by following a three-step method to performing a successful FMEA. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Create a process flow diagram for the system you want to analyze. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Create a failure definition to be communicated from the top tier of management to the hands at work level. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Create a FMEA data collection worksheet that reflects the issues that are of concern, such as material waste, defect rates, downtime, safety incidents, etc. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Create a process flow diagram:&lt;/B&gt; The process flow diagram reflects the routing of the process. This is usually from the raw material input to the point of storage or shipping (see Figure 1). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reason for doing this is to give the FMEA facilitator and employees a visual for reference during the interview process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Create a failure definition:&lt;/B&gt; A clear and concise failure definition is needed to make sure the employees and management have the same understanding of what is considered a failure. Without this understanding, confusion results and your analysis is compromised. Failure definitions are usually tainted by the business climate, a sold-out condition or slow sales cycle. Failure definitions can also surround a current problem an area is experiencing, such as a high rate of rework, high defect rate, high hand injury rate, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some examples of failure definitions are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is when secondary defects are incurred. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is any adverse happening that has human roots. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is when the asset becomes inoperable. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is when the asset can no longer perform its intended function. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is any event or condition that interferes with production. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure is any event or condition that causes the expenditure of unexpected budget money. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When consensus is gained on a failure definition, you are ready to compile a FMEA data collection worksheet. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Create a data collection worksheet:&lt;/B&gt; The data collection worksheet's role is to create the capacity to capture the necessary data to identify the significant few failures from all the rest. To do this, a very simple rule is used: frequency multiplied by impact. The data collection worksheet configuration does a number of things for the analysis. It identifies the event, the modes that cause the event, the frequency of the mode and the impact of the event mode combination on the analyzed system (figures 2 and 3). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The findings allow you to uncover what &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;you don't know. This allows you to change &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;the outcome because you know your current cost of doing business. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This puts you in the catbird seat. You can see what others can't because you took the time to look. Now you can make decisions according to solid information, giving you the business advantage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With this advantage, you can pick the project you would like to do root cause on by the loss incurred to the facility over a year's time. This will not be the case when reacting to a triggered root cause analysis project. Triggered projects may in some cases tie up valuable human assets that could be better utilized on projects where there is greater return to the organization.

            <title>The perils and pitfalls of RCA</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;My "best practices" column series has discussed aspects of failure prevention (Part 1), life cycle cost and engineering (Part 2), and practical condition monitoring (Part 3). This article will discuss what is traditionally called root cause analysis (RCA) and spell out common pitfalls that I've observed in this area. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Pointing to the obvious:&lt;/B&gt; Many reactive organizations conclude that RCA is the first agenda item for improving reliability. But after completing a few root cause activities, it's obvious that the results will point to already-known problem areas, such as inferior preventive maintenance (PM) and planning and scheduling. The initial reasoning to start an RCA initiative often follows this train of thought: We have a lot of equipment breakdowns, so . . . step one should be to analyze those breakdowns in order to . . . identify the root cause of the breakdowns in order to . . . eliminate the root causes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It sounds logical and reasonable when presented this way, but if basic PMs and planning and scheduling aren't in place, most RCAs will point to these deficiencies. Typical outcomes of analyses fall on the wrong amount or type of lubrication, shaft misalignment, unbalanced equipment, missed inspections and overhauls. The "human" or "process" causes often relate to poorly planned work orders. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If your organization is on this track, first consider implementing basics in PM and planning and scheduling. The improvements will free up resources due to less emergency work and better planned work. It is then at this time that you fully implement a solid RCA process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Implement and eliminate:&lt;/B&gt; IDCON renamed its RCA process RCPE, for root cause problem elimination, to emphasize the importance of the result we want from root cause activities. The point isn't to analyze the problems; instead, it's to eliminate them. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The solutions to problems should result in work orders that are prioritized, planned, scheduled and executed. Other results can be business process changes, revisions to engineering standards and PM updates. In other words, the root cause process must be set up to automatically feed into the planning and scheduling system. There must also be processes for an interface with engineering, purchasing and leadership. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Involve the people:&lt;/B&gt; Front-line personnel (hourly workers and first-level managers) should do the initial phases of the RCPE. In 80 to 90 percent of the cases, the front line will carry out and solve the problems if management set the process up in that manner. However, it's common to see separate groups assigned to problems many hours after the event took place. Extra groups and resources should be the second step only if the front line can't take out the problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This doesn't mean I suggest some type of abbreviated version of RCA; it simply suggests a first effort to problem elimination. Problems often can be easily solved in the early going. They can be very difficult to solve as time passes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Managers must build in an RCA time allowance for hourly people to enable them to solve problems at their discretion. Perhaps start by letting operators and hourly maintenance solve problems one hour per day during their equipment inspection rounds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Thinking is required:&lt;/B&gt; Many root cause trainers spend most of the training time explaining how to draw cause and effect, fishbone or logic tree diagrams. While these are good tools for organizing information, they aren't the heart of good problem-solving. Elaborate graphs also tend to scare off some front-liners. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The primary focus in RCPE should be the use of critical and creative thinking. Use critical thinking to evaluate problem statements, data, facts and possible causes, and in logical reasoning. Use creative thinking when developing ways to find more information, craft possible solutions and verify selected solutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the creative and critical thinking process is understood, it may be a good idea to introduce a tool for information organization. It's not uncommon, though, for a simple list of facts and possible solutions to be enough. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Summary:&lt;/B&gt; To wrap this topic up . . . &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Root cause results are greatly enhanced if basic planning and scheduling and PMs are established first. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Root cause should focus on eliminating the problems rather than only analyzing them. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The front-line organization will solve many problems if processes are in place. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Trainers often spend too much time on traditional charting methods rather than on creative and critical thinking. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

            <title>Rooting for reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s fall. The leaves are or will soon be turning colors and then falling to the ground. Football season is in full swing, and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re rooting on your favorite pro, college and/or high school team to victory. It&amp;#39;s a good time to start thinking about rooting your plant&amp;#39;s reliability on to victory, too - but in this case, I&amp;#39;m not referring to cheering; I&amp;#39;m talking about root cause analysis (RCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;i&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt; magazine recently conducted an extensive survey about the application of root cause analysis in industrial plants. Some of the results were predictable, but others were very surprising. For example, safety was not identified as the leading motivation to trigger an RCA event. Of almost 600 respondents, we found that 77.5 percent perform some root cause analysis in their organization. Granted, the readers of &lt;i&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt; are probably among the upper echelon of reliability practitioners, but the results suggest that this important tool is here to stay - and I believe that we&amp;#39;ve only just begun to unlock its potential for improving plant reliability. I&amp;#39;ll be providing a full report with detailed analysis on our survey findings at &lt;i&gt;Reliable Plant&amp;#39;s&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;Root Cause Analysis: Successful Applications for Plant Reliability&amp;quot; conference, which will be held December 11-13 in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rooting is an interesting verb. In its intransitive form, rooting is &amp;quot;to wish the success of or lend support to someone or something.&amp;quot; More formally, rooting is &amp;quot;to remove altogether by or as if by pulling out by the roots.&amp;quot; Certainly both are required to achieve excellence in plant reliability management, but the latter definition is the business of RCA. What a wonderful statement, &amp;quot;to remove altogether.&amp;quot; The business of RCA is to remove problems altogether by addressing them at their roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, when a reliability problem arises, most organizations either address it at the symptomatic level, seek immediately to lay blame on a person or group, or, regrettably in many instances, both. Root cause analysis is a systematic process enabling you to understand and address the underlying causes of a problem. There are many techniques and approaches to root cause analysis, but they share many similarities. I&amp;#39;d like to share some of my thoughts and philosophies about this important reliability improvement tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;1) It&amp;#39;s not the objective of RCA to find someone to blame.&lt;/b&gt; I should repeat that &amp;hellip; RCA is not about finding someone to blame. The only time we should seek to lay blame on a person or group is when that individual or group takes intentional action to undermine plant reliability. While applying RCA to solve reliability problems is similar in concept to solving crimes - in real life or on your favorite TV show about forensic detective work - the difference is that, in a criminal investigation, there is a perpetrator, or perpetrators, that intentionally committed the crime; otherwise, the event is deemed an accident. While people are involved in most plant reliability problems, in very, very few instances do the people exhibit what lawyers call mens rea, or criminal intent. As such, an investigation, be it root cause-oriented or so-called shallow cause analysis, that is focused on finding someone to blame is destined to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;2) We rarely find a smoking gun.&lt;/b&gt; Often, organizations enter into a root cause event intending to find THE root cause of the problem. In fact, the process is more about eliminating causes that we believe did not contribute to the failure than in actually finding the cause. At the end, we settle on what we believe is a manageable set of addressable contributing causes (see the figure below for the cause categories defined in the DOE-NE-1004-92 standard). RCA employs abductive reasoning, which doesn&amp;#39;t afford us the controls associated with deductive reasoning applied to experiments utilizing the scientific method. We&amp;#39;ve got to do our best, which often requires some leaps of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;3) It is imperative to connect RCA to your failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA or FMECA) log.&lt;/b&gt; Unfortunately, when plants complete an FMEA, they take actions and then bury the FMEA log in a file folder or computer file. Stop it! The FMEA is the manifestation of your risk assessment for a plant, system or machine. RCA is a continuous improvement tool that should be employed for reliability growth. If a failure mode exhibits a high-risk priority number (RPN), you may elect to initiate an RCA event to better understand the failure mode and to develop possible solutions to reduce the severity of the possible failure and/or the likelihood of occurrence, or increase your ability to detect and control the failure. Likewise, the results of RCA, irrespective of the reason for initiating the RCA event, must be incorporated into the FMEA. In some instances, the RCA will clarify already identified failure modes/causes. In other instances, it will uncover new ones. In any event, FMEA and RCA must be linked to gain maximum effectiveness from both. While it&amp;#39;s beyond the scope of this column, this is an important enough subject that I plan to address it in a future technical article in &lt;i&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Exponent---Figure1.jpg" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Exponent---Figure1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. Cause categories defined in Standard DOE-NE-1004-92.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;4) Don&amp;#39;t forget bad actors.&lt;/b&gt; It&amp;#39;s common to initiate an RCA event when a major failure occurs - one that has safety, environmental or significant financial implications. In fact, these failures often get more attention than they can handle (particularly from interested senior management), which often disrupts the investigation team. It&amp;#39;s equally important to initiate RCA events for bad actors - failures that occur with a high level of frequency. While the impact of the single events may be relatively small, the cumulative effect can be quite significant. The cumulative effect of small bad actor failures often far exceeds that of any single event deemed significant enough to warrant RCA. Finding bad actors, of course, requires that you institute a rigorous protocol and system to report failures. This is a tool that most organizations lack (another topic for a future technical article in &lt;i&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, stop just cheering for plant reliability and start seriously employing RCA. More than 80 percent of the respondents to our survey rated RCA as one of their better - or their best - plant reliability management tools. When asked what they could do to get more out of RCA, the top two&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A 50/50 approach to finding a root cause</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Recently, I volunteered to go to the gemba as an inspector on the weld assembly line for a metal casket manufacturer. After some training, I was left on my own to inspect the welded casket shell for the rest of the shift. It did not take long to find problems in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One non-conformance that caught my attention was a scratch in the same spot on nearly 50 percent of the metal units. Following the established standard work method, I sanded out the scratch and pushed the unit on to the paint department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day, I met with the regular inspector and shared what I observed. He confirmed that this scratch was a pretty common occurrence. Since it was an easy five-second fix, nobody paid much attention to it. Does this sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The elimination of this scratch became my new quality mission. I knew I could locate the root cause because it was consistent and easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To track down the scratch&amp;#39;s root cause, I decided to use the 50/50 approach. The technique is pretty simple to use. By dividing the process in half (50/50) between the starting point and the end point, you check to see if the defect appears at the process midpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on whether or not you find the defect at the midpoint, you divide the process in half again, moving either upstream or downstream. By repeating these steps, dividing the process in half each time, you continue looking for the defect until you narrow down the possibilities and discover the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because I knew the scratch could be found at inspection at the end of the assembly line, I went to the front of the line and checked for evidence of the scratch. Finding no scratch on the metal coming into the process, I split the distance between the inspection station and the front of the line. It was there that I found the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My next move was to split the distance again, between the start and the middle of the line. I found the scratch again. I continued splitting the line and moving upstream or downstream, depending on what I found. After a few rounds, I found the origin of the scratch at a single station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this station, I saw what caused the scratch. Ironically, it was the quality check method at this station that caused it. The welder used a metal square to see if the metal casket shell was square. The metal-to-metal contact between the square and the casket created the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that the root cause of the scratch was known, a countermeasure was needed. A simple, homemade plastic cover on the square prevented the metal-to-metal contact. The scratch problem was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By using the 50/50 approach, it&amp;#39;s easy to zero in on the root cause of a problem, as I did in the metal casket scratch case. Give it a try on your next root-cause quality quest.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What constitutes world-class maintenance and reliability?</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;I have 
received many calls asking, "How can you tell if you are a world-class 
maintenance and reliability organization, or not?" &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;How 
well the systems and practices discussed in this column are being used indicate 
to me how far a plant has to go to become world class in the areas of 
maintenance and reliability. I would suggest reading this column with a group of 
operations and maintenance employees that includes both management and 
craftspeople. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;On a 
scale of zero to 10, rate your plant's use of the following systems and 
practices, with 10 meaning that you are so good that it would probably not pay 
off to do more improvements in this area. A 5 indicates that you feel you do a 
good job, while a zero means that your performance is a disaster. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;1) Assets 
are specified, designed and purchased based on life-cycle cost (LCC) instead of 
lowest cost to buy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that decisions 
on what to buy are based on costs to buy and costs to own an asset over its 
economical life, instead of buying assets solely on purchase price. A 
world-class organization has maintenance professionals involved very early in a 
project. These professionals know how to perform reliability and maintainability 
analyses of systems and components. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, complete bills of materials, training manuals and detailed drawings 
are delivered according to your documented maintenance standards. Also, guards 
allow easy inspections on the run, components requiring frequent maintenance are 
easily accessible, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;2) The 
management team is focusing on the same results.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; Operations, engineering, maintenance and stores are 
working toward the same goal. Your organization is jointly focusing on 
reliability performance, not on cutting costs until it sees what results it 
gets. This means that your whole organization's most important goal is 
competitiveness through manufacturing reliability and cost, rather than focusing 
only on maintenance costs and perceived maintenance downtime. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your overall production efficiency (OPE) continuously increases and, 
consequently, total manufacturing costs decrease. This is very important because 
increasing product throughput to sales generates three to 20 times more revenue 
in a normal market when compared with cutting costs for work done to generate 
the needed reliability for increasing product throughput. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;3) A 
reliability and maintenance policy has been developed and documented that 
includes a three- to five-year improvement plan.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;This policy is communicated to all employees. This means 
that you have described all essential reliability and maintenance elements, 
their key performance indicators, why these are important, how people are being 
recognized when improving toward goals, the importance of reliability for plant 
competitiveness, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your employees are well-informed and motivated to do their part to 
continuously improve toward the same goals. People know which product line to 
prioritize because they know what the market demands. Work priorities are not 
based on emotions. Instead, they are based on what is best for the plant. There 
is a certainty of direction and a good understanding of what the future holds. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;4) 
Craftspeople have a high level of skills and front-line supervision adjusts its 
management style accordingly.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;This means that 
front-line supervisors, team leaders or coordinators do not need to spend much 
time instructing people. Instead, they support them through good planning and 
scheduling of work, identifying individual training needs, organizing this 
training, coaching root cause failure analysis, and other empowering tasks. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you have a thinking and problem-solving organization instead of a 
reactive one. People are enthusiastic about what they do. Their griping level is 
very low, and 10 to 30 percent of all maintenance hours, including crafts 
people's hours, are used on problem-solving and implementation of improvements. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;5) 
Maintenance crafts people's work is limited by their skills, not by rigid craft 
lines.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that you might have only one 
mechanical craft that includes welders, pipefitters, machinists, millwrights, 
etc., and another craft for electricians and instrumentation. However, to have 
this on a piece of paper is not worth anything. Your people are being trained to 
use all necessary skills, and supervisors are assigning work in a way that 
reflects your multiple skills or multi-craft work practices. At the same time, 
while you have work flexibility (horizontal skills), you still have vertical 
skills in areas such as hydraulics and electronics and other areas requiring 
specialists. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, you find it very easy to plan and schedule work because it involves less 
people to do a job that crosses over between traditional craft lines. Your 
crafts people's job satisfaction is also higher after the initial frustration 
created by the change you might have to go through to become more 
flexible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;6) The 
level of planning and scheduling is high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Whatever you call your maintenance program, and whatever 
improvement initiatives you implement, you will find that planning and 
scheduling are at the hub of cost-effective maintenance practices. Even programs 
like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
Reliability-Based Maintenance (RBM) or other three-letter acronyms for 
maintenance programs will soon discover this fact. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before you rate how 
well you think you plan and schedule, it is necessary to understand the basics 
of these concepts. First of all, planning can be described as all work you do in 
order to prepare for a job. These preparations include the final scope of work, 
safety requirements, major steps of work, important clearances, spare parts 
needed and secured as available for when the job is scheduled, special tools, 
scaffolding, skills required, time needed to do the job, and so forth. Secondly, 
scheduling means to decide when the job will be done and who will do it. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The following are some effective guidelines for planning and scheduling. 
When evaluating how well your mill plans and schedules, examine how well you 
follow these practices: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;A. 
Planning is done before scheduling. &lt;BR&gt;B. Planning and scheduling are done 
before execution of the work. &lt;BR&gt;C. Scheduling is done for the work that needs 
to be done. Then, you find and assign the right people to do the work. &lt;BR&gt;D. 
When executing a planned and scheduled job, people are not interrupted to do 
other work. &lt;BR&gt;E. A job is not finished before you have documented why the job 
had to be done. &lt;BR&gt;F. You later find the root cause of any identified problems. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
you implement the above planning and scheduling practices, your results will 
show less use of outside contractors, less unscheduled overtime, increased 
overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), less unscheduled downtime and more free 
time to perform root cause failure analysis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;7) Work is correctly prioritized.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;To prioritize work correctly, you must realize the 
consequences of not doing the work before a given time. Consequences include 
environmental damage/personal injury, high costs for lost production, and/or 
maintenance and asset deterioration. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In 
a plant with multiple product lines, it is necessary, at any given time, to know 
which line is the most important to keep running in order to deliver to the 
customer on time. It is also important to know what the added value is for the 
product. In addition, it should be very difficult to add a job to a closed 
schedule at your mill. As a result, you will have very few changes in your 
weekly/daily and shutdown maintenance schedules. Disciplined priorities will 
also lead to correctly performing planning and scheduling tasks. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;8) Preventive maintenance (PM) and 
essential care and condition monitoring (ECCM) content are right.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; To have the right content in your PM/ECCM program, you 
must base it on the consequences of not preventing the failure as mentioned in 
the previous section. Also, the consequence of a failure must be more 
"expensive" than the cost of trying to prevent it. &lt;BR&gt;The right content also 
includes using the right methods for basic inspections and condition monitoring. 
This means that you do not have "check," "inspect" or such as the only 
descriptions of inspections in your PM/ECCM program. Your methods and 
descriptions must be more precise. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of your PM/ECCM should be done 
while equipment is operating. Very little should be done while equipment is not 
operating due to inspections, fixed-time maintenance overhauls and replacements, 
or other such tasks. Also, PM/ECCM frequencies should be based on failure 
developing time and failure distribution, according to results-oriented 
maintenance teachings. &lt;BR&gt;As a result, your PM/ECCM program will be very 
cost-effective. Also, you will do less PM/ECCM than before you implemented the 
above principles.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;9) PM/ECCM 
execution is 100 percent.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If you have the 
right content in your PM/ECCM program, there is no reason to have less than 100 
percent completion of the PM/ECCM you have implemented. Operators should be 
trained in essential care and inspections of equipment and should perform most 
of these activities when it is practical to do so. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you will have very few, if any, unplanned and unscheduled maintenance 
events. More than half of the work you do during your shutdowns and in 
weekly/daily schedules will be as a result of your PM/ECCM program. This, in 
turn, will give you an opportunity to plan and then schedule more work. Also, a 
good PM/ECCM program is a prerequisite to good planning and scheduling of 
maintenance and, consequently, to increased overall equipment efficiency. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;10) Eighty-five percent of spare parts and 
materials are delivered to the job site.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
planning and scheduling are done correctly, the spare parts store will be in a 
position to effectively deliver spare parts and materials to the job site or to 
designated areas. Or, it will at least stage spare parts in, or close to, the 
store area. As a result, you will have very few people going to the store to get 
parts or waiting at the store window to get what they need. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;11) Service level is 97 percent for the spare parts 
store.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;To maintain a necessary level of trust 
in your store system, the service level â getting the right part when you need 
it â must be very close to 97 percent. If it goes much below that level, people 
will lose trust in your store, and to survive, they will start building their 
own stores without the knowledge of the store's management. This could lead to 
the store's management falling under the false impression that they are doing 
very well in their efforts to reduce the store's inventory, causing them to 
continue their current practices. This will eventually lead to less trust in the 
store's ability to deliver what is needed when it is needed. As a result of good 
and cost-effective management of the spare parts store, you will see that the 
store's inventory value is decreasing with maintaining the service level. Also, 
there will be no unknown and undocumented store items in maintenance areas, 
offices, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;12) The technical database is 
95 percent correct.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The technical database 
should always be up to date. Equipment, loop or electrical circuit identity 
should be the only thing needed to find and request or purchase spare parts or 
other information. As a result, no time is wasted in searching for store items 
or other information.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;13) The 
very basics of maintenance are instituted.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; I 
have mentioned many times before in this series of columns that the only major 
difference between the best performers and others is that the best performers 
implement what others only talk about. Best performers continuously work on 
improving the very basics of maintenance, while others often overlook them. Some 
of the maintenance basics include: &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Detailed cleaning of components &lt;BR&gt;â¢ 
Lubrication &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Alignment &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Balancing &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Filtration &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Operations 
practices. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleaning of components:&lt;/EM&gt; Detailed cleaning of 
components and equipment is often a âno manâs land.â Everybody agrees that it is 
important, but nobody wants to do it. In a world-class reliability and 
maintenance organization, components and equipment are cleaned in detail. Such 
an organization realizes that good inspections canât be done without this level 
of cleaning and that cleaning also extends the life of components. For example, 
the life of electric motors (electric life) varies between five months for a 
dirty motor and more than 20 years for a clean motor. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers also work on continuously 
improving lubrication. Their lubricators â because they do believe they need 
skilled lubricators â are trained in component wear criteria and required 
lubrication. Good lubrication must include such work as improving the choice of 
lubricant, method of lubrication, filtration of oil, cooling systems, prevention 
of water content and removal of water content. There are many examples of how 
this work results in significant life extension, lower lubrication costs and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Alignment and balancing:&lt;/EM&gt; Best 
performers have, and adhere to, alignment standards of, for example, 0.002 
inches or less parallel misalignment for an 8- to 10-inch-diameter coupling 
running at 1,500 rpm in most installations. Precision alignment and balancing of 
rotary assemblies results in reduced levels of vibration, longer component life, 
lower costs and increased equipment reliability. On average, a world-class value 
is 0.1 inches per second or lower. Several experts in this area have shown a 
strong correlation between low vibration level and high reliability and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Filtration:&lt;/EM&gt; Filtration of 
hydraulic fluids, lubrication systems and seal water for mechanical seals is 
very important. In most cases, standard filters are not good enough. If you use 
filters that filter out particles smaller than 5 microns (0.0002 inches), you 
will have much fewer problems with leaking hydraulics, bearings and mechanical 
seals. For example, hydraulics will not leak, bearing life will be extended by 
up to four times and the average life of mechanical seals will be more than 
eight years. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Operations practices:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers teach the 
operators essential care and inspection of components and equipment. This 
includes how to start up and shut down processes and equipment without causing 
any damage. In many mills, it is not uncommon that equipment fails because a 
steam system was started up too fast, causing equipment failures because of 
water hammer and thermal stresses, mechanical seal failure because pumps were 
started up before seal water was turned on to the seals, and so 
forth.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;14) Safety 
standards are very high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Without having enough 
statistical data to make this a proven fact, I am convinced that there is a 
strong relationship between good maintenance practices and a millâs safety 
performance. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The 
average OIR (OSHA Incident Rate = incidents per 200,000 working hours) for the 
U.S. pulp and paper industry is about 8.5, though below 2 is considered good. 
Even given the fact that OIR reporting disciplines differ between mills, a mill 
with a low rating is doing something different than the average mill. Three 
things they do better are maintenance prevention, preventive maintenance, and 
planning and scheduling. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;15) 
Front-line supervision supervises many crafts.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;A good organization needs good supervisors. However, the 
role and management style of a supervisor must change with the skill level of 
their craftspeople. To be effective, systems and procedures must be instituted 
to support the supervisor and the team of craftspeople. If your millâs 
craftspeople have a high level of skills, they do not need detailed technical 
instruction. Instead, they need support in the form of priorities, planning and 
scheduling. Both craftspeople and supervisors must realize that people skills 
are more important than technical skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, your mill will see good teamwork, motivated people and high working 
morale. People will also have more time to work on problem-solving and to 
eliminate sources of failure. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;16) 
Individual training plans are developed and used.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a result of a crafts skills analysis, your mill will 
have individual training plans for each craftsperson and supervisor. Your 
training is than very focused and cost-effective. You measure training by 
increased skill levels, not by the number of training hours. In addition, your 
mill very rarely lacks the skills to do a proficient job. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;17) You 
incorporate root cause failure analysis.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Your 
mill has established a reliability group as task forces or as a separate 
function. You know which problems you should work on, by priority, and you are 
continuously designing out problems. Key people are trained in FMEA (failure 
mode and effects analysis) methodologies and are using these skills to solve 
operations and equipment problems. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In a 
bigger maintenance organization, you have a separate reliability group. Because 
problems are a combination of equipment, operations, people and other factors, 
this group might not report to operations or maintenance but to the mill manager 
or independent engineering manager. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your mill has continuously fewer problems. You do not discuss increasing 
your preventive maintenance efforts, but instead you decrease (optimize) 
predictive maintenance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;18) You 
make full use of time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This column includes a 
table that describes the typical, good, and world-class distribution and use of 
time in a maintenance department. If you take some time to study the figures in 
the table and compare them to how your maintenance department honestly uses its 
time, you might be in for a surprise. Before you do this, however, it is 
necessary to go through the definitions for the categories of work used in the 
table. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Daily and weekly work means all work you can 
do independently, whether or not the process is in operation. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Shutdown is all work that requires the

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only planned work is for all work executed 
after it has been planned, though it has not been scheduled. In a pulp mill with 
a continuous digester, or for a paper machine and other processes that are 
difficult to start and stop, this category of work is less common than in a 
packaging or finishing area where there are many minor stops and it is easy to 
stop and start equipment. However, it is still very cost-effective to use this 
category where applicable. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only scheduled work is for all work executed 
as scheduled before it has been planned. You can say that you have turned the 
planning and scheduling process upside down. If you do it correctly, however, 
you plan before you schedule. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Break-in work is all work that is added to 
the schedule after it was closed. Closing time for a schedule is recommended to 
be about 19 hours in advance of execution for daily and weekly work. Closing 
time is about one week for shorter shutdowns (10 to 12 hours) and four weeks for 
a longer shutdown (over five days). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Many 
readers of this column have e-mailed me with questions concerning a typical 
evaluation average. Perhaps this question is coming up because you find that 
your millâs ratings are low. We have done more than 250 similar evaluations in 
mills worldwide and the average in most mills is between 4 and 5. Best mills 
rank above 6, and very few are above 7. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Hopefully, this gives you some encouragement. If you rated 
yourselves above 6, you are either very good, or you might be overly optimistic 
or unaware of your actual performance. Remember that we demanded no fewer than 
50 percent crafts people to participate in the evaluations that resulted in the 
above averages. If only management does the evaluation, ratings tend to be 
higher. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
