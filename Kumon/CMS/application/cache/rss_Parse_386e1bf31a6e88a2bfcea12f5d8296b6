            <title>Using Thermography to Uncover Hidden Problems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Thermography can be used to identify and analyze thermal anomalies for the purposes of condition monitoring of machines. These thermal anomalies are usually caused by such mechanisms as operation, improper lubrication, misalignment, worn components or mechanical loading anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is based on measuring the distribution of radiant thermal energy (heat) emitted from a target surface and converting this to a surface temperature map or thermogram. Thermal energy is present with the operation of all machines. It can be in the form of friction losses within machines, energy losses within machines, as a characteristic of the process media or any combination thereof. As a result, temperature can be a key parameter for monitoring the performance of machines, the condition of machines and the diagnostics of machine problems. Temperature is also one of the key causes and symptoms of lubricant degradation and loss of lubrication function within a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is an ideal technology to investigate thermal anomalies on machines because it offers complete thermal images of a machine or a machine component with no physical attachments (non-intrusive), requires little setup and provides the results in a very short period of time. As such, thermography techniques can be used as part of a condition monitoring process when such a process is implemented in accordance with ISO 17359.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Thermography Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are several recognized infrared thermography techniques in use throughout industry. Comparative thermography is the most common technique, and it is normally used to provide the best available data in lieu of ideal or absolute thermal measurements. When encountering changing machinery operating conditions, the ability to perform rough emissivity estimates and to differentiate emissivity differences on machinery equipment provides useful information for condition monitoring and diagnostics of the machine under the less-than-ideal circumstances frequently encountered in the field. Absolute thermography is used when it is essential to know as precisely as possible the true temperature of a target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparative thermography can be either quantitative or qualitative. The quantitative technique requires the determination of a temperature value to distinguish the severity of a component&amp;rsquo;s condition. This value is determined by comparing the target&amp;rsquo;s temperature to that of similar service equipment or baseline data. Although the temperature value is not exact, it is reasonably close to actual. More importantly, the temperature differentials are accurate. However, there are many applications where quantitative data is not required to monitor the condition of machinery or to diagnose a problem and recommend the appropriate corrective action. In these cases, qualitative techniques may be more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Quantitative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comparative quantitative thermography method is an effective method for evaluating the condition of a machine or component by comparing approximate temperature values between identical items, reference values or baselines. The determination of precise actual temperatures of a component, using infrared thermography in the field, is considered very difficult to obtain. This is due to a certain extent to the physics of infrared thermography, which must take into consideration the multiple parameters that enable a true absolute temperature measurement. These considerations are emissivity, reflectivity and transmissivity. As a result, estimates of these considerations can be readily made to obtain a component&amp;rsquo;s approximate temperature, which in most cases is more than sufficient to determine the severity of an adverse condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since it is not always practical to determine the exact temperature or even emissivities of each machine component, the alternative use of comparative thermography becomes more practical. Comparative measurement, unlike qualitative measurement, identifies a thermal deficiency by comparing the temperatures obtained using a consistent emissivity value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The temperature differential between two or more identical or similar components is measured numerically. Assuming that the environmental conditions for both components are similar, the differential temperature for the given piece of equipment is recorded as being the amount above the normal operating temperature of the similar equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of comparative quantitative thermography would be that, if two or more machines are operating in the same environment and under the same load conditions, and one is experiencing an elevated temperature, this is usually an indication that a deteriorating condition may exist. However, the determination of the temperature difference would then assist in establishing the severity of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, a 5-degree C differential would be considered minor, whereas a 100-degree C differential may be considered to be critical. Also, knowing the approximate value of the elevated temperature would provide an indication that the temperature limit of a component may be approaching alarm values. Therefore, while qualitative measurements can also detect deficiencies, it is the quantitative measurements that have the capability of determining severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Qualitative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparative qualitative measurement compares the infrared pattern, such as gear contact patterns, of one component to that of an identical or similar component under the same or similar operating conditions. When searching for differing thermal patterns, an anomaly is identified by the intensity variations between any two or more similar objects, without assigning temperature values to the patterns. This technique is quick and easy to apply, and it does not require any adjustments to the infrared instrument to compensate for atmospheric or environmental conditions, or surface emissivities. Although the result of this type of measurement can identify a deficiency, it does not provide a level of severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This infrared thermography technique is used throughout most industries. It is very effective in identifying hot bearings or other abnormally hot machine components, hot spots in electrical equipment, undesirable hot electrical connections, leaking or even clogged fluid heat-exchange equipment and its components (tubes), and fluid leaks from pressure vessels, pipes and valves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Thermometry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The determination of the absolute temperature of a target using infrared thermography is very difficult to obtain because of the many technical and environmental factors involved. As a result, absolute infrared thermography measurements are done only if very precise temperature values or small temperature differentials are critical to a process. These determinations are normally attempted only under extremely controlled laboratory type conditions. This type of measurement is not normally used for condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Baseline Measurements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is strongly recommended that baseline measurements be taken of critical plant equipment. This is very important when making later infrared thermography surveys of machines or components and comparing them with previous thermograms of the same machines operating under the same load and environmental conditions. This condition monitoring procedure is useful for early identification of developing problems, thus preventing major maintenance operations or catastrophic failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assessment Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When applying infrared thermography to condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines and their related components, it is recommended that severity criteria be established. Severity criteria can take two forms: they can be organized into general categories that identify temperature levels or zones (versus levels of criticality), and they can be applied to specific machines or components, or to like groups of machines or components. In either case, the levels are established through experience and the accumulation of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In practice, no singular acceptance criteria is universally applicable to the variety of items and applications existing in industry. Consequently, severity criteria must be developed for each category of equipment based upon its design, manufacture, operation, installation, maintenance characteristics, failure modes and criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Severity criteria can be established on individual machines or components. This method is based on many factors, including temperature rise vs. historical data that establishes rate of deterioration and time to failure, criticality of the machine or component to the overall process, location with respect to other materials/equipment should a fire result, safety of personnel, environmental conditions, etc. Applications could include temperature rises of critical machines, mechanical components, bearing temperature rises, electrical supply or connection rises, fluid leakage losses or even the number of tubes clogged in fluid heat-transfer-type equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The infrared thermographer may use temperature difference criteria or classify the temperature severity of mechanical system anomalies. These criteria are usually reported as the temperature rise of the exception above the temperature of a defined reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By taking multiple measurements over time of similar components under similar operating and environmental conditions, statistical analysis can be used to set operational limits for trending and predicting the temperature performance of these components. This type of system may be used in conjunction with these absolute temperature criteria to rate the temperature severity of an exception above the maximum allowable temperature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Relative Temperature Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a set of severity criteria based on categories and temperature rises above established references is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ADVISORY&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Up to a 10-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;INTERMEDIATE&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10-degree C to 20-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SERIOUS&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20-degree C to 40-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CRITICAL&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In excess of a 40-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reference temperatures should be based on temperatures specified by manufacturers of similar items or groups of equipment, or of components located on the same shaft. Baseline temperatures should be based on historical or statistically derived temperatures established from the specific item or machine groups when in the &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Absolute Temperature Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The infrared thermographer may use absolute maximum allowable temperature criteria based on published data to identify mechanical system anomalies. There are two categories of criteria: material and design. Material criteria are used where the integrity of the material itself is of concern and is the focus of monitoring. Design criteria are used where the design integrity is the major concern and is the focus of the monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Design criteria should always be used in preference to material criteria, since design criteria normally incorporate material requirements. Design criteria are usually cognizant of performance, operation, reliability and capacity criteria rather than just component material integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When heating several adjacent system components and a material criteria is used, the component material having the lowest temperature specification should be referenced as the alarm criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most machine cases, the lubricant will have the lowest temperature specification. The maximum allowable temperature should be stated as the temperature above which an unacceptable loss of component life will be experienced due to a loss of lubricant characteristics. Such reductions in characteristics may be immediate (viscosity) or long-term (additive depletion). Such criteria will tend to be design rather than material based. This will require application-specific temperature criteria despite the possible use of common lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many instances the infrared thermographer cannot directly measure the surfaces of actual components. Care and good judgment must be used when applying any severity specifications to actual field temperature measurements, taking into account conduction paths, convection and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Profile Assessment Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Profile assessment is a process of comparing temperature differences and patterns across a surface. As in any severity-assessment process, the absolute and differential temperatures and profiles need to be determined for two key conditions: &amp;ldquo;as new&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;failed.&amp;rdquo; Severity assessment is the subsequent process of determining the condition of the equipment between these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key areas of profile assessment are temperature gradients, changes in profile, historical changes, localized differences, absolute temperatures, location of anomalies or profile characteristics relative to the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Survey Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey intervals should be determined with knowledge of the rate of deterioration of the expected fault and the behavior over time of temperature as a representative symptom of the fault. The determination of the survey interval is primarily necessary for prognosis accuracy rather than fault identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Image Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a machinery viewpoint, thermal image interpretation essentially is a process of comparing absolute temperature and temperature profiles against design, manufacture, installation, operation and maintenance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using thermography for machinery condition monitoring purposes, the operating conditions at the time of each survey should be known in detail, as many changes in thermal profile are operating-condition dependent. The design of a machine is essential to understanding component loading, which in turn is the primary contributor to thermal profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using thermography to assess machine condition, it is important that the machine is viewed as a whole and that each image is analyzed as part of a series rather than as an individual representation of a localized condition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thermal imaging is a very powerful correlation technique for other condition monitoring methods. It is exceedingly useful for assisting with solving lubrication issues that are temperature-related, as it can pinpoint location, source and extent of the influencing thermal anomalies, as well as determine the effectiveness of circulation, control and cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowledge of design, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance-induced failure modes and their thermal symptoms is paramount to successful machinery investigation and solution design using thermal imaging. This knowledge is of far greater importance than specific knowledge of the technique, its applications or its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Study: Mill Drive Train Misalignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A recent case study involved a grinding mill drive train in a gold mine consisting of a motor, a three-shaft reduction gearbox, two pinion bearings and a pinion gear. All bearings were rolling element types with the mill drive pinion gear bearings being double row spherical roller bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The following temperatures were recorded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/28/2935e89f-176a-4985-8849-1ea237525062_Table.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 274px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/28/5ab5aaeb-e8ca-4e71-aa03-3f856e0b4845_Chart.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 263px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Motor&amp;nbsp;Bearing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gearbox&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bearing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mill Drive Pinion Gear&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The temperature of the gearbox intermediate shaft (B) normally was expected to be slightly higher (1 to 2 degrees C) than the high-speed shaft (A) and moderately higher (3 to 5degrees C) than the slow-speed shaft (C), as it was in double mesh at any one time and received more heat input. In this case, the average temperature rise was approximately 8.5degrees C above the low-speed shaft and approximately 3.5degrees C above the high-speed shaft, which was considered above normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The above temperatures and profiles were indicative of a misalignment between the motor and gearbox, a misalignment between the gearbox and the mill drive pinion, and a misalignment between the mill drive pinion gear and driven girth gear. The combined motor to gearbox and gearbox to mill drive pinion misalignments resulted in a loss of end float within the gearbox, trapping the intermediate shaft gear. The 10.3-degree C temperature difference across the mill drive pinion gear was also considered excessive and indicative of severe pinion to girth gear misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The misalignment conditions, gear loading and bearing distress were all confirmed using vibration analysis. Subsequent overhaul and re-alignment of the drive train reduced the temperatures to acceptable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

	Two turbine oil coolers of identical design demonstrated that one of the turbines had an oil cooler problem. Insufficient thermal evidence existed to determine whether the problem was related to oil flow, water flow or both, given that both machines were operating at identical loads. Under identical loads and oil conditions, turbine No. 2 operated with consistently higher vibration due to the effects of reduced oil viscosity resulting from higher operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Identifying Mechanical Faults with Motor Current Signature Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has proven to be a highly valuable predictive maintenance tool. Although it is a relatively young, rarely utilized technology, it is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry today. Mechanical faults related to belts, couplers, alignment and more are easily found through the use of a demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MCSA is simply the process by which motor current readings are recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain. It has been around since 1985 and proven itself well over the years in locating rotor faults and air gap problems in motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor current signature is recorded in a time domain format. The current is represented in a graph form with the amplitude shown on the &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; axis and the time on the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; axis. The result is a typical current sinewave shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to analyze the data, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed. An FFT is a mathematical operation designed to extract the frequency information from the time domain and transform it into the frequency domain. An example of an FFT spectrum is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the FFT spectrum is a great source for identification of rotor bar problems in motors, it proved difficult to analyze most other frequencies. In order to address this problem, the demodulated current spectrum was developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/23/eb7d1922-096a-4a94-b83b-1770a99cbe8a_Figure 1-2.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 182px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Time Domain Format&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. FFT Format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Demodulated Current Spectrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, one of the most exciting advancements in PdM technologies is the demodulated current spectrum. In order to better understand demodulation, the concept of modulation should briefly be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modulation is when lower frequencies are merged on top of a higher frequency. In other words, lower frequencies ride on the higher frequency signal. This makes the carrier frequency the dominant peak in the FFT spectrum, and most of the information is lost in the noise floor of the spectrum. Although they have always been present in the current spectrum, the repetitive load variation frequencies have been difficult to identify and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demodulation is simply the process of taking the carrier frequency out of the spectrum. In this case, the carrier frequency is the fundamental electrical frequency being used. The fundamental frequency in the United States is 60 Hz. In many other countries, it is 50 Hz. After removing the carrier frequency, the frequencies related to repetitive load variations are left behind and shown on the demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequencies such as speed, pole pass, belt pass, vane pass, gears and bearing frequencies can be identified and trended in the demodulated current spectrum. In effect, the motor is acting like a permanently installed transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the technology being relatively new, trending remains the most accurate method of identifying a problem in a machine. The ability to have baseline data when the machine is in good health is ideal, while comparing data to similar machines is also very effective. In the future, as historical and statistical data is compiled, there will be more alarming guidelines established for different types of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Locating Belt Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic current signature of a belt-driven machine is shown in Figure 3. It shows the fundamental 60 Hz frequency being the dominant peak. Note the sideband peaks on each side of 60 Hz that are labeled with their frequencies. This type of signature has the potential of being misconstrued as a potential rotor bar problem. In this example, the sidebands are actually related to belt pass frequency. The mechanical frequency in rotations per minute (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) is calculated using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Mechanical frequency = (the change&amp;nbsp;between line frequency and peak of interest) x 60&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mechanical frequency of interest in this case would then be calculated by multiplying 6.5 Hz by 60. The result would be 390 &lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;, which is the belt pass frequency of this machine. Rotor bar problems show up at pole pass frequency, with the peaks much closer to the fundamental frequency. Pole pass frequency is calculated with the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;PolePass= synchronous speed &amp;ndash; (slip frequency / # of poles)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/18/ba32daa5-0094-4505-bf4d-2c84153b6daf_Figure 3 and 4.jpeg" style="width: 601px; height: 246px;" /&gt;Figure 3. Belted machine current spectrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Demodulated spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the mechanical peaks in Figure 3 are prevalent, this is often not the case. Usually, the mechanical peaks will be lost in the noise floor of this type of spectrum. This is where the demodulated signal becomes so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 shows the demodulated spectrum derived from the current signature in Figure 3. Notice how much cleaner and easier to read this example appears. Without the 60 Hz electrical frequency present, the remaining mechanical frequencies become much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sideband frequencies shown in Figure 3 now show up in Figure 4 at 6.5 Hz along with a 2x and 3x belt pass frequency in the demodulated spectrum. Looking closely at the current spectrum, the 2x and 3x frequencies are present but not as easily identified. Belt pass peaks in this type of spectrum are good early indicators of belt alignment, wear and sheave problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Running Speed Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both drive and driven speeds will also be found in the spectrum if there is a problem. As in vibration, a 1x rotational speed will signify an unbalanced effect on the machine. In Figure 4, the fan speed shows up at just over 25 Hz. In Figure 5, the running speed of an 1,800-&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt; pump motor can be identified at just less than 30 Hz. In both cases, trending the amplitude of these peaks can tell us many things about the condition of the machine. Normally, this peak will be at or near the noise floor of the spectrum. The two most common reasons that the amplitude will climb on direct-drive pump assemblies are due to misalignment or a damaged coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amplitude response on the spectrum is remarkably sensitive. A noticeable amplitude increase will occur with the incorrect key length in the hub. The common flexible-type couplings used will also show up when they fatigue, crack or become twisted. An example of a brittle flexible coupling with stress cracking is shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the follow-up test completed after a new coupler and laser alignment was performed. Notice the amplitude of the rotational speed peak at 30 Hz relative to the amplitude of the low-frequency product flow noise in each spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Demodulation Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another common frequency found in a demodulated current spectrum is the pump vane pass and fan blade pass frequency. This will help to trend and locate problems with the impeller or flow restrictions. In a demodulated current spectrum, it is calculated by using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Vane pass = pole pass frequency x # of vanes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the growth of the technology, knowledge and software advancements, locating bearing faults, gear mesh and other mechanical frequencies with MCSA will also become more common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Incorporating into a PdM program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all that demodulated MCSA can do, there are still many questions as to how it will fit into and benefit a PdM program. Frequently asked questions might include: Why do I care about finding mechanical faults with a demodulated current signal if I can find them with technologies like vibration analysis or infrared thermography? How reliable is the data that is generated and can it take the place of vibration? How often should MCSA be completed on equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With any condition monitoring technology, there are strengths and weaknesses. Each technology applied will give a more complete view of the health of the equipment. For best results, it is recommended to complete MCSA at least quarterly. If a program is testing less frequently than this, the overall results of the motor testing program will be compromised. As with any technology, it is critical to have enough data to accurately trend the history of the machine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for MCSA technology looking for mechanical faults, there are many reasons why this can benefit a PdM program. For example, when it comes to belt and coupler problems, demodulation will give an earlier and often more accurate fault indication than vibration analysis. The amount of energy created by the early stages of this type of fault is relatively low. When belts or couplers begin to wear, it is often not noticed in a vibration spectrum until the fault is nearing catastrophic failure. A demodulated current spectrum has the ability to detect the fault early enough to provide plenty of time to plan and schedule the repairs. However, demodulated MCSA is not intended to take the place of a vibration program. It is best used as a complimentary technology to a good vibration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An added benefit of this technology would be in remote equipment locations or areas where equipment is not accessible during normal operations. On this type of equipment, visual inspections can be difficult, and the ability to perform vibration analysis is limited. Depending on the risk assessment, remote wiring transducers for vibration may be too costly. In this case, MCSA would work well due to the ability of the equipment to be tested from the motor control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of any strong PdM program is having the ability to verify a fault with more than one technology. This not only ensures the validity of the fault but also helps make a more accurate and precise repair recommendation. The importance of verification with a second technology is never more evident than on a critical piece of equipment that requires plant outages for repair. Demodulated MCSA brings an added dimension to this effort and has proven itself to be an invaluable tool for any PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/frEwzOdb6YM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>PdM software innovations lead to improved operating margins</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The current crop of predictive maintenance (PdM) management software now delivers instantaneous decision-making power for those engineers and plant managers charged with wringing the maximum utility from their facilities while conserving maintenance costs. Capable of instantly analyzing and interpreting vibration data &amp;ndash; along with ferrography, used-lubricant analysis and visual inspections &amp;ndash; today&amp;rsquo;s PdM software not only delivers integrated and prioritized information to plant managers in their offices, but throughout the entire organization via enterprise-wide &amp;ldquo;electronic in-trays,&amp;rdquo; text messages, pager alerts and even HTML pages accessible via a common Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Predicting the repair needs of critical components in lathes, mills, turbines, fans, drills, pumps and any other rotating device allows today&amp;rsquo;s MRO executives to control the destiny of their plant&amp;rsquo;s operations by preventing unexpected shutdowns in the first place. This ability to plan for the future is no longer the domain of Fortune 500 companies, as PdM software&amp;rsquo;s power to deliver answers, not merely data, has even trickled down to small and mid-sized businesses. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building upon the past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that plant engineers relied on run-to-fail (RTF) maintenance schedules &amp;ndash; a method that almost guaranteed unscheduled process line shutdowns. Hardly satisfactory, the maintenance industry welcomed advances in computerization as a means to help prevent expensive machine breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we started out doing machine condition analysis for the U.S. Navy back in 1966, the vibration work was all manual,&amp;rdquo; recalls Dean Lofall, the product development manager for Woburn, Mass.-based Azima DLI, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced suppliers of vibration analysis instruments and PdM programs. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d have a group of engineers that went out on the ship for 10 days to gather all the measurements via analog instrumentation tape recordings. It would then be played back by technicians through a processor to produce a five-foot high stack of graphs. For the next three weeks, a group of engineers would go through all the data, manually categorizing all the machinery and making specific repair recommendations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even the private sector &amp;ldquo;made do&amp;rdquo; with rudimentary results while absorbing huge manpower expenses. Automakers and power companies, for example, would maintain vast banks of vibration experts for the sole purpose of tracking machine life. Perhaps the persistent vision of massive mainframes crunching data from cumbersome Winchester drives possibly accounts for the reluctance of some individuals to believe that today&amp;rsquo;s basic PdM software can run on nothing more than a first-generation Pentium desktop computer. Yet, given the comparative low cost of entry and the gains to be had, maintenance managers of even small manufacturing facilities are now turning to full-featured PdM systems. Such are the advances that have been made over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s systems save money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Overly cautious, prevention-minded systems of the last decade wasted valuable maintenance resources by manually analyzing each piece of new data, whether the machines needed attention or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve observed that 80 percent of the machines in a typical plant will have no serious mechanical faults,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;So why waste time on machine parts that have no need for replacement? State-of-the-art predictiveprograms employ expert systems to weed out machine test-results that look acceptable; thus allowing analysts to focus only on those machines that may have faults. The time saved by not manually reviewing the data from every single machine in a plant is significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example: Some 30 years after its initial work for the Navy, Azima DLI deployed its expert system of PdM software to analyze data for thousands of machines within the U.S. Navy Sealift Command. A subsequent study of 332 such machines confirmed savings of between $47,000 and $62,000 per month, as opposed to manually calculating the data with in-house engineers. The accuracy rate proved to be 8 percent greater with the PdM system, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s PdM systems even predict the future of new equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Spectacular gains in maintenance efficiency and dollar savings have resulted from integrating modern PdM systems into existing facilities. Yet, the use of PdM to predict the useful life of brand newmachines promises to save organizations even more money. In recent years, DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Toledo North assembly plant avoided costly downtime by accurately predicting maintenance failures in newly purchased equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During the launch period of this new plant we requested evaluations via vibration analysis and infrared analysis as one of our buy-off criteria before we signed off on the equipment and took ownership,&amp;rdquo; recalls Terry Kulczak, the maintenance advisor for the Toledo plant. &amp;ldquo;We had already settled on the Azima DLI system for this task because we had good success with it at our Durango plant in Newark, Delaware.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kulczak explains that his team used their PdM system to evaluate more than 600 pieces of new equipment such as regenerative thermal oxidizer motors, water pumps, cooling fans and gearboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the software, we found that there were some machines out there that weren&amp;rsquo;t up to spec,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;Some had bad bearings, alignment problems and improperly sized shims, which led to excessive vibration. These had to be changed out, and it was all done under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At least 106 pieces of equipment needed adjustment or new parts. In his report to management, Kulczak estimated that the maintenance costs to repair these defects &amp;ndash; had they not been detected in advance &amp;ndash; would amount to at least $31,000, with a possible maximum cost of $112,000. Production losses due to failed machinery would have resulted in even greater losses to the plant&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The software analyzed the data and spit out the summary sheet, so you can go back into the data and decipher it a little more closely if you want,&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;From what I understand, older software out there did not have these features. A lot of the contractors questioned our calls, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t use DLI. But we showed them the data and it turns out we were right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains made possible through improved data collectors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The above-mentioned, bottom-line savings earned by investments in maintenance management have occurred through the continuous evolution of each element of the PdM chain. Progress has been achieved at every step, beginning with technological advances in field instrumentation that measures torsional vibration, torque and horsepower, motor current, structural vibration, shaft alignment, and acoustics with every increasing accuracy and fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even more important, an emphasis on portability has placed condition monitoring into the hands, literally, of production floor personnel. As proof, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX pen-tablet handheld computer can host a replica of an entire condition monitoring database &amp;ndash; capabilities previously reserved only for high-end desktops. With analysis tools and automated diagnostics onboard, the user enjoys a tremendous advantage in obtaining immediate answers while in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s versatile and portable data collection systems, we&amp;rsquo;re basically doing EKGs on machines,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Just like when you go to the doctor, an EKG will detect any early problems. Similarly, machines will give off precursors, or early indicators, of future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced processing tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next-greatest boon for plant managers can be attributed to the manner in which this data is now processed with almost real-time speed to deliver intelligent answers regarding machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s vibration analysis software uses an empirical, rule-based logic system that utilizes order-normalized data, spectrum analysis, cepstrum analysis, demodulated data analysis, and other proprietary algorithms to deliver information with an emphasis on providing a straightforward user interface. All data and functions are made available from a single-layer intuitive screen that is quickly organized via a built-in setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If you have a failing machine, then today&amp;rsquo;s software can tell you the severity with a hierarchy rating system, like a five out of 10,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll give you the actual fault or faults. It might be a bad roller bearing in addition to an imbalance. It should also tell you the repair recommendation based on whatever faults it finds. That is why the system is so useful to plant managers; they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to get into all the details. The system automatically does that for them by simply presenting credible information upon which they can base their decisions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real dollars-and-cents gains of utilizing PdM software come from employing these systems to continuously evaluate machine conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With continuous monitoring, an engineer can keep a much closer eye on operations, which brings about the real savings of predictive maintenance,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;For example, there always will be a small percentage of machines, say 4 to 5 percent, where you can see that it is not even going to last six months down the road. So you had better take care of any problems immediately. On the other hand, the most common thing we note is that most machines are running just fine. That&amp;rsquo;s important, because without such predictive information a lot of people would tear down the machine every three years just based on the calendar. But the PdM software would indicate that this machine is still doing fine; no repairs are needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains in integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While maintenance success stories rely on ever-more powerful data collection and process tools, the breakthrough benefits result from the integration of this important maintenance data into one seamless source of concise information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Voyager is an integrated environment that combines vibration analysis, used-lubricant analysis, infrared thermography libraries and even visual inspections (input via portable data collection instruments) to provide a single view of the maintenance status of a plant&amp;rsquo;s machinery. By utilizing one common platform to combine and compare various data sources, a cross-technology scoring can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This yields a prioritized ranking so that facility managers can schedule plant-wide repairs in order of urgency. Reports can be customized to include detailed plots and images to justify comprehensive, program-management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integration of PdM software recently proved itself at Tri-State Generation &amp;amp; Transmission&amp;rsquo;s Escalante generation station. Azima&amp;rsquo;s vibration diagnostic software, ExpertALERT for Voyager (EAV), recently saved Tri-State money by taking machines out of service for necessary repairs based on their condition instead of waiting until they fail, but it was the thorough dissemination of this information that helped make the program a success, according to Joe DeSoto, a results specialist at Tri-State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The DLI Diagnostic Data Collector includes EAV on a tablet-style computer platform that you can take out of the office,&amp;rdquo; says DeSoto. &amp;ldquo;It shows your maintenance people what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the machine in real time and helps explain where the problem is and why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeSoto stresses that providing such information on the production floor is crucial to gaining the confidence of the maintenance staff. Showing them ExpertALERT&amp;rsquo;s diagnostic capabilities in action helped develop trust in the tool throughout the facility and boosted the credibility of the entire PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All hardware products should use a common software and database platform, so they can pass along and process information seamlessly,&amp;rdquo; suggests Lofall. &amp;ldquo;However, establishing common lines of communication with the business system of any given plant is becoming just as important. This type of information-distribution is now expected in the very latest iterations of PdM software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In essence, the latest PdM communication tools excel at &amp;ldquo;bringing the mountain to Mohammed&amp;rdquo; by abstracting data from insular condition monitoring applications, and then placing it at the feet of maintenance decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rsquo;s new networking technologies offer more power and transparency,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;XML, OPC and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DCOM and .NET are breaking down the barriers of integration and distributed computing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, in conjunction with diagnostic software, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s online software permits facility managers to ascertain the status of wired machinery simply by logging onto their network to view real-time vibration data or obtain a complete diagnostic analysis. Under such topology, the online system is simply another node on the plant&amp;rsquo;s LAN. An Active-X component can even be installed on selected computers so that maintenance alert messages automatically pop-up on the screen. Additionally, electronic &amp;ldquo;in-trays&amp;rdquo; can be configured so that only the status of critical, process machines will be delivered to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Connectivity is a big part of making PdM pay for itself, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to have the information unless it gets to the right people,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Certainly, the bulk of managers still get written reports, but now we have the technology to send results over the Internet and through electronic wireless connections like digital cell phones and pagers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking things a step further, Azima DLI offers a unique means of distributing maintenance information by automatically generating machine status summaries in HTML, so that these pages can be accessed via a common Web browser. This allows a traveling engineer to determine machine status, even from outside the company WAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern PdM communication software also allows a significant amount of customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s systems, you could get the condition of a machine right on your digital pager or cell phone with a text message,&amp;rdquo; adds Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Or, you could set it up so that your cell phone would ring every time a machine of your particular interest, reached a critical state of maintenance need. To go another step further, different ring tones can be assigned to different incoming numbers, so an engineer can immediately tell which piece of equipment needs attention. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a matter of preference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These improvements in communication are even becoming available to small organizations that lack integrated business systems. Azima DLI, for instance, operates an online monitoring center on a 24/7 basis, providing worldwide coverage of wired machines. The monitoring program can be set up to deliver maintenance information over a wide range of time frames, from monthly reports all the way to immediate-alert messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	And so, the story of PdM has come a long way from the early days of RTF. Innovative PdM tools now help engineers accurately track the condition of their assets, whether they&amp;rsquo;re using a stand-alone PC system in a small job shop or an enterprise-wide system for a multi-plant industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Kulczak summed up the modern state of affairs when he observed, &amp;ldquo;RTF is not only just a memory, but an impossibility here. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t afford to do that. For us, PdM software proved to be a very useful tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because today&amp;rsquo;s modern PdM systems enable increased uptime, energy savings, and reduced maintenance costs for organizations of all sizes, it has earned recognition as a contributor to profitability. Those plant engineers who have taken the next step from time-based or reactive drills to proactive condition-based planning on both existing and newequipment, are laying the groundwork for even further advances within the field of maintenance management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>FLIR HD thermal imaging system captures environmental disasters</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	FLIR Systems Inc. on May 13 released electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) footage from recent environmental disasters including the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull, and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Footage and additional images can be viewed at &lt;a href="http://www.gs.flir.com/disaster/" target="_newbrowser"&gt;http://www.gs.flir.com/disaster/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recording the footage was the Star SAFIRE HD from the company&amp;#39;s Pilatus PC-12. The Star SAFIRE HD is the world&amp;#39;s first and only all-digital, all-high definition (HD) EO/IR surveillance system. The system serves as the eyes for aircraft in reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, law enforcement and environmental protection missions for governments, militaries and defense communities across the globe. It was designed to record high-quality footage day or night, in some of the harshest environments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This footage demonstrates FLIR&amp;#39;s ability to aid in a variety of missions, allowing first-responders to have eyes looking into the middle of the disaster,&amp;quot; said William A. Sundermeier, president of FLIR Government Systems. &amp;quot;The same technologies that are currently protecting our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are equally effective in these global disasters, by enhancing the understanding and reaction time during the most unforeseen circumstances.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Although these systems provide breathtaking daylight color images, real-world rescues and crisis response operations usually take place at night or in adverse weather conditions,&amp;quot; said Sundermeier. &amp;quot;We weigh this heavily when developing our technology to ensure crisp and clear images at night when EO/IR systems are most imperative.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The footage that was recorded off the Gulf Coast was utilized by the U.S. Coast Guard to more thoroughly evaluate the severity of the spill. FLIR began collaborating with the Coast Guard in 1984, and today their systems are on USCG helicopters, aircraft and ships, and are widely used within the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Poll finds challenges with PdM sustainability can overshadow successes </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on April 1 announced the results of a survey aimed at gaining insight into the state of predictive maintenance and condition monitoring programs among U.S. plants. Overall findings show that while a majority (76 percent) of respondents is satisfied with current programs, more than half of those surveyed agree that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know exactly what solutions and tools are needed to maintain a successful program. Combined with insufficient staff, limited in-house expertise and poor training as the top factors negatively impacting results, plants must re-examine existing programs now in order to ensure sustainability and the ability to meet long-term productivity and reliability goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The findings of Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s inaugural &amp;ldquo;State of the Condition Monitoring Industry&amp;rdquo; report are based on a survey conducted among engineers and plant managers. Of those surveyed, 65 percent have a machine condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place. The top three components of those programs are vibration analysis/monitoring, lube oil analysis and thermography. Of those who don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a program in place, 16 percent plan to start one this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reaching the C-Suite&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While the majority of respondents agree that predictive maintenance programs directly impact the bottom line, when queried about barriers to success, difficulty demonstrating ROI was one of the top factors. This could be directly related to other issues such as insufficient staff and limited budget support, but nonetheless, ROI remains an important measure of program traction that resonates with the C-suite. Therefore, plants must adopt the right technology and partner services to enable managers to better capture and report the benefits of condition monitoring programs, focusing on metrics such as decreased downtime, improved productivity, and cost savings related to improved equipment health and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outsourcing Predicted to Rise&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For those with a condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place, just over half of the respondents use a combination of in-house and outsourced solutions. While only 8 percent currently outsourcing data collection and analysis, based on this survey, outsourcing may be on the rise. Of those handling programs in-house, 53 percent responded that they believe there are benefits to outsourcing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In considering a partner for third-party support, the following factors were ranked, in order of importance, as most influential in making that decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analytical software and services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ability to speak with a customer service representative 24/7&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Advanced reporting capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Web-based or on-demand access to data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;While the benefits of an effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance program are clear to plant personnel and management, many programs have been left on auto-pilot during tight economic times,&amp;rdquo; said Burt Hurlock, CEO, Azima DLI. &amp;ldquo;We believe one of the keys to long-term success is greater visibility among the C-suite regarding the quantifiable impact these programs can have on productivity and plants&amp;rsquo; ability to comply with important industry standards for reliability. For example, by investing in cost-effective data collection analysis capabilities, plants can make informed maintenance decisions and generate results in terms of cost-avoidance related to unscheduled downtime and unnecessary repairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Detecting material accumulation in equipment with infrared</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared technology is one of the most important tools that can be used in a successful predictive maintenance program. This technology is not just for finding abnormalities with electrical components and equipment based on elevated temperature; it can also find potential problems based on lower-than-normal temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The capabilities of an infrared imager are limited to the imagination of the thermographer. There are many potential problems that can be identified with infrared for which you may not be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Locating material buildup in baghouse hoppers, coke gas lines and flue gas ducts are a few instances where you are not looking for the hottest temperature, but instead, the coolest. As long as there is a differential in temperature between the buildup of material and the gas passing through the equipment, you should be able to visually see the material through the lens of the infrared camera. If the differential in temperature is small, avoid sunny days when the selected equipment is located outdoors to avoid errors in the temperature readings from reflections and solar gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken011.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The example above is a baghouse in a steel mill. It is collecting the emissions from a ladle refining unit. There is a 20-degree Fahrenheit differential temperature between (Sp1) purple (the material buildup) and (Sp2) white (the gas stream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solid materials&amp;rsquo; presence is quite noticeable as witnessed by the&amp;nbsp;lower temperature in the bottom section. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken012.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This example represents a large-diameter duct elbow transferring gas and metal&amp;nbsp;particulates from an EAF furnace to a baghouse. There is a 30-degree Fahrenheit temperature difference between (Sp1) purple (the material buildup) and (Sp2) white (the gas stream), demonstrating considerable accumulation of debris in the duct.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two examples clearly show that solid material is present in both. This not only restricts the air flow through the equipment and can affect production, it also adds considerable weight to the structure that it may not be designed to withstand.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On a day last month, in the early morning hours, I embarked on the scheduled task of inspecting the miles of power lines that are strung throughout the chemical plant in Central Florida where I work as a reliability analyst. The task was simple. I was to perform an infrared and ultrasound inspection on the high-voltage power line connections, disconnects, fuses and transformers, as well as the electrical equipment and components, located in nine substations throughout the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I started on the southeast side of the plant and worked my way northwest toward the two steam turbine generators that were supplying several plants as well as the public power grid with an approximate combined load of 59 megawatts (MW) at 69 kilovolts (KV) that morning. I found several small problems working my way around, including a few high-voltage components with corona activity present that I observed and recorded with the ultrasound equipment as well as a faulty connection at a fuse clip on a high-voltage line supplying power to a processing plant that I observed and captured with an infrared camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then I saw something strange with my own eyes. Just two power poles away from the first turbine was a bright red line above my head. At approximately 5:30 a.m., I found myself in the dark, spinning in a circle, looking up, down and all around, visually trying to figure out where the reflection was coming from. Then it hit me! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reflection. I could visually see the 69 KV power line glowing bright red in the dark.&amp;nbsp;Stepping back away from the pole, I viewed it on the IR camera from what I felt was a relatively safe distance and angle, just in case the line decided to break and fall in my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ardekani001.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the center phase jumper, I observed a pretty apparent inaccurate temperature of approximately 312 degrees Fahrenheit. That reading was due to being out of my measurable field of view with a Delta T of 228&amp;deg;F and another anomaly that was not seen visually with an inaccurate temperature of approximately 137&amp;deg;F with a Delta T of 57&amp;deg;F on the lower phase. Undeterred by the inaccurate measurements, I still saved the image. At the time, I believed that the temperature of the center phase jumper must have been at least 800&amp;deg;F in order for it to produce the bright red glow that was visually present. I also snapped a visual picture in an attempt to capture an image of the line glowing in the dark. I immediately informed the production manager in charge of the turbines and escorted him to the pole so he could see for himself that it was glowing. After his visual conformation, he informed his superiors immediately of the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few hours of discovering the fault, plant reliability engineers, maintenance planners and the plant electrical superintendent had a plan in place to perform an unscheduled power outage and repair the connections immediately in an effort to avoid the additional cost that would be incurred if the plants were to shut down abruptly without any notice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The power line that was isolated was leaving one of the steam-driven turbines carrying a load of approximately 34 MW at 69 KV when the fault was discovered. It supplied power to the local power company&amp;rsquo;s grid as well as six different processing plants, administrative offices and one maintenance shop. All of them were shut down unscheduled but were given enough notice to reduce any additional cost of corrective measures that would have needed to take place had the plants gone down without the proper procedures and protocols being followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon shutdown, the high-voltage electricians discovered the connections on the jumper that had been glowing were so damaged that the entire line length had to be replaced from one pole to the other. The initial investigation indicated an improper compression connecter was used to splice the jumper to the line going to the next pole. The connector was sized for the gauge of wire used between the two poles; however, the jumper was of a smaller gauge, thus making a weak connection. This was headed for catastrophic failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The faults were reassessed the following morning after the proper corrective measures were taken. The Delta T on both faults was reduced to within 5&amp;deg;F under approximately the same load, ambient and surrounding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/2TPfbChmIpk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ULIS to give talk on advances in uncooled infrared detectors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ULIS, a leading infrared vision specialist making affordable uncooled thermal sensors for civilian and military applications, announced March 5 that it will give a presentation on the advances in uncooled infrared detectors at the SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing symposium, April 5-9, in Orlando, Fla. These devices, also called microbolometers, are paving the way for high-definition IR products (VGA and XGA &amp;ndash; video graphics arrays) and smaller, compact formats. SPIE is the international society advancing optronics and light-based research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing 2010 is one of the defense &amp;amp; security industry&amp;#39;s leading meetings for light-based applications, and brings together top researchers, scientists and engineers from the military, industry and academia. Programs cover the latest enabling technologies and applications in infrared, sensors, image analysis, and other systems and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are focusing on reducing the pixel pitch, enhancing the high spatial resolution and lowering the power consumption of our uncooled IR detectors. We and our customers believe that this turns the TEC-less 17-micron pixel size VGA array into a product well-adapted for high resolution and compact systems, such as portable cameras or systems for commercial and military applications,&amp;quot; said Jean-Luc Tissot technical director at ULIS. &amp;quot;Every year, this SPIE forum throws a spotlight on new ideas and knowledge and we are glad to be taking a lead part in this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As co-chair, Tissot will open the session on &amp;quot;Uncooled FPAs and Applications&amp;quot;. He will then go on to present &amp;quot;High performance uncooled amorphous silicon VGA IRFPA with 17-micron pixel-pitch&amp;quot;, a technical paper he co-authored with ULIS&amp;#39; research and development team. The paper takes a close look at the high electro-optical performances of this IRFPA (Infrared Focal Planar Array) and the rapid performance enhancements ULIS has achieved. Tissot will discuss the NETD trade-offs with wide thermal dynamic range, as well as the high uniformity characteristics and pixel operability that the company has accomplished through its thorough knowledge of amorphous silicon technology coupled with the ROIC (readout integrated circuit) design. Tissot says this technology node paves the way for high-end products, as well as compact smaller formats like 320 x 240 or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ULIS uses special semiconductor compound material, amorphous silicon, to make its microbolometers. Amorphous silicon enables the development of high performance technologies and has the advantage of being able to be mass-produced, since silicon manufacturing is well established as an industrial process.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the large volumes of microbolometers ULIS produces can lower the cost per unit and open up applications in market sectors where infrared cameras and system need to be more affordable, such as cameras for thermography, surveillance or enhanced night vision driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About ULIS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ULIS, a subsidiary of Sofradir, specializes in the design and manufacture of innovative, high-quality uncooled microbolometers for thermography, automotive, safety and military applications. It enables makers of infrared equipment to produce low-weight, low-power consumption and cost-effective infrared cameras in large volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/R3P2uvsUG1g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>White roofs may successfully cool cities</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Painting the roofs of buildings white has the potential to significantly cool off cities and mitigate some impacts of global warming, results of a new study indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The research, the first computer modeling study to simulate the impacts of white roofs on urban areas worldwide, suggests there may be merit to the idea of turning roofs white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the study team, led by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo., cautions that there are still many hurdles between the concept and actual use of white roofs to counteract rising temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our research demonstrates that white roofs, at least in theory, can be an effective method for reducing urban heat,&amp;quot; says NCAR scientist Keith Oleson, the lead scientist on the study. &amp;quot;It remains to be seen if it&amp;#39;s actually feasible for cities to paint their roofs white, but the idea certainly warrants further investigation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Results of the research are slated for publication later this winter in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) journal &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The work was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NCAR&amp;#39;s sponsor. &amp;quot;Climate change mitigation research is an extremely important topic,&amp;quot; says Steve Nelson, NSF program director for NCAR. &amp;quot;Whether on white roofs or other climate change mitigation subjects, it&amp;#39;s important to consider the many feedbacks and complicating considerations that make research in this area very complex.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change because they are warmer than outlying rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asphalt roads, tar roofs and other artificial surfaces absorb heat from the sun, creating an urban &amp;quot;heat island effect&amp;quot; that can raise temperatures on average by 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1 to 3 degrees Celsius) or more, compared to rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	White roofs would reflect some of that heat back into space and cool temperatures, much as wearing a white shirt on a sunny day can be cooler than wearing a dark shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study team used a newly developed computer model to simulate the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed or reflected by urban surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The model simulations, which provide scientists with an idealized view of different types of cities around the world, indicate that, if every roof were entirely painted white, the urban heat island effect could be reduced by 33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This would cool the world&amp;#39;s cities by an average of about 0.7 F, with the cooling influence being particularly pronounced during the day, especially in summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The authors emphasize that their research should be viewed as a hypothetical look at typical city landscapes rather than the actual rooftops of any one city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the real world, the cooling impact might be somewhat less because dust and weathering would cause the white paint to darken over time and parts of roofs would remain unpainted because of openings such as heating and cooling vents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, white roofs would have the effect of cooling temperatures within buildings. As a result, depending on the local climate, the amount of energy used for space heating and air conditioning could change, which could affect both outside air temperatures and the consumption of fossil fuels such as oil and coal that are associated with global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on whether air conditioning or heating is affected more, this could either magnify or partially offset the impact of the roofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not as simple as just painting roofs white and cooling off a city,&amp;quot; Oleson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The research indicated that some cities would benefit more than others from white roofs, depending on such factors as the city&amp;#39;s location and design. Among the factors to be considered are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Roof density. Cities where roofs are packed closely together would cool more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Construction. Roofs that allow large amounts of heat from the sun to penetrate the interior of a building (as can happen with metal roofs and little insulation) are less effective in cooling outside temperatures when painted white.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Location. White roofs tend to have a larger impact in relatively warm climates that receive strong, year-round sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the model did not have enough detail to capture individual cities, it did show the change in temperatures in larger metropolitan regions. The New York area, for example, would cool in summer afternoons by almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study team used a new computer model, developed by Oleson and colleagues, that is designed to assess the impacts of a changing climate on urban populations and explore options for countering rising temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This urban canyon model simulates temperature changes in city landscapes, capturing such factors as the influence of roofs, walls, streets, and green spaces on local temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oleson has successfully linked the urban canyon model to a computer simulation of worldwide climate, the NCAR-based Community Climate System Model, thereby enabling researchers to study the interactions between global climate change and urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new model does not yet have the power to replicate the architecture and design of specific cities. Instead, the research team created abstractions of cities in the model, using classes of population density, urban design and building construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oleson and his colleagues plan to continue refining the model to provide more information for policymakers concerned about protecting urban populations from the risks associated with heat waves and other changes in climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s critical to understand how climate change will affect vulnerable urban areas, which are home to most of the world&amp;#39;s population,&amp;quot; says NCAR scientist Gordon Bonan, a co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering. In fiscal year (FY) 2010, its budget is about $6.9 billion. NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 universities and institutions. Each year, NSF receives over 45,000 competitive requests for funding, and makes over 11,500 new funding awards. NSF also awards over $400 million in professional and service contracts yearly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Leveraging the power of IR cameras for condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared technology can detect subtle variations in motors, pumps, conveyors and other machine components. For decades, portable, infrared cameras have provided non-contact temperature measurement on a constantly expanding list of applications. Infrared technology provides real-time analysis of entire &amp;ldquo;scenes&amp;rdquo; allowing for quick and safe monitoring. Infrared technology is an accepted and credited maintenance technology generally considered to offer the best return on investment of predictive maintenance tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The numbers of infrared cameras in the field have increased dramatically over the last 10 years. Technology improvements have opened the doors to potential infrared users who never considered infrared cameras in the past due to cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an increasing base of infrared users and applications, the challenge is to leverage the technology effectively. Proper use of infrared technology requires an understanding of the components and the fundamentals of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Infrared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared energy is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and behaves similarly to visible light. It travels through space at the speed of light and can be reflected, refracted, absorbed and emitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="330" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis01.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which is longer in wavelength than light. Other types of electromagnetic radiation are X-rays, ultraviolet rays and visible light. Infrared detectors or systems are categorized by their wavelength. The unit of measurement is the micron. For example, a system that can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; from 8 to 12 microns is considered a longwave, infrared camera because it &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo; in the longer side of the infrared spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All objects emit infrared energy as a function of their temperature. This means all objects emit infrared radiation. Infrared energy is generated by the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules. The higher the temperature of an object, the more the motion and hence the more infrared energy emitted. The cameras do not see temperature, they detect thermal radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="332" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis02.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Petronas Towers&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E+T+R=1 &amp;ndash; Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No IR camera reads temperature directly. IR cameras read the IR energy coming from a target which includes: E emitted, T transmitted and R reflected energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we discussed earlier, all targets emit energy. The infrared radiation that is emitted by a target is dependent on two things: the absolute temperature of a body and the emissivity of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Emissivity &lt;/strong&gt;is a material property. It is the efficiency of the body as a radiator or emitter. In our world, emissivity might be defined as the ability of an object to absorb infrared energy. We calculate emissivity as a property set by a number from 0 to 1. 0 would be a perfect R, or reflector &amp;ndash; all energy that strikes the target with a 0 emissivity would bounce off of it. Any object with an emissivity of 1 would be a perfect absorber &amp;ndash; all energy that strikes the target with a 1 emissivity would be absorbed. Neither example exists in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to note the emissivity is not a set number. It is a material surface property and is affected by shape, viewing angle, wavelength and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reflectivity&lt;/strong&gt;,in our case, is infrared energy that bounces off our target. Reflectivity defines the energy on a target that was not emitted by the target itself. Often defined as Tref or Tamb in cameras, it is the temperature of incident radiation from the target&amp;rsquo;s surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Transmissivity &lt;/strong&gt;of a material is the percentage of infrared radiation that transmitted through it. For example, glass has poor transmissivity in the longwave, infrared spectrum. Thus, infrared camera manufacturers often use Germanium for their lenses. Germanium has almost perfect transmissivity in the longwave, infrared spectrum. When dealing with infrared systems, spec sheets, salespeople, users, etc., will often only address the issue of emissivity. However, emissivity is only one-third of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we are interested in temperature measurement, we must realize only the sum of an object&amp;rsquo;s emittance, transmittance and reflectivity will get us to the complete number 1 and, for our work here, an accurate temperature measurement.Remember, E+T+R =1 gives us our best chance for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spot size ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another important factor when considering measurement is spot size ratio. Spot size ratio is the ability of an infrared camera to measure an object from a given distance. Infrared systems have to average a certain number of pixels together to calculate an actual temperature. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="300" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis03.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cross hair, or Spot 1, in the above image has a circle in the middle. The circle represents the number of pixels that are averaged together to create a temperature reading. Any object we want to measure has to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; inside this circle. If our target does not completely fill the circle, we know we will be finding average surrounding components, and, thus, temperatures around our target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spot size is usually represented as a ratio. For example, an infrared system with an approx. 20&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo; spot size ratio can measure a 1-inch object from 20 feet away. Remember, a spot size ratio is a ratio. As we move closer or further away from the target are spot size ratio will grow correspondingly smaller or larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pixel count and optics play a large part in determining the spot size ratio of an infrared system. For example, if we assume the same optics for three systems with different pixel counts, 160x120, 320x240, and 640x480, we will have significantly different spot size ratios. The larger the pixel count, the smaller or more densely packaged the pixels on the detector. The more pixels we can get on a smaller target, the better our spot size ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, below are three images saved by three different systems. The images were taken from the same distance with approximately the same optic configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Notice the maximum temperature in scene results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	160x120 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 127 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	320x240 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 243 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	640x480 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 280 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As our spot size ratio increased, we are measuring a smaller and smaller point and, thus, measuring a more accurate hot spot. In fact, we can actually see an impending problem on the 640x480 image that we could not see in the other images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A telephoto optic improves the spot size ratio of an infrared camera by narrowing the field of view. By tightening the pixels into a narrower field of view, we can place more pixels on a target and improve our accuracy. For example, a spot size ratio of a 160x120 infrared system with a standard, 25 degree lens is approximately 10&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo;. If we use a telephoto, 12-degree lens in place of the 25-degree lens, our spot size ratio improves to 20&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo; despite the fact we are using the exact same camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, by using a narrow field of lens, we have doubled the amount of area we have to scan. An argument for higher resolution cameras is that we can often use standard lenses with wider field of views and still measure small components from distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Over-emphasizing Temperature Measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ever since the introduction of radiometric systems there has been a tendency to rely on temperature measurements as an indicator of component operability. NETA and others have generated &amp;ldquo;equipment severity ratings&amp;rdquo; based on temperature. Therefore, through training and subsequent research, infrared thermographers have become accustomed to providing temperature measurements in their reports. However, a large issue for &amp;ldquo;temperature measurement&amp;rdquo; is whether that measurement is meaningful or not. For example, let us consider a relatively small, apparent, Delta T between two battery studs. In our example, the temperature of the bad stud is 119 F, +/- 3F. Under most common severity guidelines, this would be classified as a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The important information regarding this component is not necessarily the temperature but the electric current (load) running through it. The battery stud is hot due to high resistance. At the time of measurement, the battery was being trickle charged 60 milliamps (MA). The battery was rated for 200 amps. Ignoring the fact that the resistance and heat transfer will increase with temperature, a simple ration of the power dissipated at a load of 200 amps, the connection would dissipate about 11 million times the power it is in the images. This would cause a failure that we would have missed! The load (current) is one example of a crucial factor in electrical system analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Ignoring temperature measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since we have just discussed relying too much on temperature information, we should consider the inverse. What if we only relied on qualitative finding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, measurement of a hot conductor indicates a hot spot at the connection. Common methodology would indicate that the corrective action is to clean and tighten the connection. This may solve the connection problem but is the connection problem the whole story. Measurement tells us in this example that the conductor temperature is 115 degrees Celsius, at or above the temperature limit on the cable insulation. The insulation has degraded to the point where new conductors must be pulled to correct the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantitative thermography is essential when equipment temperature limits are approached. There are many other examples where quantitative measurements are required such as diagnosing steam traps, safety relief valves or determining corrective action priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Misidentification of components&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The many hats that infrared thermographers have to wear include the hat that says &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Whether you like it or not, you are considered the expert in whatever you are looking at with your IR camera. It is very tough for a non-electrical person to identify electrical components. There is no excuse for not correctly identifying components yet this is done every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sources for the correct identification of components include plant personnel such as mechanics, electricians, technicians as well as engineers, management, equipment operation manuals and the industry groups on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IR is an extremely useful predictive maintenance tool. By learning more about infrared properties and how infrared cameras operate, we can learn how to more effectively apply the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to manage a multi-technology condition monitoring program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Managing a multi-technology condition monitoring program at a large mining operation was a challenging task, especially when there has been a cultural shift required to integrate the ideas of condition monitoring into an already complex maintenance strategy. One of the major challenges included shifting the focus of an experienced maintenance crew from a run-to-failure mentality to a proactive mentality. Another major challenge was folding the new work practices into the current work flow model, one which didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of emphasis on backlogged maintenance items. Finally, coaching the supervision and management about why this is the right move proved to be one of the more difficult tasks of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now less than a year later, dramatic results are being realized. As the condition monitoring statistics trend in the right direction, maintenance costs are shifting sharply as well. Overtime has dropped, and unplanned downtime has decreased significantly. The best part is the workforce is becoming more and more focused on fixing problems rather than fixing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This paper will share some of the stories and many of the measures that made this shift possible. In addition, some of the software tools and work flow models that helped drive the measures and decision making processes will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine is a large, open-pit mining operation located 25 miles south of Lakeland, Fla. Four Corners is one of six mines belonging to The Mosaic Corporation, the world&amp;rsquo;s 13th-largest producer of phosphate fertilizer. The Four Corners Mine produces approximately 6.5 million tons of phosphate rock annually. The mine has three distinct areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dragline Operations: Electric draglines are used for mineral extraction. There are six draglines averaging 50 cubic yards each.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field Pumping System: 82 large 2,000-horsepower pumps are used to move the unprocessed phosphate rock (matrix) from the draglines to the float plant. This makes for nearly 70 miles of 20-inch and 22-inch pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Float Plant: The float plant includes numerous conveyors, vibrating screens, pumps and log washers that are all used to clean the phosphate rock and separate the debris and unwanted material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told there are 775 pieces of rotating equipment on the entire facility. There are 270 employees at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four Corners Mine, with 110 of them in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine embarked on the implementation of a multi-technology condition monitoring program in March 2005 and has seen some very dramatic changes take place since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand the Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were and still remain several large challenges to getting the process completely ironed out. Like any process that involves more than one person, the relationships between the people play a vital role in continued success. Each of the individuals has to develop a level of trust in the others and as a group they have to develop a unified sense of purpose. Finding and retaining qualified personnel is another large challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring personnel who want to work in a mining environment and have any experience at all are very difficult to come by. As everyone begins to work together on a daily basis attitudes and personalities start to play major roles in the group&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping all these technical people working and working together can prove to be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key challenges is developing an understanding of the process between the maintenance group and condition monitoring group. The maintenance people have to understand the condition monitoring process, and the condition monitoring people have to understand the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without each fully grasping the other&amp;rsquo;s process and where they themselves fit into the other process, any kind of forward momentum will be difficult to initiate. Finally, internal group politics can play a large role in extinguishing improvements in the overall process. If there are individuals who tend to not give credit where credit is due, hard feelings can develop. On the other hand, if the leaders of the change process are quick to hand out pats on the back and do it often, then everyone feels they are appreciated and tend to work even harder to advance the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desire to Succeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key role in the success of any process is a strong desire to succeed. That desire is easily seen at the Four Corners Mine. The maintenance manager is the catalyst that keeps the program rolling on a daily basis. The manager&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward condition monitoring as a part of the overall maintenance strategy is what keeps the rest of the maintenance department focused. Above the maintenance manager, in the corporate office, the desire for the program to succeed is seen as well. The benefits of the condition monitoring program have been folded into the overall financial strategy of the mining operations at the Mosaic operations of central Florida. The condition monitoring program is expected to produce results in the safety, costs and availability areas of the overall plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety measures have been affected by means of reduced overtime and call-out work. When crafts personnel are not called out as much at night to work on equipment that has failed during a scheduled production shift, the likelihood for injury has been reduced. When the precise nature of a problem has been identified prior to work commencing and the craftsmen don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend unnecessary time and effort looking for the problem, the likelihood for injury has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being able to identify problems and get them corrected long before additional damage happens to other components of a machine reduces the overall cost of the repair. All of these add up to reduced unplanned downtime which is increased machinery availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Technology vs. Asset Ranking Graph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multi-technology Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine decided early to employ as many condition monitoring technologies as they could to provide the highest likelihood of identifying the actual failure modes of the assets. Vibration analysis, contact ultrasonic emissions, oil analysis and mechanical infrared thermography were chosen to identify rotating machinery defects. Motor circuit analysis and electrical infrared thermography were chosen to identify the failure modes of the electric motors and the associated switchgear. See Figure 1 for the percentage of coverage by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Technology Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mosaic Company also decided early on that an investment in the best technology available would help ensure the best results. CSI 2130s were chosen as the vibration analysis platform. Mikron infrared cameras were chosen for the thermography effort. The UE Systems 10,000 was selected for contact and airborne ultrasonic analysis. And, the venerable PdMA MCE/Emax was selected as the motor circuit analyzer of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="342" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon02.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Integrated Condition Status Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web-based Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Web-based reporting platform is used to communicate the results of all condition monitoring technologies to Mosaic personnel. A Web-based reporting tool was selected for numerous reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It requires no software to be installed on customer&amp;rsquo;s computers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It can be accessed from any computer with access to the World Wide Web.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is not limited to any particular hardware or software platform for the different technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is easily expandable as other technologies are added or removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mosaic wants all levels of supervision to be involved in the identification and elimination of machinery faults. Consequently everyone has access to the software. Figure 2 shows an example of a report available in the software that summarizes all of the problems identified in a given area of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated Work Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A fully integrated work flow model would be defined as one where both the Mosaic personnel and the Allied Reliability personnel had equal ownership in getting the work identified and accomplished. Figure 3 shows the work flow model, which is color-coded to quickly identify who is responsible for which part of the process. It was decided that this integrated workflow would provide the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get Mosaic and Allied interacting on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure Mosaic personnel took ownership of certain portions of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technician can make clear recommendations not just alert the customer to the technical aspects of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interaction at the lowest level creates a learning process for both the technician and the craftsmen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The &amp;ldquo;Post Check&amp;rdquo; is the feedback loop for the maintenance repair process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Relationship between the technician, supervisor and mechanic &amp;hellip; crucial for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="307" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon03.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Four Corners &amp;ndash; Condition Monitoring Work Flow Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was agreed that workforce education was an important foundational element that would keep the process going. Four Corners continues to make a significant effort to educate all maintenance employees about P-F intervals (see Figure 4). In addition, technology familiarization was also a major topic. Making all of the front-line supervisors and craftsmen aware of the different condition monitoring technologies and how they worked was seen as a key component of gaining acceptance. The reliability engineers conduct monthly &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions where sandwiches are brought in and key program elements and/or technology demonstrations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="256" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon04.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. P-F Interval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a dedicated focus, it is very easy to lose sight of the goal. To ensure this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, Four Corners dedicated a good portion of the reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s time to overseeing the process. Their goal is to maintain maintenance engagement and awareness while at the same time measuring and benchmarking the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s results and success as well as Allied Reliability&amp;rsquo;s. Successes are purposely celebrated at weekly meetings and misses are clearly identified and root causes eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon05.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. MTBF &amp;ndash; Motor Failures (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The entire process must be inundated with an attitude of constant improvement, and at Four Corners, it is. The maintenance manager is always pushing for more and better results. The reliability engineers are always pushing for more detailed explanations of problems and more focus on eliminating root causes. In an effort to help maintain this focus, Allied Reliability provides Four Corners with a monthly report on numerous measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Red, Yellow and Green Condition Entries, both overall and by technology&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Condition Entries Implemented&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Work Orders Generated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Route Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average Time to Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-world Measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are three graphs representing the effect that Four Corners&amp;rsquo; attitude toward constant improvement and condition monitoring has had since March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Infrared cameras help determine presence of water on moon</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Images provided by innovative short wave infrared (SWIR) cameras from Goodrich Corporation's ISR Systems team in Princeton, N.J. provided preliminary data that NASA scientists used to determine the presence of water on the moon. During a historic mission on October 9, 2009, a NASA rocket was launched into a crater near the moon's south pole; images from the SWIR cameras showed evidence of water in the post-crash debris plume.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The lunar crash was part of NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission to search for water on the moon. Two Goodrich SWIR â referred to by NASA as "near infrared" â cameras were part of the payload aboard the spacecraft, along with the Centaur rocket that was hurled onto the moon's surface. Images of the vapor and debris plume created by the rocket's impact were recorded by the SWIR cameras, and were analyzed to determine the presence of water on the moon.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Because the Goodrich SWIR cameras detect moisture contrast through dust, smoke and fog, they were able to accurately record the LCROSS crash incident for precise study of the debris cloud. SWIR technology detects reflected light at wavelengths that the human eye cannot see, in wavelength bands between visible and thermal cameras.

            <title>NASA plants MIRICLE thermal imaging camera on moon </title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;History was made on Friday, October 9, when NASA sent not one but two spacecraft hurtling into the surface of the moon, leaving a Thermoteknix miniature thermal imaging camera permanently embedded in its own lunar crater. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;At 12.30 BST, a 2,200-kilogram Centaur rocket stage slammed into the moon in a flurry of lunar dust, followed shortly after by a second unmanned spacecraft containing an array of sensors including a Thermoteknix MIRICLE TB2-30 infrared camera to record the impact. The Thermoteknix camera detected a minute flash of heat as the Centaur hit the moon, confirming the moment of impact and recording the temperature rise as a new crater was formed. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Moments later the LCROSS instrument spacecraft impacted close by, creating its own smaller crater. Data from the dust cloud was beamed back live from the LCROSS spacecraft to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) for onward transmission back to Earth. Scientists at Mission Control NASA in Ames, Calif., were ecstatic with the unique data which will be invaluable in subsequent analysis to confirm or refute the presence of water in this section of the lunar landscape. An array of more than 15 observatories around the earth were involved in observing the event, as was the Hubble telescope which closely monitored the impact and its instruments recorded spectroscopic data. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Thermoteknix MIRICLE camera, which took the first ever thermal images of the far side of the Moon just days before, performed flawlessly throughout the mission up to its impact with the moon.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Anthony Colaprete, LCROSS principal investigator and project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, said "The LCROSS science instruments worked exceedingly well and returned a wealth of data that will greatly improve our understanding of our closest celestial neighbor. The team is excited to dive into data." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;It will be some days until NASA can confirm whether water is actually present following this historic achievement which saw the LCROSS satellite travel 5.6 million miles in 113 days before heading into the permanently shadowed 100 kilometers wide Cabeus crater near the moonâs south pole.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Finding water on the moon is not only important for supporting prolonged manned visits to the moon but will also allow the production of rocket fuel for venturing further into space.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Dr. Richard Salisbury, managing director of Thermoteknix, said: "We are delighted to have successfully played such a critical part in NASA's epic mission to find water on the Moon, which is vital for the future of long-term space exploration and we are all very proud of this achievement." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;MIRICLE TB2-30 is the same camera which has already been used on Formula 1 and IndyCar racecars and most recently in several highly successful âAegisâ Ballistic Missile Defence tests. The MIRICLE radiometric aerospace qualified system is calibrated for temperature measurement in the harshest of environments under the most extreme vibration conditions.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Camera captures 1st thermal image of far side of moon</title>

A Thermoteknix MIRICLE TB2-30 thermal camera was launched into space aboard NASAâs LCROSS mission to search for the presence of water on the moon. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;LCROSS payload manager and chief scientist Anthony Colaprete contacted Thermoteknix to say that âthe Thermoteknix camera provided the first thermal images of the far side of the moon and also images of earth and the moon from distances as great as 560,000 and 850,000 kilometers away, respectively. The camera has work flawlessly for nearly 100 days (and counting) in interplanetary space.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;A Centaur spacecraft launched from the orbiting LCROSS craft will make a direct vertical impact into the moon on Friday, October 9, creating a huge plume of dust which will be analyzed for water by a number of different instruments including the Thermoteknix thermal camera, which will follow the Centaur down four minutes later as it impacts the moon surface. The debris plumes are expected to be visible from Earth- and space-based telescopes 10 to 12 inches and larger. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Last week, an Indian orbiter participating in NASAâs Moon water project made spectroscopic measurements of the moonâs upper atmosphere that support the possibility of sub-surface water/ice. The Centaur impact into the moon surface itself will release materials from the lunar surface that will be analyzed for the presence of hydrated minerals and will be a major step in confirming or otherwise, the existence of water on the moon. Discovering water on the moon is not only important for supporting prolonged manned visits to the moon but could potentiate the production of rocket fuel outside the earth for venturing further into space. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>FLIR, Sofradir will collaborate on dual-band military camera</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;FLIR Systems Inc., a global leader in thermal imaging, infrared (IR) cameras and night vision systems and Sofradir, a leader in advanced infrared detectors for military, aerospace and commercial applications, on October 5 announced that FLIR Systems will be collaborating with Sofradir on state-of-the-art third-generation dual-band detectors and camera cores to create thermal cameras with enhanced capabilities for military and commercial applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sofradir brings its industry-leading detector technology and mass production capacities, while FLIR will design cameras and insert them into both U.S. and international developed systems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"FLIR Systems and Sofradir share a common goal to supply the global sensor market with leading-edge technology," said Bill Sundermeier, president, FLIR Systems Government Systems division. "This relationship reinforces the confidence that our customers have in our increased technological capabilities."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We are pleased to be working side-by-side with FLIR, whose reputation for product quality is recognized worldwide," said Philippe Bensussan, chairman and CEO at Sofradir. "Together we'll be offering the best dual-band product on the market."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;This collaboration comes at a point when dual-band detectors are just beginning to become available after a long period of materials development in several countries. The applications include not only military and security imaging systems, but also thermographic and scientific cameras. This is because they provide the possibility of precise non-contact temperature measurement with automatic compensation for unknown material emissivity.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Sofradir's IR detectors are integrated into thousands of military-grade systems deployed to detect, observe, and identify objects at great distances, day and night, through fog, smoke and dust. Sofradir has introduced numerous "firsts" to the IR camera and optronics systems sector, and several of its IR detectors have set new industry standards in performance.&amp;nbsp; Those qualities will be captured in the new dual-band IR detector.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The dual-band thermal camera will operate in the midwave and longwave bandwidths, allowing users to switch spectral bands depending on the particular object to be identified or surveyed. The longwave bandwidth can optimize detection at cooler temperatures, and be beneficial on a battlefield, in the presence of dust, smoke or fog. The midwave bandwidth will enhance performance in high temperature and high humidity. The cameras will also provide for efficient image fusion between the two bands, as the images will be naturally registered.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>An intro to infrared thermography for mechanical applications</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Infrared thermography is the process of using a thermal imager to detect infrared radiation (heat) that is emitted by an object. The technology allows operators to validate normal operations and, more importantly, locate thermal anomalies (abnormal patterns of heat invisible to the eye) which indicate possible faults, defects or inefficiencies within a system or machine asset. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A few examples of where infrared is applied in industrial situations include:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Electrical Systems (faulty electrical connections or overloaded circuits) 
&lt;LI&gt;Mechanical Equipment (abnormally warm motors or possible bearing failures) 
&lt;LI&gt;Fluid Systems (line blockages, tank levels or pipe temperatures) 
&lt;LI&gt;Building Applications (detect missing insulation, air infiltration or moisture damage) 
&lt;LI&gt;Low-Slope Roofs (locate wet roof insulation) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While infrared imaging systems are relatively simple to use, interpreting images taken with this equipment can be far more complex and challenging. With training and experience, however, remarkable information can be extracted from an infrared camera that can help asset managers and maintenance personnel alike better maintain systems and equipment while monitoring or improving the quality of products.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When it comes to inspecting mechanical equipment with infrared, certain conditions are needed. It is also important for the thermographer to have a strong foundation of basic radiometry and heat transfer, knowledge of how the mechanical equipment operates, as well as a solid background on the infrared cameraâs capabilities and limitations. As with any type of technology, proper training is essential to successfully operate these systems. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_snell_01.jpg" width=217 height=198&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;Figure 1: The causes of an abnormally warm motor bearing are not always obvious but infrared is a key means of finding those which are running hot.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inspecting mechanical equipment with infrared thermography covers a wide variety of systems, everything from motors, rotating equipment, steam traps, refractory, and tank levels and more. Most of these inspections de-emphasize taking absolute temperature measurements and instead concentrate on comparing overall thermal patterns to understand the assetâs health. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Baseline inspections, where a thermographer captures an overall âthermal mapâ of a particular equipment type, is one of the more valuable uses of the technology, as subsequent inspections are then compared to the original âmapâ to detail any changes that may have occurred over time. The examples in this article represent only a few of the many areas where IR is utilized for inspecting mechanical equipment in an industrial facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While there are many ways to monitor the electrical and mechanical conditions of a motor, thermal imaging has proved itself to be useful mainly as a quick and efficient screening tool. We know that heat is created in any number of ways â by excessive friction, high electrical resistance, reduction of cooling air or fluids and problems with current flow in a motor. If an issue is detected, in the form of an abnormal thermal signature seen in the infrared image â an additional test method such as vibration analysis, airborne ultrasonics or motor circuit analysis â is typically requested to help pinpoint exactly what is causing an anomaly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_snell_02.jpg" width=240 height=208&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;Figure 2: Couplings often exhibit strong thermal signatures when there is misalignment or related problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Abnormal heating, such as what might occur in a misaligned coupling, could precede a detectable vibration signature. Left alone, such an issue compounds itself as it continues to get worse or even wear on the motor bearing itself. That in turn can also typically be detected with thermography. A variety of issues that are related to the motorâs electrical system may also have thermal patterns associated with them. An internal fault because of the breakdown of insulation on the motor windings can increase the overall temperature of the motor including the motor housing. Often, when the cooling air flow pathways become blocked in a motor, the winding insulation also fails.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_snell_03.jpg" width=204 height=206&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Infrared thermography is often used to locate suspected problems in bearings which can then be confirmed with other technologies.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inspecting bearings is another useful application for infrared thermography. Abnormal friction within a bearing, generating heat, causes the bearingâs surface temperature to rise. This thermal signature, when detected, is an indication of a potential bearing problem, anything from under-lubrication, over-lubrication, poor maintenance or simply a bad bearing. Infrared is especially helpful for inspecting low-speed equipment, including overhead conveyors or idlers, quickly and easily.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Thermography is also used to monitor temperatures on high-temperature refractory insulation such as a rotating kiln, furnace or boiler. Thermal patterns detected in these cases can be used to monitor the condition of the insulation or even calculate the thickness of the remaining refractory. This type of monitoring is invaluable as it facilitates planned maintenance outages and repair of a problem area vs. a catastrophic, and expensive, unplanned failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_snell_04.jpg" width=216 height=178&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 4: Thermography is a perfect tool for inspecting boiler refractory and air leakage issues. The location of failing refractory can be trended and, when alarm temperatures are determined, repairs can be scheduled.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the cost of energy increasing, steam traps are another application where infrared thermography can provide valuable savings for a facility. This is accomplished by detecting failures of traps that are stuck open. While airborne ultrasonics is considered a primary test method for this application, infrared inspections can be completed quickly and easily, even at some distance from the device. A trap that is functioning properly will typically have a large temperature difference between the steam and condensate sides. This temperature difference will temporarily disappear as it cycles. If both sides of the trap are warm it is an indication that the trap has failed open, a condition that can cost literally thousands of dollars in a year.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Both insulation and heat-tracing on process lines can also be inspected with infrared. Applications such as detecting line blockages, monitoring line temperatures, locating damaged or missing insulation can be accomplished with infrared with a few exceptions. Lines covered with very high levels of insulation are more problematic as are process lines that are wrapped with shiny aluminum or stainless steel sheet metal coverings. Inspecting in these situations can be very difficult due to the high thermal reflectivity/low emissivity of the surfaces encountered. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_snell_05.jpg" width=204 height=189&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;Figure 5: It is possible to locate levels in tanks and silos when they are in thermal transition, providing key information or confirming existing data.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, one of the easier mechanical applications of thermography is to locate levels of gases, liquids, fluidized solids and even sludge in tanks, vessels and silos. Although most storage tanks have a gauge to detect levels, these sensors often fail or must be independently confirmed due to the critical nature of a process.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Similar to inspecting line blockages, the different thermal capacities of solids, liquids, and gases and the way heat moves in and out of them mean these materials change temperature at different rates during a transient heat flow cycle. Gases, having the lowest thermal capacity of them all, typically change most quickly. Solids, with varying capacitances do not change as rapidly because slower, conductive, heat flow controls the temperature next to the tank wall. Floating materials, including waxes, can usually be distinguished from the liquid due to capacitance differences. Liquids typically take the longest to change because of their high thermal capacitance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In summary, mechanical infrared inspections can be challenging and rewarding both financially and professionally. The person performing the inspection must have an adequate working knowledge of the equipment they are inspecting as well as sufficient heat transfer theory training to interpret the thermal patterns they observe. As with any predictive maintenance technology, thermography is only one tool in the technicianâs toolbox. All the applicable predictive tools should be utilized to give the best possible picture of an assetâs health.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>ULIS quadruples production capacity of infrared detectors</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;ULIS, a high-volume manufacturer of infrared detectors for low-cost IR cameras in industrial, professional, and security applications, announced July 2 that the company has expanded the production capacity of its microbolometers from 50,000 to 200,000 units per year. ULIS is augmenting its production capacity to meet growing trends for lower cost IR detectors used by trade professionals for application in thermometry. The ramp-up enables ULIS to service orders of unprecedented magnitude.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ULIS sees three market drivers: the emerging trend to add infrared capability to visible surveillance cameras (about 25 million are currently installed worldwide); government mandates for improved safety; and new regulations in energy conservation and building compliance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"This upgrade is a first step in a capacity extension plan that will address the market for large-scale orders, 100K-plus," says Jean-FranÃ§ois Delepau, managing director of ULIS. "Customers can be assured of a ready and available supply that hits mass market target price points enabling them to be aggressively more competitive in the market."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;According to ULIS, trade professionals are increasingly using thermal imagers to inspect building equipment. For example, with the help of an IR camera, plumbers can check the water temperature of pipes embedded in under floor heating and allow them to adjust the distribution of the heat. There are roughly 240,000 plumbing enterprises in Europe. "With a camera price below EUR 2,000, these enterprises could benefit from the advantages IR detectors can bring," added Delepau.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The ramp-up is also an outcome of the double-digit compound growth ULIS has been experiencing every year since its founding in 2002, when it was spun-off from CEA-Leti, a leading European micro- and nanotechnologies R&amp;amp;D center and Sofradir, a leader in cooled IR detectors. GE Equity replaced CEA-Leti as minority shareholder in 2008.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Included in ULIS' extension plan are new buildings to accommodate staff growth (a 25 percent increase last year), a new training center for customers to test-run microbolometer products, and a production ramp-up of its new high-definition 17-micron IR detector, which it introduced to the market earlier this year. The new buildings will enable a future production capacity of up to 500,000 units per year.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;ULIS is ranked third in the world for uncooled IR detectors, after DRS Technologies and FLIR (source: "The World Market for Commercial and Dual-Use Infrared Imaging and Infrared Thermometry Equipment Report", Maxtech International Inc. 2008). ULIS was among one of the first companies to deploy its IR detectors in cameras used to conduct health checks at airports and other public places, initially for SARS and more recently to detect swine flu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;U&gt;About ULIS&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ULIS manufactures high-volume infrared detectors for low-cost, low power, lightweight IR cameras. It offers a range of small and large form factor IR products for industrial, professional, and security applications. ULIS' IR detectors are key components of IR equipment increasingly used in energy audits in buildings, thermography, security &amp;amp; surveillance, and night vision driving for motor vehicles, as well as fire-fighting and lightweight military equipment. ULIS is the leader of uncooled infrared detectors based on an amorphous silicon technology called microbolometers, an easy and reliable semiconductor material to manufacture. Customers recognize ULIS' IR detectors for their low weight, low power consumption and availability in large volumes. Compared with any other thermal imaging supplier, ULIS offers unique advantages in enabling OEMs, worldwide, to custom-design IR systems, allowing them to achieve true differentiation with their IR camera products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/Rfz6-CbH7po" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Service recovers lost, stolen or missing infrared cameras</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;FLIR Systems Inc on June 17 announced the introduction of ThermaTrak, an exclusive high-tech service to locate missing or stolen infrared cameras and thermal imagers. ThermaTrak from FLIR, developed with GadgetTrak, employs recovery software that pinpoints the geographic location of the lost, stolen or missing infrared camera. Additionally, the ThermaTrak software embedded in the camera tracks the IP address, hostname and even the Internet service provider (ISP) being used after the IR camera has gone missing or been stolen and is connected to the Internet.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;âThis is the first-ever theft tracking system for IR cameras. We are very excited to announce our exclusive agreement with GadgetTrak to offer this new recovery technology customized to FLIR IR cameras,â said Tom Scanlon, vice president for FLIR. âThe affordability and protection is exactly what our end-users want.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;ThermaTrak is also used for asset management when multiple cameras are deployed in the field. With tracking activated, each time a camera is connected to a computer with internet access, an email is sent with a link to an updated location report.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;âThermaTrak has several unique abilities that you will not find elsewhereâ, said Ken Westin, founder and CEO of GadgetTrak, commenting on the partnership with FLIR. âThermaTrak software leverages our patented theft recovery system for use with IR cameras and discretely contacts the owner in the event it is lost or stolen. Data is delivered to ThermaTrak and a report is generated with the time, username, computer name, internal network address, location, and other data that relates to the deviceâs connection. All images, location and network data are sent to the device owner.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;In the case of theft, law enforcement agencies are able to find out the suspectâs name, address and phone number through ISP information. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;ThermaTrak requires an upgrade to the IR camera and is available with a standalone subscription or through FLIRâs extended warranty. FLIR IR cameras run from under $3,000 to $400,000 per unit, so the security and peace of mind now offered by ThermaTrak is a big plus.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/fR591LsyuFA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The benefits of integrating lean concepts with infrared thermography</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Lean thinking is nothing new, nor many of its concepts, but the real value is in how these concepts are integrated into a total solution. Many companies today are either lean companies, or are utilizing lean thinking to maintain a competitive advantage in the market (for example: Dell, Southwest Airlines, FedEx). With the ever-changing demands that are placed on company resources, rapid changes in personnel because of downsizing and the demand to âdo more with lessâ while increasing productivity and value, many companies have been applying lean thinking to the management of their maintenance programs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Companies like Ford, General Motors, Boeing, WE Energies, Entergy, Hawaiian/Maui Electric, Florida Power and Light, and KEPRI have all established lean infrared programs and are able to better manage and maintain the real value of their IR programs while drastically increasing their return on investment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Batch &amp;amp; Queue vs. Progressive Production&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Prior to the advent of the assembly line, activities were done in batches, or in batch-and-queue mode, where specific tasks are grouped together before going to another queue and waiting for the next phase of work to be completed. This type of batch-and-queue thinking is not uncommon, but it has some real disadvantages when it comes to speed of production and quality control. Because of these shortcomings, Henry Ford focused on the actual flow of the activities associated with the assembly of cars. He called this flow âprogressive productionâ, which led him to establishing what is known today as the modern assembly line.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By switching from a batch-and-queue mode to a progressive production mode, Henry Ford was able to reduce the time it would take to assemble a car by 50 percent. He actually had someone physically pulling the carâs chassis through the assembly process. Next, by using a motorized conveyor system which provided for a continuous speed or flow, Henry had reduced what had taken 728 hours in a batch and queue mode to only 90 minutes, with an increase in production of 485 percent thereby reducing the cost of goods sold, while increasing production and obtaining a higher quality product!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It has been said that, âThe assembly line is the most significant technological development of the 21st centuryâ. Today, assembly lines make everything from the Apple iPod nano to the Boeing 777. We can clearly see that progressive production has many benefits. By switching from a batch-and-queue mode to a progressive production approach, products and services can be performed faster, with less effort, and with higher quality. The key to your success, though, is in how you apply these methods.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Birth of âLean Thinkingâ&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;While large-scale assembly line production was working well for the American automotive industry, Taiichi Ohno (1919-1990), a Toyota Motor Company executive, found that many of the principles would only work when you had large-scale assembly lines and ample resources in material and labor. Toyota had a problem with trying to implement these practices on a much smaller scale, which was more in line with the companyâs manufacturing needs. Toyota needed to come up with a way to apply the benefits of the assembly line with its manufacturing restrictions if the auto maker was going to be competitive. Toyota simply could not produce the same volume at the same amount of waste. It had to find ways to do more with less.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ohno had to develop practices that would identify any waste in the process. But to define what waste is in any system, you must first establish what is of value, and look at the value stream to see what activities add value as opposed to those activities that do not contribute value or actually diminish that value. Anything that does not directly add value to the process is waste, and must be removed from the system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Identifying and Removing Waste&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;For Ohno, it was a matter of reappraising what was of value in the flow of their assembly line activities, eliminating any wasted steps or actions, and âright-sizingâ the assembly lines to match changing production demands. Toyota had to become lean.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean thinking is simply the discipline of doing more with less and less â¦ as in less wasted effort, wasted time and wasted materials! Ohno identified seven types of wasted human effort, time and materials.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Seven Wastes (Manufacturing / Assembly Production)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Overproduction ahead of demand. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Waiting for the next processing step. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unnecessary transport of materials. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Over processing of parts due to poor tool and product design. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inventories more than the absolute minimum. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unnecessary movement by employees during the course of their work (looking for parts, tools, prints, help, etc.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Production of defective parts. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota was able to very effectively develop and apply the lean concepts to its assembly line processes, as well as every other aspect within their company â from the way it handled paperwork, to the way it supported its car dealerships. The company then took the success of its lean thinking concepts and worked together with suppliers to apply the same principles within its business and build a lean enterprise that would work together to find waste in the entire system, and eliminate it. Today, lean principles have been integrated into all types of business models, from lean manufacturing, lean services, lean software development, even lean government departments and a lean navy. (Google results: lean thinking = 495,000; lean enterprise = 426,000; lean business = 61,400; and lean maintenance = 16,000.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lean Thinking and Lean Infrared&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;There are many similarities that can be made between the automotive assembly process and the infrared predictive maintenance practices that are helpful in getting a better understanding of lean thinking principles.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When you look at the advantages of going from a batch-and-queue model to a progressive production model, and then apply lean thinking to help correctly establish best practices for your own specific situations and applying it to infrared, you end up with a lean infrared program, or lean IR.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the automotive industry, the focus is on the production activities of assembling car parts into a complete car. In an infrared predictive maintenance program, the focus must be on the activities of collecting/retrieving the data, which goes into the IR program. Whether it is car parts or data, if it is not of high quality and assembled in the right way, then what you get is âgarbage in equals garbage outâ, no matter how you build it. For a lean IR program, the focus must be on quality data, delivered in the right sequence, while eliminating any wasted effort. Anything that can degrade or impede the quality of the data must be avoided.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Seven Areas of Waste in Conducting a Traditional IR Inspection:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not having a clear, defined route of what is to be tested. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inefficient methods of inspection data collection and reconciliation in the field. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Redundant data entry once in the field and then back at the computer &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data entry errors, incorrectly identifying equipment that has a problem, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Having to correct data entry errors. Having to go back into the field to get the correct information on a piece of equipment or a problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not having a good method of establishing what IR and visual images go with which problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Being locked into a specific IR camera manufacturerâs software because their proprietary IR image files will not work with other programs. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Traditional Batch-and-Queue Model for Infrared Thermography&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;For example: A typical thermographer can expect for an eight-hour day of scanning that 75 percent of his or her time is spent looking through the camera, trying to find problems (sort of like a search and rescue mode), while the other 25 percent of the time is spent writing up problems in the field when they are found. Of the first 75 percent of time that the thermographer is trying to stay on task, locate what equipment is to be inspected, and keep some type of a list or inventory as to what had been vs. what had not been tested.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note: If the thermographer is really doing his or her job the right way, that person should also be reconciling all of the past problems (both open and closed) from all previous inspections. Make sure to close out any open problems that have been fixed correctly and check to make sure that any past closed problems are not starting to reappear. This requires taking all of the past reports out into the field and examining each one to see if there was ever a problem on each and every piece of equipment. It should be noted that this is not easy or practical to do given the restrictions in the way data is handled in a typical IR program, because it would require lugging all of the past reports out into the field.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When the thermographer does find a problem, he or she typically stores the thermogram to a flash card in the IR camera, writes findings down with pencil and paper, and snaps a visual image. (They may also save a voice annotation comment into the IR image or use a recorder).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the completion of the inspection, the thermographer now has stored in a queue a batch of IR and visual images, as well as notes (either on paper or voice memos) which will be used for compiling into a report. At some later time, the thermographer will have to sit down and take the stack of paper notes, thermograms and visual images, and enter them into a computer typically producing a Microsoft Word document or other type of flat file.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is not uncommon if you are going to produce a quality report for an eight-hour inspection to easily require from two to four hours of report generation time after the inspection is done (if not more). In most cases, the ability to actually sit down immediately after the completion of the inspection, or even the next day, is not possible, and the report generation phase may actually take place a few days to weeks after the actual inspection. (Note: It is also not uncommon for many IR consulting companies to take as much as two to six weeks to get the report back to their customers after the inspection.)&lt;BR&gt;We can see that the traditional batch-and-queue model that is used for report generation:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does not allow for any information in the field to be used (no flow or pull)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Allows for countless errors to be introduced into the data&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is very time consuming &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does not add any value to the program&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is limiting; because all of the actual data is in the form of a report or flat file, there is no way for the data to flow or to be used in other ways or by other programs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We need to define specific terms as they apply to lean thinking and lean IR.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Error-Proofing&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Error-proofing your data is a very important tool that is used to eliminate the waste of having to redo a task. It involves looking closely at the tasks and anticipating all of the ways that errors can be introduced. Since having to correct data errors will stop the flow of the process, if not reverse it, and create a tremendous amount of wasted effort and time, it is very important to carefully consider any and all areas that errors can be made.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the automotive industry, it may involve using steel that is galvanized on all sides so that it cannot be placed into the stamping press upside down. In conducting an infrared inspection, it may involve utilizing bar codes so that equipment and their associated problems are not incorrectly documented on an adjacent piece of equipment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Typical errors made writing up an inspection:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not correctly identifying the right piece of equipment that is to be tested&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not knowing if there was a past problem on the equipment that needs to be reconciled against the previous findings&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not correctly associating the correct IR or visual image with the problem&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data entry mistakes based on poor handwriting of field notes&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data entry errors / typos while entering data into the computer&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not recording all of the data and trying to commit it to memory, thinking that you can remember all of the correct information&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Having someone who was not actually present at the time of the inspection type up the report/findings&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Too much time has lapsed between collecting the data and generating the report (the data is out of date)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each of the above errors and many more are very common in the typical practice of conducting infrared inspections. If they are not adequately addressed, they will create a tremendous amount of wasted effort, time, resources and money.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Flow&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In the automotive industry, flow defines the flow of parts arriving just in time with the assembly process. In lean infrared, flow applies to the flow of information (like parts) to and from the thermographer, just in time, in the field with the activities of the inspection.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The rhythm of the flow must ensure that the right amount of information in the right sequence is delivered to the thermographer for him or her to be able to do work without any wasted effort. This rhythm must be flexible enough to allow the thermographer the ability to work in a variety of ways that best fits the circumstances in the field. The flow and rhythm of the information delivery system can be broken down into specific tasks that the thermographer performs while conducting an inspection.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inspection tasks:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Locating the equipment that is to be inspected&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Identifying if there have been any problems that need to be reconciled &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Scanning the equipment to be inspected &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reconciling past problem conditions (closing out of past open problems) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Documenting problems, either new or re-documenting any chronic conditions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Flow Delivery System&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;When focus is placed on the value of having the correct data delivered to the thermographer in the field, just like a conveyor system delivering parts to the assembly line, then we must consider options for data storage and retrieval like a mobile database solution. We must also consider a mobile hardware solution that will provide a platform for data to automatically be collected in the field. The synergy of the two and the rhythm of the data flow are key to what is called field force automation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We see FedEx and UPS using portable data collection equipment that scans bar codes and tracks packages all the way up to where we actually sign our name on them. Police and emergency medical technicians, utility company meter readers, even stores like Home Depot use portable data collectors to track inventory.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Pull&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In relation to the automotive industry, pull happens through an event (for example: the man that was pulling Henry Fordâs car chassis through the assemble line). His activities pulled the required materials that are needed to fulfill the order through the system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In thermography, the pull event happens when the thermographer is requesting information from the mobile database that will allow the inspection to be performed. For example, by scanning a bar code on a piece of equipment, a mobile database can pull up the equipmentâs entire history and provide it to the thermographer so it can be reconciled to see if there are any past problems on it. By studying the specific activities that are required by the thermographer in the field, and setting in place a mobile delivery system for the flow of the specific information that is in rhythm with what data is required, you can easily put in place a system that automatically delivers the information when the thermographer needs it (just like a perfect dance partner). The key is in matching the rhythm of the flow to the rhythm of the pull. When this is done, you make the thermographerâs job much easier because he or she has all of the information at hand when and where it is needed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The thermographer will need to âpull upâ information in regards to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Being able to locate what equipment is to be tested based on a geographical hierarchical route list so that equipment can be tested in a sequence that affords the most economical utilization of effort&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Knowing what the test status is on the equipment that is to be tested or has been tested&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Knowing what the problem status is on the equipment that is to be tested&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reconciling past open problems to see if corrective repair actions have been made correctly&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reconciling past closed problems to double-check that the repair actions have been made correctly and that the problems are not coming back&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Flat Files vs. a Mobile Database Solution&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Relational databases offer an extremely useful method of data collection and retrieval as compared to having the data reside in a report. By using a relational database, data entry can be dramatically reduced because you do not have any redundant data. Once it is entered into the database, the data can be used over and over again without having to retype it. Reports can be run against the database to provide a hard copy printout in the same way that your bank sends you a bank statement at the end of each month.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By using a mobile database solution that can deliver the right information, just in time, that is in rhythm with the thermographerâs activities, you can significantly increase the quality of the data and eliminate redundant data entry when compared to the typical batch-and-queue method of report generation. One by-product of using a mobile database solution is the benefit of a âprogressive report production systemâ that allows immediate information distribution and report generation without having to come back to your desk and type up your report, because the report is being done literally in the field while you are collecting data.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The user interface of the mobile database program can be customized using many visual controls to present information graphically (for example, an Explorer Route view of equipment and locations similar to the File Explorer in Windows). The software can automatically provide âprogressive filteringâ of the information so that what you are looking for is readably available.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Visual Controls&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Visual controls are tools that allow for immediate access to information (like pressure gages on a control panel) that provide ways to easily identify what the conditions are at the moment. When visual controls are integrated within the user interface of the database software, you can easily convey a lot of data quickly without having to go through extra effort to look up the information. They play a very important part in the flow and pull of information to the thermographer. Simple visual signals like using stoplights to display the problem status of equipment (such as red to indicate a problem exists, yellow for a past problem and green for not having a problem) dramatically show how a symbol used as a visual control can quickly and easily convey a lot of data to the thermographer.&lt;BR&gt;The user interface can take advantages of many methods of allowing the thermographer to easily pull up the information. Visual controls can be used to convey information to the thermographer, such as routes, test status, problem status, repair status, as well as providing all of the past IR and visual images from all of the past inspections. And by using bar codes, you can error-proof the data entry and automate the retrieval of equipment history, thereby providing the thermographer with the ability to reconcile information effortlessly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Field Force Automation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In this case, right-sizing the data delivery system for both the hardware and software is very important if you are going to take advantage of field force automation and data collection.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Matching not only the needs in the field but of the overall IR program is very important. Anticipating the ever-changing demand that will be placed on how the data will be used in the future is critical. Donât paint yourself into a corner. There are a large number of mobile hardware options that can accommodate the growth of your IR program. The Pocket PC today, for example, is very powerful and comes in just about every conceivable configuration, from combat-hardened devices to systems with built-in phones, cameras, GPS and bar code scanners.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Right Sizing&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Since we can draw on the comparison of a batch-and-queue model vs. a progressive production mode, and the analogy of part vs. data, we need to look for the right-size/method of data retrieval and data input â that is, a method that takes advantage of error-proofing and allows for a seamless flow of data as the thermographerâs activities pull it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key to success is in making sure that the specific solution is the right size for the thermographer to be able to use. This means that the hardware and software solution will actually meet his or her needs in the field. One of the biggest mistakes is in trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (or a better analogy is 10 pounds of chocolate into a five-pound box.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The case in point is that trying to make a CMMS program like MAXIMO or SAP into what the thermographer needs to be using in the field for data collection will be a complete failure in the field because it is completely out of touch with what the tasks are for the delivery of information while he or she is doing an inspection. Itâs like delivering the wrong parts at the wrong time and in the wrong quantity in the assembly line process. The way to work through this is to utilize a database that will allow for the exchange of data in a variety of ways that allows for migration of information from one database to another.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lean Infrared and Progressive Report Production&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;One of the best benefits of establishing a lean Infrared program is that you now have in place a method of progressive report production for the process of data collection and retrieval. That will allow for the progressive flow of information to and from the field as the inspections are being performed. This lets the thermographer actually pull up the information when and where he or she need it without any wasted effort. This progressive report production system also includes methods of error-proofing to ensure that the quality of data is also being collected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Progressive report production by using a mobile database solution also eliminates the necessity of having to sit down at a computer and type up a report since all of the data is entered into the database during the actual inspection. By synchronizing the mobile database with a desktop computer or server, all of the data that is gathered in the field is automatically uploaded to the computer for immediate access as well as printing out reports. So what may have taken days to enter and then distribute is now done instantly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The advantages of combining lean thinking concepts, progressive report production, mobile database solutions into a lean infrared program for the automation of data collection and the ability to share the results in real time would even make Henry Ford proud.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The benefits of a lean IR program:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Focus is on methods to improve the quality of data&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Utilization of error-proofing to ensure quality data&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Automation of the flow of data to the thermographer that is in rhythm with when and where he or she needs it&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reduce effort by the thermographer to have to find information&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Better informed thermographers about equipment history&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No report generation time is required because of a progressive reporting process&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Faster response time because information is immediately available when problems are found&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All problems are able to be trended over time and adequately followed up&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

            <title>Sofradir to acquire infrared equipment firm Electrophysics</title>
            <description>Sofradir, a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced infrared (IR) detectors for military, space and industrial applications announced today that it will acquire Electrophysics, a U.S. developer of advanced high-performance IR equipment. Sofradir expects to complete the transaction within 30 days. The value of the transaction was not disclosed. 
&lt;P&gt;The acquisition is expected to accelerate the development of Sofradir and its subsidiary ULIS in the North American market. It will provide Sofradir and ULIS with a US platform to better serve the North American IR detector and module market, estimated at US$1 billion (approximately Eur 700 million), the largest in the world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa0&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;This strategic foothold will boost Sofradir and ULIS&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa1&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s growth by bringing us closer to customers in the US who will have ready access to our advanced cooled and uncooled IR technologies, known for their performance, reliability and producibility&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa2&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; said Philippe Bensussan, chairman and CEO of Sofradir and chairman of ULIS. &lt;SPAN id=bwanpa3&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;Having a US base of operations will allow us to be more cost competitive and responsive to our customers.&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa4&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Electrophysics&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa5&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; president Frank Vallese, who will continue to head the US operation said: &lt;SPAN id=bwanpa6&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;We are delighted with this opportunity. It will be a big plus to have Sofradir&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa7&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s talent, technology and expertise here on North American soil. Sofradir has an exciting product development roadmap and an established history of delivering high-quality IR detectors. We foresee a wide range of market opportunities in public safety, security and defense, supplying both OEM&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa8&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s and system integrators&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa9&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sofradir is a leading provider of IR detectors. Together with ULIS, the company shipped 40,000 IR detectors, worldwide, this year. The purchase of Electrophysics, founded in 1969, will help it ramp up sales and enhance the service it provides to US customers in the defense, space and commercial industries. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa10&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;By joining the experienced team of 35 at Electrophysics, Sofradir is taking an important step forward to the benefit of the customers of both companies,&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa11&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt; added Bensussan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;About Sofradir&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Sofradir develops and manufactures advanced infrared detectors (IR) for military, space and commercial applications. It specializes in cooled IR detectors based on a sophisticated high performance technology, Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT), and its vast product portfolio of scanning and staring arrays covers the entire infrared spectrum. Sofradir also offers QWIP detectors developed in cooperation with Thales. Ulis, a subsidiary of Sofradir, designs and manufactures low cost uncooled amorphous silicon infrared detectors for commercial applications.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sofradir and Ulis directly export more than 70 percent of their products. Customers include the US Army, Thales, Sagem, Selex, Thales Alenia Space, ESA (European Space Agency) and FLIR Systems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sofradir&lt;SPAN id=bwanpa12&gt;â&lt;/SPAN&gt;s headquarters is located in Chatenay-Malabry, near Paris, France. Its manufacturing facilities and those of ULIS are located in Veurey-Voroize, near Grenoble. Sofradir and Ulis employ 470 people. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;About Electrophysics&lt;/B&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;Founded in 1969, Electrophysics designs and manufactures infrared equipment for a wide range of imaging applications including portable thermal imagers as well as night vision modules for low-light photography and videography.

            <title>Thermography saves Eaton Group $250,000 per year</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Thermography, among other things, reve&amp;shy;als and measures heat generation in machines and installations. It visualizes overheated components, and detects and prevents âcreepingâ breakdowns. It has become a familiar and accepted techni&amp;shy;que for preventive maintenance. What is less well known, however, is that the con&amp;shy;sistent, large-scale use of thermography can yield impressive savings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The American Eaton Group produces a very wide range of industrial goods worldwide, and has a turnover of $9.8 billion. In Europe, its segments Eaton Fluid Power, Eaton Automotive and Eaton Truck are strongly represented. They focus on various systems and com&amp;shy;ponents for vehicles and for the aviation sector: from hydraulic systems for the new Airbus A380 to compressors for the engines of legendary Italian motorcycle maker Ducati. Eaton Electrical manufac&amp;shy;tures and modifies low- and medium-voltage distributors and installations for industrial customers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consistent inspection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eaton Electricalâs Field Service Department operates from the Netherlands. An auto&amp;shy;nomous profit center, which also has exter&amp;shy;nal customers, the department inspects all of the Eaton Groupâs European sites. This means that all the electrical installations at all 26 production sites from Poland to Portugal receive a thorough annual inspection with the thermal ima&amp;shy;ging camera. Naturally, a careful look-out is kept for hot spots and other develop&amp;shy;ments in cables and switches during these tours of inspection. But how is this infor&amp;shy;mation gathered and processed? How is the thermographic information classified, assessed and presented?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Peter Koelewijn is the field service supervisor and chief thermographer at Eaton. In this function, he visits all of the Eaton Groupâs sites every year. With his FLIR Systems ThermaCAM P65 thermal imaging came&amp;shy;ra at the ready, he inspects all low- and medium-voltage installations at the sites. Koelewijn has a couple of rules of thumb which help ensure that the inspec&amp;shy;tions go smoothly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI set the emission value carefully,â he says. âI donât make much use of the auto focus because I can adjust the settings faster manually; but, I do attach importance to a precise setting for the range. I make important comments directly into the headset.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The images and data stored locally in the camera are then loaded into the compu&amp;shy;ter and, using the FLIR Systems Reporter software, introduced into a report and subjected to further analysis. It goes wit&amp;shy;hout saying that interpreting the infrared images requires a thorough knowledge of the inspected installations. And although the results of these inspections are, in fact, only recommendations, it is advisable for local maintenance managers to follow the advice given by the thermographer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âYou can only draw conclusions on the basis of experience and a thorough understanding of both the camera and the installations you inspectâ says Koelewijn. âOf course, itâs also important to have the reports of the previous years within reach.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Classification and savings&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At Eaton, the inspection results are clas&amp;shy;sified according to a four-level fault rating system: a âminor problemâ can be sorted out during the regular maintenance rounds by one of the groupâs 50 preventive maintenance employees. At the opposite end of the scale are âcritical problemsâ, which require immediate intervention and also involve an additional thermographic inspection on-site straight after the repair work. The levels in between â âserious pro&amp;shy;blemâ and âintermediate problemâ â requi&amp;shy;re repairs within one to two days and two weeks of the inspection, respectively. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The report â consisting of a visual and an infrared photo of the scanned object, a temperature curve, basic thermographic data and a commentary â is then sent to the local maintenance managers and archived at the service department at Eaton Electrical for subsequent use. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This precise classification into levels of urgency, detailed reporting per scanned object and regular inspecting saves the Eaton Group some $250,000 a year in Europe alone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A customer-friendly camera&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, is the man with the all-seeing thermal imaging camera actually welcome at Eaton sites? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âYes, absolutely,â laughs Koelewijn. âThe visual aspect of the inspection, which this camera provides in both its daylight and infrared modes, represents significant added value. Another positive feature is that, thanks to the large detachable LCD screen on the ThermaCAM P65, the local manager can follow the measurements. A user-friendly, versatile camera is fine, but a customer-friendly camera is obviously an additional benefit. And if we point it upward for a moment, we can even tell the maintenan&amp;shy;ce people which of the fluorescent lamps on their premises need replacing.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Infrared part of effective PM strategy at Weyerhaeuser</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;If you can use a digital camera, you can learn to operate the Fluke Ti30 thermal imager. While the images from the Ti30 may not make it into the family photo album, they could very well save your business thousands of dollars when integrated into your overall preventive maintenance strategy. Just ask Dave Feniak at the Drayton Valley, Alberta, location of Weyerhaeuser Company, one of the worldâs largest integrated forest products companies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Feniak, the sawmillâs electrical maintenance supervisor, purchased the imager and, after some basic training on its use, went into the plant and found a problem â a big problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have been doing IR (infrared) scans routinely on a six- to nine-month basis since 1992 or so, and we usually find very few problems. I was looking at bearings in the planer mill and noticed a very hot spot in the far distance,â Feniak said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Ti30 has a built-in laser pointer, and once Feniak turned it on he found that heat was being generated about 150 feet away from the sawmill trim-saw motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âTaking the camera right over to the motor, we saw the motor windings were at 90 degrees Celsius (194 Fahrenheit),â he said. âWe did amp checks and found a severe imbalance between phases. This was on a Thursday, so we got our spare motor out and installed it the next morning on the maintenance shift, with no downtime. If the motor had failed on shift, the cost would have been approximately $30,000 for the downtime, plus the repairs would have been more expensive.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Weyerhaeuserâs $14,000 investment quickly paid for itself. And, it has certainly helped to legitimize the concept of preventive maintenance at the sawmill. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOur electrical department is just starting to build a predictive maintenance program,â said Feniak. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The company uses an outside contractor for infrared scans on a routine basis. Between IR scans, Weyerhaeuser uses a single-spot temperature gun, but diagnosis of problems is limited, Feniak said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âUsing the Ti30, we can quickly and easily see details of the problems,â said Feniak. âOur sawmill is constantly pushed to be faster and we target increased reliability. Using this tool has already shown us problems in early stages, allowing us to add oil to a gear reducer or replace a fan on a motor before the problem got worse.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These measures give Weyerhaeuser the time it needs to plan, schedule and make repairs before equipment fails, avoiding major breakdowns and costly downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Studies show that a planned repair job typically takes only half as much time as an unplanned job. In his book âPlant Engineerâs Handbookâ, Keith Mobley links the following benefits to preventive maintenance: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Maintenance costs â down by 50 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Unexpected failures â reduced by 55 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Repair and overhaul time â down by 60 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Spare parts inventory â reduced by 30 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ 30 percent increase in machinery mean time between failures (MTBF) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ 30 percent increase in uptime &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And for the typical manufacturing plant, a 10 percent reduction in maintenance costs has the same bottom-line impact as a 40 percent increase in sales. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The technology behind the Fluke Ti30 thermal imager is infrared thermography, which detects the infrared electromagnetic energy emitted by an object and converts it into a signal that produces a color image on the camera screen for immediate viewing. The image also can be stored for further detailed analysis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Fluke Electronics Canada sales representative Ken Reeves, the unitâs software helps users take area measurements and then print a report with images and annotations to use as supporting documentation. That can be particularly useful in dealing with insurance underwriters, Reeves adds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIt helps to have the thermography study in your preventive maintenance report so the insurance underwriter has proof that a problem was fixed and that the plant will stay up and running. If your report shows you made the necessary repairs, the insurance company will have no problem covering downtime expenses,â Reeves said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reeves encourages purchasers to take advantage of the two-day training that comes with the unit. Training covers technical nuances such as conduction and thermal dynamics. Designated technicians completing the training can then show others at the plant how to become effective with the device. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOne mill employee took the training at Snell IR, primarily to become familiar with image analysis,â said Feniak. âBecause the imager itself is quite simple to use, we are training ourselves in-house on how to operate the tool and capture images.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As Feniakâs experience shows, adding thermography to a preventive maintenance program can significantly improve both the reliability and efficiency of plant systems. Feniak suggests a good way to investigate the usefulness of a thermal imager is to ask a Fluke representative for a demonstration and spend 20 minutes with it out in your facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSince 1992, we have had a reputable contractor scan our site every nine months, and our faults continue to decrease each year,â said Feniak. âEven so, we found several interesting warm spots using the Ti30 that we were able to correct before they became a problem. The opportunity for us is that we can scan every item in our plant more frequently, not just the critical points on our contractorâs list every nine months. We can also do in-house PM (preventive maintenance) on more equipment than we currently do with a contractor.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Persistence leads to hot-spot solution</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;Th&lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;e Reliability in Action department features case studies submitted by our readers. To have your case study considered for inclusion in an upcoming issue, e-mail it to &lt;A href="mailto:parnold@noria.com"&gt;parnold@noria.com&lt;/A&gt; or mail it to Reliable Plant, P.O. Box 87, Fort Atkinson, WI 53538. If we publish your case study, we'll send you an official Reliable Plant T-shirt. This issue's case study was written by a predictive maintenance specialist at an electric company in the western United States:&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In November 2005, a routine infrared survey located hot spots on isophase bus tube ducts. Initial thoughts led our team to believe that the heat was generated from corrosion-laden bolts. Therefore, recommendations to repair the hot spot dealt strictly with these bolts and the close surroundings. However, when initial recommendations failed to resolve the problem, the phenomenon and solution was in question. How could corrosion cause hot spots in these bolts and no hot spots in the many other bolts in the same area? A recent outage would reveal the root cause. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Action-Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Action-Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hot spot 1 is displayed in photograph and infrared form. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Area, location and description:&lt;/B&gt; The troubled area bolts were located on the isophase bus ducts connecting the 180-megawatt generator to the 13.8-kilovolt main transformer, and also near the auxiliary transformer. The bolts connected bonding jumpers between ducts. A total of five troubled areas were found. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Findings:&lt;/B&gt; Upon routine infrared rounds, the following shots were observed (see photos on this and subsequent page). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Initial recommendations:&lt;/B&gt; We were consulted that this event was a "common anomaly in many isophase systems." Apparently, induction causes heating in iron bolts, washers or both. Also, circulating currents through grounded isophase bus duct and support beam systems can cause heating. The grounding strap normally carries the most heat and could continue heating to the melting point. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hot spot 2 is displayed in photograph and infrared form. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The recommendation was, first of all, to change the bolt and washer to stainless non-ferrous hardware. The second option was to clean all grounding straps on the ducts. The idea was that these grounding straps were taking all of the current and the other "cold" straps were not. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This work was completed and a post-work infrared survey done. The survey found that the situation was unresolved. While the heating of the isophase bus was a common issue in industry, we were experiencing something quite different. The answer would be found when investigating recent work done on the ducts and transformers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure5.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Action-Figure5.jpg"&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure6.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Reli_Action-Figure6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hot spot 3 is displayed in photograph and infrared form. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Recent outage/action:&lt;/B&gt; As the history on this equipment was researched, we discovered that personnel working on the transformer had cut the shorting plate (see below) at the main transformer in order to replace the center bushing during the overhaul. Cutting the shorting plate changed the dynamics of the induced currents in the three phases and allowed circulating currents to build up. This caused the high temperatures in the grounding straps' bolts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Post-repair condition:&lt;/B&gt; Post-temporary repair conditions were acceptable, and plans for permanent repairs were made. After the final repairs, heating in all areas was once again normal.

            <title>How good is your infrared program?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the past three columns, my colleague John Schultz has asked you, "How mature is your PdM program?" He explained the five levels of predictive maintenance maturity, from Level 1 (not engaged) all the way through Level 5 (best practices). Carrying forward through the next several issues, I will follow that train of thought, but at the individual technology level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let's discuss your infrared (IR) thermography program. Do you have a skeleton program that allows you to check a box on your goals and objectives sheet? If so, you most likely aren't seeing any significant results in terms of identifying the presence of electrical and mechanical (yes, I said mechanical) failure modes. On the other hand, do you have a professional, formal, engineered thermal inspection program that pays dividends on the electrical, mechanical and stationary equipment in your facility? Let's take a look and see which one you actually have. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some Level 1 programs have an IR program on their high-voltage (greater than 600 volts) switchgear. This normally comes in the form of an annual inspection conducted through an insurance carrier. Most of the time, these programs center around preventing fires in the plant and detecting faults on the large, expensive transformers and switchgear that feed the entire plant. A Level 5 program is inclusive of all electrical components in the facility. Additionally, the Level 5 program has standards that allow for no thermal anomalies. Level 1 programs, on the other hand, only report problems that show drastic temperature differences (e.g. 25 degrees Fahrenheit between phases). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The mechanical and stationary side of the house is where most IR programs fall woefully short of the mark. This always confused me because a comprehensive mechanical inspection program can pay immediate and drastic returns. Another point of confusion is that your failure modes analysis should have alerted you to the possibility of problems that are most easily (and sometimes only) detectable via thermal analysis. However, people still don't have any type of mechanical inspection tasks inside their IR program. Failure modes like V-belts too tight, seals improperly installed and refractory degradation are all problems that are easily detected with infrared thermography, but not enough people use the technology to find these types of faults. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful tools in a reliability effort is a well-trained operator and spot radiometer. Level 5 programs have operators who are task qualified in the proper use of spot radiometers and have a set of points on their machine(s) that they measure several times per shift. They are a powerful defense against impending failures. When an operator is used to seeing 114 degrees F on a given point (a coupling, for instance) and then today measures it at 132 degrees F, a notable change has occurred. Immediately, the operator (if there is a standard workflow procedure in place) knows to call the PdM technician and request a special, more detailed analysis of the situation. Is it a misalignment? Or, is it a dry coupling in need of lubrication? This is hard for the operator to know with such a simple measurement, but it will be easy for the PdM team to figure out. A Level 1 program has no such inspection procedure in place and, therefore, can't enjoy the benefits of this additional level of defense. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another extremely powerful tool in the reliability effort is to have both electrical and mechanical crafts personnel task-qualified in the proper use of spot radiometers. Electricians can use spot radiometers to troubleshoot electrical apparatus and for post-repair verification. For example, if the PdM thermographer previously had identified a thermal anomaly (i.e. "hot spot") and the electrician made the repair, the electrician could then double-check his work with the spot radiometer and know beyond a doubt that the defect was eliminated. Also, given this new level of knowledge and the new tool, on regular jobs such as replacing breakers and starters, the electrician could use the spot radiometer to double-check all of the connections to make sure none had received an improper amount of torque. Mechanical crafts personnel can use the same tool for similar functions. Thermography is excellent for double-checking seal installations, bearing alignment and coupling repairs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are several facets of a comprehensive thermal inspection program. It's not limited to significant problems on the high-voltage electrical switchgear. Take a look at your program. At what level are you? Are there other ways you can take advantage of thermal analysis? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Integrating vibration and thermography in one handheld?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(This is Part 4 of a series by Ray Garvey on âChanging the way we do thermography.â The previous article are available at &lt;A href="http://www.reliableplant.com/"&gt;www.reliableplant.com&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration analysis and thermography are both commonly used walk-around data collection systems used for proactive and predictive maintenance in industrial plants. Historically, these two technologies have been separate and distinct. Vibration analysis has been performed using vibration analyzers, while thermography has been accomplished using infrared imaging camera systems. What if the two technologies could come together in a single platform? What if other dynamic signal analysis techniques like ultrasonics, magnetic flux or electrical current analysis could also be done? What if other imaging analysis techniques like borescope inspection and other two-dimensional or three-dimensional imaging techniques could be integrated with the dynamic measurements? This article invites readers to respond after considering this new world of possibilities .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infrared imagers are commonly used for thermographic inspections of equipment. State of the art for infrared inspection process involves the use of an uncooled, radiometric, focal plane array, infrared camera plus visible camera built into a lightweight, handheld package with onboard digital memory, an LCD display and interactive user interface. Visible light imaging systems are also used for inspection of equipment. Examples of such applications are borescopes, fiberscopes and even conventional video cameras.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Various dynamic measurement systems have also been developed to monitor the operational health of equipment. Examples of such systems are vibration analysis devices, sonic or ultrasonic measurement devices, and electromagnetic spectrum analyzers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Emerson Process Managementâs Machinery Health Management business has experience designing, building and selling image analysis systems used by thermographers, and also has experience with designing, building and selling dynamic signal analyzers used by vibration analysts. Even though both product lines were out of one company, no one has ever considered putting them together into a single handheld system. They were individual products for use by different people and built from very different technology bases.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In January 2006, four engineers proposed integration of these technologies into a single platform. We described practical ways to do either of these things: 1) integrate the functionality of imaging and image analysis into a handheld vibration platform, or 2) integrate the functionality of a dynamic signal analyzer into a handheld imaging system. See our U.S. Patent Application, âAutomation of imaging and dynamic signal analyses.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The engineers say it is feasible to integrate different kinds of dynamic indications measuring machinery health and imagery indications that separately measure machinery health into a single handheld platform. OK, it is practical, but who needs it to be integrated? Traditionally, image analysis and dynamic signal analysis have been performed using different technicians holding separate boxes. Is this going to change? One manager commented that putting these two things together is like building a Swiss Army knife. Most people prefer to buy dedicated, separate devices.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does it make sense to combine dynamic signal and image-type analysis in a single machinery health platform? On the one hand, you can save a lot of money by building in the shared functionality of a single handheld device. Also, the onboard software tools now make it much more practical for one person to capture the skill needed to perform both thermography and vibration analysis. In fact, many people are certified to use both. Many of the mechanical and electrical systems are best surveyed using both technologies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dynamic sensors typically employ devices such as accelerometers, piezoelectric components, electrical current or voltage probes, thermocouples, Pitot tubes, and sonic or ultrasonic detectors. Dynamic analysis or dynamic signal analysis techniques include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) vibration analysis, waveform vibration analysis, spectral vibration analysis, stress wave analysis, transient analysis, sonic analysis, ultrasonic analysis, FFT flux analysis and FFT current analysis. Such analysis generally produces one or more dynamic indications of machine health.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Functions historically performed on the display of an infrared camera include these: live thermal image, live visual image, frozen visual image, frozen thermal image, text annotation, graphic annotation, temperature at cursor points, temperature histogram, temperature profile, alarms, parameters, user instructions, etc.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How often does it make sense to use both technologies together? Table 1 presents a matrix of different combinations of sensors that may beneficially be employed to measure the health of particular components in an electrical switchyard. Matrix elements labeled âNoâ indicate that the sensor in that column is generally not applicable for inspecting the component in that row. However, under special circumstances such use may be appropriate.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Managing motors and reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Many are aware of the use of motor circuit analysis and infrared imaging in a predictive maintenance (PdM) program for motors. It is a program that, when performed properly, increases uptime, reliability and productivity, ultimately impacting the thing most managers want to see: lowered or stabilized maintenance costs. However, there may not be an understanding or awareness of the benefits and impact that an effective motor management system can have on that cost. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article will show basic key elements for a motor management system and provide an understanding of why a motor management system is much more than just a reliability and testing program. In fact, motor reliability and testing are two key components that make a significant contribution to a motor management system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure_motor1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Applied_Reli_Figure_motor1.jpg"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure_motor2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Applied_Reli_Figure_motor2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Infrared thermography is just one part of an effective motor management system. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;SHORT STORY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was once an employee who asked a lot of questions. This caused much consternation among the bosses and fellow workers. "A-ha!" the bosses thought. "We will promote him. Then he can answer his own questions!" They continued on, happily thinking this was the answer; however, to their chagrin, more questions followed. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the meantime, this newly promoted supervisor was given approximately nine hats to wear. One of them was to oversee the Motor Shop. So, where else could he start? With a bit of authority that accompanied the promotion, he created a team. A few questions got answered, a few things changed. Before anyone knew it, a motor management system began to take shape. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first six months were very difficult indeed, and another 12 rough months would pass. After 18 months, a faint glimmer of light could be seen at the end of the tunnel. Though people had fought tooth and nail against it, a few eyes began to flutter and some popped open when it was revealed that repair, inventory and purchase costs had been reduced nearly $1 million. Suddenly, the questions, ideas and actions no longer seemed so trivial. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Looking back, it was easy to see the well-traveled road littered with the debris of good intentions, false assumptions, erroneous information, etc. All this and more created a climate where bad decisions were made and money wasted. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, the first practice stopped in those first 18 months was repairing motors for $900 that only cost $200 when new. This was just the tip of the iceberg. Energy-consumption issues were later added to the equation, as well as other reliability principles and testing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WHAT IS IT? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Managing motor assets requires that a motor's location, function, repair, testing and reliability history be documented, preferably in one place. This documentation should be easily accessed for research and used to assist in making correct and appropriate repair/replace decisions. Motor testing doesn't create a motor management system, but it should be a key component. At a minimum, such a system should have the following components: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor manager: someone who is in charge and accountable &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Storage: outdoors is not acceptable &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A preferred, accountable repair facility &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Repair specifications for the repair facility to use &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A cost-saving contract for purchasing new motors from a primary vendor &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reliability testing: off-line, on-line, infrared and even vibration &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Acceptance testing of repaired motors and new motors, if possible &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tracking motors from purchase through scrap and the history in between &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A decision tree for determining repair vs. replacement &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A system to address energy consumption and efficiency &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WHO'S IN CHARGE? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The person in charge (the motor manager) doesn't have to be a motor expert; however, he or she should be somewhat knowledgeable on motor basics. This person also needs to have knowledge of the motor contract with the preferred new motor vendor and the preferred motor repair facility. The motor manager oversees all aspects of motor purchases, repairs, modifications, history and disposal. He or she should be a member of the site equipment reliability team and should interface often with the reliability manager on matters pertaining to motor testing and reliability. Managing motors doesn't have to be this person's only area of responsibility. He or she can wear other hats, as well. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once an effective motor management system has been in operation for a time, and employees and other managers become educated as to how it works, it should become easier to manage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;STORAGE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Motors never should be stored outdoors. Ideally, they should be stored in a climate-controlled facility. Climate-controlled storage facilities are rare. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Warehouse personnel are normally tasked with the day-to-day activities of normal motor storage - from receiving, issuing to and shipping to the repair shop. Personnel should be familiar with how to handle and store motors to avoid incidental damage during the storage process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Large AC motors (high voltage) sometimes need special handling and storage areas. Connect motors with internal heaters to a voltage source while in storage to keep the windings dry. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;REPAIRS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every effort should be made to identify a preferred and accountable motor repair facility within a reasonable driving distance. Preferred means a vendor that can handle just about everything that you send to it. This facility shouldn't object to inspection visits and should warranty its work in some manner and work with you on all levels of repair. Repair quality and reliability should be the guiding criteria. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A contract with a preferred repair facility can be negotiated to reduce repair cost over what it may have been. An ideal situation would be that the repair facility is also a dealer for the preferred new motor vendor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then there are the special, one-of-a-kind and non-standard motors that have to be addressed. Have you seen the suffix TY, TCY, TZ or TCZ (for instance, 286TCZ)? If so, they are the "non-standard" variety and might only be acquired from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), not the motor manufacturer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the OEM is totally out of business (not acquired by another company), a replacement motor may not be available. Having the right repair facility can come in handy with these motors. Also, by having an understanding of what alternatives are available and the knowledge of what to use as a substitute, the plant can stay running. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;NEW MOTORS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyone operating without a preferred new motor vendor contract could be losing money. A contract with a preferred new motor vendor may reduce purchase prices by 20 to 40 percent. Large corporations may already have a contract with a preferred new motor vendor. This should be followed, whenever possible, within the guidelines. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;RELIABILITY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reliability consists of many things, such as engineering, testing and inspection: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Engineering: Is the motor designed and/or repaired to perform the task it is asked to do? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Testing: motors and their circuits. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infrared: It is very important to have baseline images and stated "normal" temperatures. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration: baseline data. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When testing or inspecting a motor, it is important to ask, "Is this the motor I think it is?" or "Was this the same one that was there the last time?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor reliability and testing technician shouldn't be considered the motor manager. However, the tech is a key partner in the management of motor assets, along with maintenance managers, mechanics, warehouse people, purchasing people, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reliability and testing technician also should have a working relationship with the preferred repair vendor in order to assist in problem resolutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;DECISION TREE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every motor management system should have a decision tree. Use the tree to help you make repair or replace decisions. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most decision trees lack one important item. This is a branch or section to help determine whether a motor should be equipped with a roller bearing on the shaft end. This is a critical decision for motors driving equipment through belts. Don't construe this to mean that all motors driving belts should have a roller bearing on the shaft end. Each case should be considered separately as to whether a roller bearing would be applicable. This issue is also very important when making a purchase decision for a new motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;TRACKING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tracking a motor from birth to burial is difficult, at best. A properly functioning and effective motor management system makes it easier and can pay for itself in man-hours saved, energy efficiency, reduced inventory and (above all) reliability. A key element to tracking is assigning a unique identification to each motor. The ID should not be removable. A good practice is to engrave the unique identifier on a motor. Engravings aren't easily removed and remain legible for years of service. More often than not, they outlast the motor. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The area where the J-box is mounted normally provides a large enough surface area, as do other areas on the motor. Don't engrave end bells with the identifier in the event an end bell is replaced. The engraving should be as deep as possible and legible. Stamping is not recommended because there is a risk of cracking the casting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Relying on the nameplate for identification can be frustrating, especially if the nameplate is removed or becomes unreadable because of corrosion, etc. Motor shops often install a replacement nameplate, but only the basic information is usually put on it and other important information may be lost if not recorded elsewhere. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are a number of ways to set up an identifier, but it should be uniform and not change from year to year. For example, a numeral system based on the year and the sequence the motor arrived can be assigned along with a letter designation for the name of the site - for instance, 99-035V. The 99 means it was 1999. The 035 means it was the 35th motor identified in 1999. The V stands for the name of the plant site. If it was an older motor that had not yet been identified, it would be assigned the next sequential number. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;HISTORY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;History is a sequential documentary of the life (birth to burial) of a motor. It's a very important piece to help determine whether to repair or replace a motor. Normally, a motor stator can't withstand many burnouts and rewinds without the core becoming degraded. Without a history, it's very difficult to know how many times it has been rewound, much less what else has been done to it or where it has been. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;History can be kept in many forms (a sample is shown below) and is normally tailored to a particular site or company. Whatever form it takes, it has to be easily used and not fragmented in different places to get a complete picture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A number of motor testing systems allow for history entry and retention. However, they present some limitations in regard to documenting a complete birth-to-death history, especially if there is no formal motor management system in place. History then becomes fragmented and sometimes of little use unless diligently administered. History is the lifeblood of any motor management system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;11/15/2003 - From Repair: Acceptance ck good: Reconditioned &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;05/16/2004 - Installed: 40628972P: #2 River water pump: w/o V798642 &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note that ... &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reconditioned = Bearings, machining, cleaning, painting, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Overhauled = Rewound along with reconditioned items. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;EFFICIENCY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this day of increasing energy costs, particularly electricity, it pays to be energy conscious. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric motors consume a large percentage of electricity used in American industry. On average, approximately 63 percent of industrial electricity is consumed by electric motors. This percentage can reach 75 percent or more in certain industries. Also, motors can consume five to 12 times their initial purchase cost in energy per year. If you consider that a 25-horsepower motor, running 24/7, can consume up to $15,000 in energy per year and a 100-horsepower motor can consume up to $56,000 in energy per year, even small reductions in energy consumption per motor could result in substantial savings. Additionally, in the case of motors up to approximately 50 horsepower, the savings difference between using a standard-efficient vs. a premium-efficient motor could pay for the premium motor in one year. Every year after that would be money in the pocket. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Repair practices and quality can significantly influence energy consumption over original design. A rewound motor, especially if it was poorly done, can significantly increase energy consumption compared to the original "as built" specifications. That's a very important item to consider when making repair and replace decisions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This article doesn't outline every scenario nor address every aspect of motor management. However, the hope is that this information will be of help in developing more awareness concerning the issue of motor management and its complexities. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor management system, functioning at all levels, makes life easier, reduces cost, reduces inventory and reduces energy usage. This keeps everyone happy, including the reliability and testing technician.

            <title>How to sort infrared findings into a simple, meaningful report</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The operator performing an infrared inspection or thermographic survey collects a lot of valuable information while walking and observing.&amp;nbsp;Some of these observations are collected using the powerful infrared imaging camera, while many others are simply things seen and noted by the person doing a survey.&amp;nbsp;This article conveys practical ways to organize the findings into categories such as failure, operation and design.&amp;nbsp;Within each category, the findings are each determined to be normal, low or high alert, and low or high fault.&amp;nbsp;Faults are things that require further attention.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the third in a series of seven articles for &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt; describing how the computer software inside todayâs modern infrared cameras can do more than ever before to help the plant thermographer do his or her job far more efficiently and effectively. An automated thermographic inspection process resolves complex data into practical and understandable results or findings. A single infrared survey involves countless temperature measurements taken from thousands of components. The amount of data is immense. Without the automated thermographic inspection process, a successful inspection depends on human operators being vigilant and consistent in determining which temperature measurements are worth documenting and deciding how to report them. That process leaves room for inconsistency, missed findings and errors. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An application software routine should be used to help the thermographer resolve complex data into one of several dissimilar classifications. One approach is to classify all findings as âfailure predictions,â âoperational conditionsâ or âdesign characteristics.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fault lists may be created with each fault categorized under one or more of these classifications. For example, a relatively hot connection on a circuit breaker panel may indicate that a failure is in progress or may simply indicate that the power is flowing through that connection. If the connection is failing, the infrared inspection system can be used to monitor the progression of the failure over time and help if the condition is incipient or near late-stage catastrophic failure. It is appropriate to use multiple measurements over time to trend and thereby predict catastrophic failure. On the other hand, if the heat is simply due to power being turned on (e.g., normal operation), that fact is considered and may or may not need to be documented. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fault-tree logic in on-board software can instruct the operator to further assess and document certain operational conditions to either verify normal operation or alert to unexpected operation. Anomalies in operating conditions are quite different from anomalies associated with failure in progress, and should be classified differently. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sometimes the in-camera software is used to document observed design or quality factors. These factors are different from either failure predictions or operational conditions. For example, the insulation system in an exterior wall is supposed to have R-12 insulation. However, an infrared survey on a cold night outside the building may reveal far lower insulation is actually in place for one section of a wall. In this case, the specification or design or quality was below acceptable standard. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One step in the process of resolving complex data involves grouping faults or findings into three generally exclusive and dissimilar categories such as âfailure,â âoperationalâ and âdesign.â Another step is the assignment of alarm or severity level for each category. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Such characterizations are called grading levels, and typically this is done by assigning one of three or five different grading levels for each finding category. One implementation may describe three grading levels, like ânormal,â âalertâ and âfault.â Five grading levels may be described as âNormal,â âLow Alert,â âHigh Alert,â âLow Faultâ and âHigh Fault.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Human action or intervention is recommended when the condition reaches a particular level such as âFaultâ on the three-level method or âHigh Faultâ on the five-level method. Color indications are often used in association with alarm or severity status. Representations using grading levels and associated colors are shown in Table 1 and in figures 1 and 2. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Table 1. Grading levels and their significance. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE width=410 border=0&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD width=141&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Alarm or Severity&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD width=162&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Significance&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD width=83&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Color&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;High Fault &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The problem is extreme&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Red &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Low Fault &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Problem identified needing human action to be taken &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Red &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;High Alert &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Warning of impending action required &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Yellow &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Low Alert &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Differences are noticed &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Yellow &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Normal&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nothing unusual to report &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Green &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It really helps the operator and the people seeing his or her reports if the reporting software is used to graphically represent the status values for failure, operation and design. This could be done different ways, such as in the form of a bar graph or multi-dimensional representation. The results may simply be portrayed as a numerical dataset. For example, the results could be (1,4), (2,0), (3,2), where the first number in the set represents the category and the second number represents the grading level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A multi-vector graphical representation may be used including two or three or more dimensions. For example, in a two-vector representation, one category may be represented on the X-axis and a second category on the Y-axis of an X-Y graph. The severity level may be shown as increasing numerical values starting at the intersection (origin) with levels of alarm or severity increasing as the distance from the origin increases. A tri-vector representation adds a third dimension to the graphical representation using a radar-type plot. An example of a tri-vector graphical representation is shown in Figure 1. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is possible and practical to integrate findings from alternate sources in addition to infrared inspection information into a multi-category format. For example, one may record observations including process variables such as temperature, pressure and flow conditions while accomplishing infrared surveys. These operational conditions can contribute to the overall findings. The same can be applied to information or data gained from associated condition monitoring information such as vibration analysis or ultrasonic analysis or oil analysis information. All of these can be interpreted in a structure like that shown in the Table 1. Those findings can be accumulated along with infrared observations during an infrared survey. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Generally, all of the findings associated with each classification category are considered in the assignment of an overall severity level for each category, in other words for âfailure,â âoperationâ and âdesign.â Normally, when multiple parameters or anomalies in one category are considered, the highest one determines the overall level. However, to avoid nuisance alarming, false negatives and false positives, consideration may be given to multiple measurements, data and information from various sources when determining the overall values for each of these three categories. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By resolving the complex data from infrared surveys into these three dimensions (categories) and assigning a grading level to each, anyone who reads the report can easily interpret the significance of the findings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A huge advantage for this approach to thermographic inspection is an automated reporting process that is far beyond what could be done earlier. Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word or other type reports may be fully formatted in the portable IR system at the completion of the area survey. Two examples of one page of a report are provided in figures 1 and 2. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article is based on things first disclosed in Garvey, et. al., U.S. Patent Application SN 10/872,041, "Method of Automating a Thermographic Inspection Process."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/fhskUA2_p-s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IR inspection helps avoid catastrophe</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Reliability in Action department features case studies submitted by our readers. To have your case study considered for inclusion in an upcoming issue, e-mail it to parnold@noria.com or mail it to Reliable Plant, P.O. Box 87, Fort Atkinson, WI 53538. If we publish your case study, we'll send you an official Reliable Plant T-shirt. Here is this issue's highlighted contribution:&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On a routine quarterly infrared inspection of plant electrical power distribution equipment, a high-voltage switch for a transformer was found arcing to the insulation board. A quick and effective response to the dangerous condition avoided a catastrophe at the plant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The environment at the plant is very humid and the physical assets are 30 years old. The quarterly infrared inspections of electrical distribution equipment routinely reveal significant problems that were not present in the previous inspection. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During one such infrared inspection over the summer, a 12,500-volt disconnect switch for a transformer on the plant roof was found arcing from the switch to an insulation board. Even with a low temperature difference between the fault and the reference temperature - 7 degrees Fahrenheit in this case - this condition had the potential to start a fire in the transformer and cause an explosion if the arcing burned through the insulation board and arced to ground. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The thermographer understood the seriousness of the fault and immediately reported the condition to the plant maintenance manager. After consultation with high-voltage experts, a controlled shutdown was planned to repair the arcing condition and minimize process losses. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The repair was completed within 48 hours of detection without incident and the plant was brought back on line with only about six hours at a reduced rate. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a great example of a serious fault with a small temperature difference across components. It also shows the importance of the thermographer understanding the system being inspected and the potential consequences of failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this case, the effective infrared inspection program undoubtedly avoided a catastrophic situation. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1 shows digital and thermographic images of the back of the disconnect switch before repair. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2 is the digital image of the insulation board where the arcing situation was occurring. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/infrared_thermography/~4/jD6tkHSIh4s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IR: In-camera training and certification</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Do you ever wish that your thermography trainer would walk along with you and answer questions while you are in the field doing an infrared survey or route? Now that would be real on-the-job training! In a classroom situation, you have to imagine what the real world is like. Wouldn't it be better to take classroom training out to the field? What if there was a way to ask your infrared camera a question and it could tell you the answer? Let's go one step farther. What if the infrared camera could ask you, the thermographer, a question to see if you understand what you must know to do your job, and if there was something you didn't understand, the camera could tell you all about it? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infrared imagers are more capable, less expensive and easier to use than ever. Technical advances over the past 20 years have enabled more people, having less training, to walk through plants doing infrared surveys. This article shows how very important it is for training and testing to be included in the firmware of the infrared imaging camera.1 &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Operator proficiency application software" is a formal way to describe imbedded training inside your infrared camera. This is a must-have feature. It is especially important if you want a new guy to pick up the camera and get started using it. Even the experienced thermographer will find this useful if it teaches about parts of the plant that are new or applications and equipment with which he or she may not yet be familiar. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 2004, Raytek (now Fluke) began shipping a 309-image presentation entitled, "Learning to use the ThermoView Ti30." This informative, personal-computer-based training was provided in five European languages and two Far Eastern languages. Wow! This was definitely a step in the right direction to get more people with less experience using infrared technology in their daily jobs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The customer would be better served if the following portions of that particular course can be imbedded in the cameras for in-field reference: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Operation of the imager to get quality images and meaningful radiometric data. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Examples of thermal reflections and ways to interpret images with reflections. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Best uses of the imager considering perspective, angle of view, spatial resolution and measurement resolution. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Examples of techniques, findings and reports for various electrical inspections (or building or fire or mechanical or other type of inspections for which the particular camera is well-suited). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How to use the infrared imager in non-destructive testing applications. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Process monitoring methods, capabilities, limitations and reporting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Safe operation. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is even more that can and should be done to build training inside the infrared imagers. Within each plant or industry there are systematic problems. Those are the ones that come up over and over again. In-camera training can teach operators about those things for which to be on the lookout. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied-Reli---Infrared2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200701_Applied-Reli---Infrared2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. Example of in-camera training &lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;on a transformer cooling system. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;STANDARDS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;AND TESTING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Plants that never owned an infrared camera now have several of them, and each one may have two or three different operators. These cameras are entirely adjustable, and people using them can do surveys many different ways. This flexibility creates problems unless operators are trained to do their inspections following a standard practice. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ideally, you should be able to send three of the operators into a switchyard, expecting each will come back with the same faults documented, without false positive or false negative findings. To achieve this result, it's critically important to define the inspection process as a survey or route or both (see "What's the difference between a survey and a route", &lt;I&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/I&gt;, November/December 2006 issue). It's also important to train the operators on how to perform the inspection. Finally, you will know that the training is done when each operator passes a test of some sort. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows a sample graphic diagram for in-camera teaching about the operation and inspection of a transformer cooling system. Text or audio description accompanying this figure includes: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1) system function &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2) unique characteristics &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3) infrared inspection and analysis, and &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;4) relevant notes or warnings &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In-camera training without in-camera testing may satisfy a requirement to "cover the material," but it may not achieve the desired operator understanding. After training (or before, if you want to "test out"), the operator proficiency application software can prompt the operator to respond to a relevant question. Since the objective is to achieve a level of proficiency, any wrong response should link back to the portion of training media containing the correct information. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Safety is the highest priority in nearly all plant situations. Many plants require newcomers, particularly visitors, to observe a short video and take a brief test covering selected hazardous operations and safety protocol. Imagers are carried directly into some of the most dangerous parts of the plant. The infrared operator often has both hands and both eyes fully engaged with imager operation. This creates a need for special safety instructions to the infrared camera operator. Relevant safety training and associated testing should be part of an in-camera operator proficiency application. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;TECHNICAL &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;REQUIREMENTS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;User interface is a serious limitation. Electronic training media developed for personal computers may not be directly suitable for imbedded, in-camera applications. Computers have hundreds of key selection and cursor movement options. Some infrared imagers only have an on/off switch. Most have other buttons and some kind of cursor control. Computer displays are also expansive compared to typical imagers. Computer speakers and microphones may also be more capable than one finds on infrared imagers. These things should all be considered when designing the imbedded training and testing applications. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Where do you find the content for in-camera training applications? You find it in the same places you find classroom training content. Google will turn up hundreds of selections on any given topic. By the way, this is an excellent next-generation feature for in-camera connectivity - wireless to the Internet. Not only does this open the way for finding and downloading training and certification applications, it paves the way for uploading survey results and reports.2 &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With operator proficiency application software, new people can quickly learn the basics and, when ready, move on to more challenging infrared inspection tasks. In-camera testing provides advantages as well, not the least of which is certification of operator awareness of lockout/tagout and other critically important safety issues. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>NFPA70E, arc flash, and safe and efficient thermography practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt; Estimates indicate that 10 to 15 serious arc flash incidents &amp;ndash; those that result in burn injuries requiring treatment in a burn center &amp;ndash; occur each day in the U.S., so it is not surprising that awareness of the hazards associated with arc flash continues to grow. Concerns about operator safety in the event of an arc flash are causing inspectors of high-voltage switchgear to adopt new practices. We will examine the impact of new safety practices &amp;ndash; including infrared transparent windows and PPE (personal protective equipment) &amp;ndash; on the use of thermography inspection. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;em&gt; What is an Arc Flash?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  An Arc flash is essentially a bolt of lightning that occurs around energized electrical equipment. It can occur spontaneously and is often triggered simply by the movement of air when an electrical enclosure is opened. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) has recognized the significant hazard of arc flash and is attempting to protect workers via the latest implementation of &amp;ldquo;NFPA 70E - The Standard for Employee Safety in the Workplace&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Every person who has worked around energized electrical equipment is familiar with arc flash &amp;ndash; most have seen it first hand. But it is kind of like a major automobile accident: No one really expects it to happen to them, so people have a tendency to drive with significantly less caution than they should. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
So it is with arc flash, only worse. Similar to driving, you can make a mistake, or you can be doing everything right when someone slams into you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Specifically, what is an arc flash? An arc flash is electric current flowing through an arc outside its normal path where air becomes the conductor of high thermal energy (more than 5,000 degrees Celsius) and generates highly conductive plasma. An arc flash will conduct all available energy and generate an explosive volumetric increase of gases which blows electrical system doors off and potentially generates shrapnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What are the causes of arc flash? An arc flash occurs when the gap between conductors or conductors and ground is momentarily bridged. There is always a trigger event which almost always involves human intervention. Typical causes and contributing factors include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Accidental contact with energized parts &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Inadequate short circuit ratings &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Tracking across insulation surfaces &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Tools dropped on energized parts &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Wiring errors &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Contamination, such as dust on insulating surfaces &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Corrosion of equipment parts and contacts &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Improper work procedures &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The vast majority of arc faults occur when the door is open or being opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The National Fire Protection Agency is the author of NFPA 70, also known as the National Electric Code (NEC). The NEC is an electrical design, installation and inspection standard, and does not specifically address things like electrical maintenance and safe work practices. A national consensus was needed for safety while working around live electrical equipment. NFPA 70 E is the standard for safe electrical work practices. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  NFPA 70 E addresses specific topics: safety-related work practices, safety-related maintenance practices and safety requirements for special equipment. Some of this relates to thermography, which will be addressed later. NFPA 70 suggests that a hazard/risk analysis be conducted prior to working on electrical equipment. The core of the analysis is based on shock and arc flash boundaries which must be done by a qualified electrical engineer. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shock Hazards, Flash Hazards and PPE Selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  In order to work around live components, the correct personal protective equipment must be determined by carrying out a shock hazard analysis and a flash hazard analysis. Where this is not possible or has not been done, Table 130.7(C)(9)(a) can be used to determine the required PPE based on the task conducted. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  In order to work around live components, an Energized Electrical Work Permit must be obtained and should include but not be limited to the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; A description of the circuit, the equipment to be worked on and the location &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Justification why the work must be performed in an energized condition &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Description of the safe work practices to be performed &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Results of the shock hazard analysis &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Determination of the shock protection boundaries &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Results of the flash hazard analysis &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The flash protection boundary &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Identify the necessary PPE to safely perform the assigned task &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Means employed to restrict unqualified personnel from the work area &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Evidence of completion of a job briefing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Energized work approval from responsible management, safety officer, owner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; NFPA 70 E allows for an exemption to the safe work permit for qualified personnel who are performing tasks such as testing, troubleshooting, voltage measuring, etc., so long as they utilize safe work practices and the correct PPE. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  In either case, it is necessary to perform a shock hazard analysis and a flash hazard analysis to help determine safe working practice and proper PPE. A shock hazard analysis will determine the voltage to which personnel are exposed, boundary requirements and the proper PPE necessary to minimize the possibility of shock to personnel. The shock protection boundaries are identified as limited, restricted and prohibited for the distances associated with various voltages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; System Voltage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limited Approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Restricted Approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prohibited Approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; 7&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; 10&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; 17&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Unqualified personnel will be notified and warned of hazards by qualified personnel when working at or near the limited approach boundary. When an unqualified person must work inside the restricted boundary, they will be further notified of the risks and hazards and continuously escorted by a qualified person. Under no circumstances will they be allowed inside the prohibited boundary. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  A flash hazard analysis will be conducted in order to protect personnel from being injured by an arc flash. The analysis will determine the flash protection boundary and determine the proper PPE. The flash protection boundary is calculated at the distance from energized parts where a burn will be &amp;quot;recoverable&amp;quot; (second degree) and &amp;quot;incurable&amp;quot; (third degree). &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  The flash protection boundary for systems that are 600 volts or less shall be 4 feet for clearing times of 6 cycles (.1 second) and available bolted fault current of 50kA or any combination not exceeding 300kA cycles. For all other clearing times and bolted fault currents, the flash protection boundary will be determined based on the calculated incident energy of an arc fault taking into account system voltage, available current, and clearing time, where incident energy is the measure of thermal energy at a specific distance from the fault. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Selection of PPE by task is allowed in lieu of a flash hazard study. However, for tasks not listed in table 130.7(C)(9)(a) and for clearing times different then those listed there, a complete flash hazard analysis is required. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
A selection from table 130.7(C)(9)(a):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 600-volt class switchgear (with power circuit breakers or fused switches) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; CB or fused switch operation with enclosure doors closed 0 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Reading a panel meter while operating a meter switch 0 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; CB or fused switch operation with enclosure doors open 1 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Work on energized parts, including voltage testing 2* &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Work on control circuits with energized parts 120 V or below, exposed 0 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Work on control circuits with energized parts &amp;gt;120 V, exposed 2* &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Insertion or removal (racking) of CBs from cubicles, doors open 3 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Insertion or removal (racking) of CBs from cubicles, doors closed 2 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Application of safety grounds, after voltage test 2* &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Removal of bolted covers (to expose bare, energized parts) 3 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Opening hinged covers (to expose bare, energized parts) 2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Note: Above 600 V, removal of bolted covers (to expose bare, energized parts) carries a Class 4 (scale 0 to 4, where 4 is determined the riskiest) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Using flash hazard analysis or task risk assessment the following table can be used to identify the correct PPE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton underwear, FR pants and LS shirt, hard hat, arc rated face shield or flash hood, leather gloves and shoes, hearing protection &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 8.01 - 25.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton underwear, FR pants and LS shirt plus FR coverall, hard hat, arc rated flash hood, leather gloves and shoes, hearing protection &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cotton underwear, FR pants and LS shirt plus multi-layer flash suit, hard hat, arc rated flash hood, leather gloves and shoes, hearing protection &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Thermography Inspection Practices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Electrical IR Practices Prior to NFPA 70e: Infrared cameras have been used to identify problems in electrical systems for many years. Problems in electrical systems manifest themselves by heating. An infrared camera can readily identify these problems in a thermal image,which provides an excellent method of identifying failing or problem components prior to a failure. A failure can disable an electrical system and cause significant lost production, equipment damage and bodily injury. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  Infrared electrical inspection has been used by the insurance companies to help determine insurability and rates for industry for many years. More recently,users of infrared have found that they can use IR to prevent and predict failures to help further reduce down time equipment failure and increase overall safety. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Infrared cameras are based on digital camera technology and require a direct line of site to record an accurate image. In most cases, surveys are hampered by cabinet designs that obscure the target components being imaged and thermographers are put at risk by having to open cabinets or doors in an attempt to gain access to the internal components that they wish to image. IR surveys of electrical systems are most valuable when the system is under heavy if not peak electrical load, which requires the thermographer to perform the inspection in and around live electrical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Typically, electrical system covers will be bolted in place and are removed while the inspection is underway and then replaced. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  This working method comes in conflict with the requirements of NFPA70 &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations of NFPA70e as they relate to IR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  One way that NFPA 70 E determines hazard and risk is based on the activity that you are conducting around the equipment. The scale is from zero to 4, where 4 has the highest risk potential. For example, removal of a bolted cover on 600-volt equipment carries a hazard/risk classification of 3 and that goes up to a 4 on anything greater than 600 volts. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  As this work occurs within the flash protection boundary, the appropriate PPE must be worn. The required minimum PPE for Hazard/Risk Classification 3 work is to withstand 104.6 J/cm and the required minimum PPE for Hazard/Risk Classification 4 work is to withstand 167.36 J/cm. As much of the work performed for an IR inspection requires removal of bolted covers, this is the PPE that is required. Additionally, NFPA70e recommends that only &amp;quot;qualified&amp;quot; personnel be allowed to perform work inside the flash protection boundary. A thermographer must be accompanied by a &amp;quot;qualified&amp;quot; person to remove covers. Both the thermographer and the additional person should be in full PPE. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrared Windows - Eliminate the Controllable Risk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  The first rule in any risk assessment is to eliminate the risk if possible; PPE is always a last resort! Infrared windows eliminate the risks associated with live inspections as they allow an infrared camera direct line-of-site access to live electrical components without opening an electrical enclosure. As such, they provide an excellent means of accessing electrical equipment efficiently and safely as a second qualified person is not required to open and unbolt enclosures and the &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot; of arc flash are not introduced as the panels remain closed. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  An IR window sounds more complicated than it really is, and although there are several types of window available on the market today, there is nothing stopping the thermographer from designing a window for use in any particular inspection that they may wish to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  An IR viewing window is basically an optic material that allows IR energy to pass through it and a holder/body; thermographers may even decide not to use a crystal if the energized component that you are interested in is some distance from the cover and a protective grill can be used in place of the crystal. You must, however, ensure that the grill is IP2X certified &amp;ndash; that is, the grill size must offer protection against foreign objects with diameters larger than 12 millimeters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This method can significantly reduce the capital expenditure required and also has the additional benefits of allowing ultrasound inspections of the electrical switchgear as well as thermographic inspections. However, when using grills, operators will be exposed to live electrical components and as such will be required to wear the appropriate level of PPE identified from the arc flash hazard analysis of the switchgear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optics holder design depends upon a number of parameters; the field of view, equipment lens and window size are all functions of the design and must meet all the parameters that the thermographer requires before a holder is manufactured. Also, a protective cover should be included in the design as crystals are very expensive and, in some cases, extremely fragile. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
An infrared window allows a thermographer to inspect the inside of the electrical enclosure without having to open or unbolt an enclosure door. As discussed earlier in this paper, the vast majority of arc incidents are triggered due to accidental contact, items dropping in and a change of state (introduction of air, dirt, moisture). By keeping the door closed and sealed by inspecting with an infrared window, you have eliminated the controllable items that induce arc flash. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Infrared windows are available in multiple sizes and can be custom-made to retrofit dead fronts on distribution and isolator boards. The larger the size of the window, the greater the field of view one can see with the IR camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;IRISS Infrared Windows&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_electro1.jpg" width="250" height="202" align="right"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Available in 2-, 3- and 4-inch diameters &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; UL - CUL recognized &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Constructed to IEEE C.37.20.2 a.3.6 for Viewing Panes in MV and HV Equipment &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Greater than NEMA 4 open and closed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Where do I locate Infrared Windows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  To correctly install infrared windows, the targets that require inspection must be identified. Traditional surveys commonly only look at the bolted connections within the switchgear, as these are generally considered to be the &amp;quot;weakest points&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;points most likely to fail.&amp;quot; These may include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Cable connections &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Bus bar connections &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Isolator or circuit breaker connections &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Once a decision has been made on what you require to see through your IR window, you will need to decide on what size of IR window you require, and where you need to install it to ensure maximum coverage and therefore maximum efficiency.&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_electro2.gif" width="250" height="228" align="right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The formula for calculating the field of view (FOV) through an IR Window is: &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  2 x the tangent of one-half the angle x distance&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Typically, infrared cameras have a standard FOV of approx 20 to 25 degrees in the horizontal, and 15 to 20 degrees in the vertical. Optional wide-angle lenses are typically two times the field of view, or about 50 degrees horizontal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Another important consideration is to manipulate the camera when looking through an IR window. This has the effect of increasing what can be seen by up to a factor of three. This means that if your target is 12 inches across, you can reduce this to 4 inches (for IR window size calculation purposes) to allow for the additional area that will be seen when you manipulate the camera from left to right or up and down. &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  Once you have identified your required component identification and FOV calculations, you will be able to identify fairly accurately the number and size of IR windows that you require. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; 50-degree wide-angle lens can focus at 2 inches &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Small 1-inch-diameter lens enables the camera to work well with inexpensive 2-inch windows. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Motorized lens eliminates the need to get fingers on lens focus ring. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Articulating camera allows you to look into windows above eye level or at near floor level. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; What Can I See Through an Infrared Window?&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt; An infrared window allows you to inspect the inside of an electrical cabinet to check the physical condition of the components that you have chosen to inspect. As with traditional thermographic inspections, we can see temperature differences very clearly. However, when trying to survey components that do not have any faults, very little load and are at the same temperature, you will see very little if anything at all.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_electro6.jpg" width="400" height="287"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  Figure 7. Images taken through IR windows showing issues due to load imbalance, connections, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;You need to have the confidence in the infrared windows that you are using. They are designed to allow infrared energy to transmit through them at a known transmission rate. Therefore, if there is even a slight temperature difference, you will be able to see that with your IR camera, and be able to record images for the IR inspection trend analysis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; How do I Use Infrared Windows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  An important thing to remember when using IR windows is to identify the window with a unique number. This will be invaluable, especially when you have multiple windows on electrical panels, etc. It is also advisable to identify the type and wavelength of the infrared window material. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  The most essential data to record is the transmission rate of the crystal and also the emissivity of the component or components that you are measuring through the IR window. The most effective way of using IR windows is to (as discussed earlier) prepare all components that are inspected so as they have the same emissivity with electrical tape, paint, IR-ID labels, etc Thus, all components being inspected will have the same transmission rate and emissivity readings; consequently, the results gathered will be far more accurate. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; How Do I Install Infrared Windows?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Installing an infrared window means cutting holes into very expensive switchgear, and before we complete this exercise, we need to be very sure that we are installing them in the correct place and that the switchgear ratings are not degraded in any way. This is not as daunting as it may sound. You should have already worked out how many windows you need, what IR windows you intend to use and where you want to put them. However, before we start the installation, we need to be sure of the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; NEMA or IP rating of the switchgear and IR windows: Remember that you must never install an IR window of a lower rating than the rating of the switchgear. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Test certifications: You must ensure that the IR windows have been tested and approved by the certification bodies as the switchgear that you intend to fit them into, i.e. UL, IEEE. Lloyds, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Internal obstacles: Before you remove internal Perspex/Plexiglas covers or cables, ensure that the local safety manager's approval is obtained first. In some cases, you may not be able to remove the covers totally and may only be able to modify the covers by drilling or punching holes to retain the IP2X requirement for some switchgear. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Explosion ratings (if applicable): Some panels are positioned in intrinsically safe areas and as such can never be modified in the field. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Dielectric clearances: Where IR windows use grills or inspection orifices, they must comply with IP2X (13 millimeters, or 0.5 inches), and clients must be made aware of the safe dielectric clearances for the type of switchgear that they intend to install the window into. IEEE C37.20.2 Table A.3 has minimum distances from live components and it is recommended that these be considered as a standard for grills/inspection orifices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; Rated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        Maximum Voltage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td colspan="2"&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; Clearance &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; kV &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; In &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; Cm &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 4.76 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 5.5 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 14 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 8.25 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 6.5 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 17 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 15.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 8.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 20 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 27.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 12.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 30 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 38.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 15.0 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; 36 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;em&gt; Can IR Windows Carry a Generic Arc Rating?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Electrical switchgear comes in infinite shapes and sizes, and as such the surface areas and volumetric elements of the cabinets are different with each model, type and rating. Each cabinet is subject to the testing that is laid down by the certification bodies such as UL, IEEE, etc. This test is completed on the cabinet assemblies. When the testing is completed, the compliance is awarded to the assembly and not the components that make up the assembly. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
A simple way of viewing this is to calculate the force that would be experienced on the surface of an electrical cabinet while undergoing an arc flash explosion test. The pressure exerted on a surface by a given force is determined by using the area over which that force acts. The formula to be used is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_electro8.gif" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  For the purposes of these calculations, we are assuming that an arc flash explosion causes a uniform increase in pressure across the entire inside area of the chamber. However, you should note that pressure also increases with temperature, and so in an explosion where temperature increases, this would make these cases even more extreme, especially in smaller chambers. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Therefore, for a given force x, the pressure is inversely proportional to the area and hence as the area over which the force acts decreases the pressure will increase. This relationship can be seen in the graph above. This shows that if the force or explosion remains constant but the chamber and hence the area gets smaller, the pressure on each part of the chamber goes up according to the relationship shown. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  Electrical cabinet designs and dimensions are infinite. We, therefore, CANNOT or MUST NOT use the data from one cabinet design to another design unless they are identical in every way. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  This is the reason why components can never carry a generic arc rating and must be subjected to industry standard tests to confirm that they conform to the minimum required level of mechanical strength and environmental properties for the electrical cabinets and assemblies which they are going to be fitted into. &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>IR: What's a survey? What's a route?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;This is the first in a series of articles addressing the application of modern infrared cameras to in-plant thermography. This particular article answers the question "What is the difference between a survey and a route?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Routes were first introduced into plant thermographic inspection procedures in 1993. Route-based data collection is commonly used for walkaround vibration analysis, preventive maintenance inspections and other step-by-step procedures. This sequential process is intended to collect thermal information by periodically inspecting the same point on an equipment or machinery asset. An underlying database is used to track and trend problems and corrective actions. The in-field inspection system includes equipment information and fault tree logic that prompts the thermographer through a process. The result is a fully documented inspection with automatic reporting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many infrared thermographers are inclined to use a survey-based inspection approach instead of, or in addition to, a route-based program. Surveys, like routes, may be sequential, but not necessarily. In a survey, you normally walk up to an area and inspect around that area. So, a survey is most often the process of inspecting the vicinity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let me use an everyday example to demonstrate the differences between surveys and routes. My wife is a route-based shopper; whereas, I am a survey-based shopper. Before she goes shopping, my wife draws up a shopping list. She notes a shopping item in the middle of the page, then one on the top quarter, and another on the end of the list-in-progress. She knows the order that products will be seen as she walks the aisles of a favorite store, and she puts things listed in order by where they will be found on the shelves. Since she shops frequently at the same store, this process is very efficient. It allows her to gather just the items she needs and avoid impulse buying. The process keeps her coming back to the same store, even if it means driving past others that are laid-out differently. If she hands me her list and sends me off to shop, I will say, "thank you very much," and find it easy to follow. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;TABLE class=sidebar cellPadding=5 align=center&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=sidebarheader&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;Changing the Way we Do Thermography &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=sidebar&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Highly computerized, in-plant thermography systems were introduced in the early 1990s. These early systems were heavy and expensive ($50,000 to $100,000). Excellent performance, high price and modest complexity caused early systems to be most effectively used at progressive, large-scale industrial plants. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the decade since, infrared camera technology has advanced, largely due to the availability of reliable, affordable, uncooled imaging arrays. There are new vendors and lower prices. Today, we're immersed in "IR Wars," where dozens of vendors are competing to supply IR cameras to an expanding market. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Today, an excellent thermography system will fit in the palm of your hand and cost $10,000 to $40,000, depending on the source and feature set. The trend to less expensive and smaller, more ergonomic and versatile computerized thermography systems continues. Prices are still dropping while camera system performance and reliability are maintained. For the first time ever, you can now choose from more than a dozen different makes and many more different models to get your IR camera system suited to your particular needs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Size, weight and price make IR camera systems available to more people who look at more applications than ever before. The ongoing hardware war between suppliers provides tremendous performance and value to you. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Without question, the computerization of IR imaging systems and the production of reliable, high-performance uncooled detector arrays has changed and expanded the many ways that infrared thermography is done. But the war is far from over, and consumers have much more to gain from the continuing saga. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So, what's next? What you haven't seen yet is the competition around in-camera software capabilities. In-camera computer applications will continue to make a big difference to you. &lt;I&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/I&gt; will publish a series of articles describing the ways that the computational features of thermography systems will advance, further changing the way the world performs thermography. Topics will include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1)"What's the difference between a survey and a route?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2)"What's the value of in-camera training and certification?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3)"How can you sort a myriad of findings into a simple, meaningful report?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;4)"What if you could integrate vibration and thermography into one platform?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5)"How do you size things up using an IR imaging system?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;6)"Why not calculate R-value, heat loss &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, if it's up to me to write out the list, there is absolutely no way I could organize the route-based shopping list. I don't know, and will never know, the organization of the store. I don't enter the same store often enough. Everything gets moved around. So, what I employ is a survey-based shopping method. I make a list of the things I want to consider buying and look in my wallet to know my spending limit. I then go through the doors of a preferred store and read the signs. Some signs hang from the ceiling or at the ends of aisles. Some signs are in the form of a store or shopping mall layout. Other signs are more intuitive, considering customary ways that store owners group things together. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The system I follow is a survey. To do a survey, I enter an area where I expect to find an item of interest, and then I inspect that area. By the way, the store owners know this tendency many shoppers have to "survey," so they put stuff out that will grab the attention of impulse buyers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What does this have to do with thermographic inspections? I find that thermographers generally prefer to use the survey-based method. That means a thermographer selects an area, such as a switchyard, and walks through the area looking for things. It's not a point-by-point thing; the thermographer covers much new ground each year. Vibration routes are walked every month, whereas infrared surveys are far less frequent and far less point specific. Then the surveying thermographer has a defined list of tasks that must be performed or inspected during the survey of an area. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some people mix route and survey methods together. An advantage of this is that routes provide records of all things inspected, normal and unusual. Surveys tend to be more exception-based, although this is not always the case. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infrared thermographers have always done surveys, so what's new? The new thing is the use of survey templates to assist with the inspection. Figure 1 shows four different kinds of survey templates that can be programmed into computerized infrared camera systems: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Sequence of inspection requirements 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;May prompt visual inspection or photo 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;May prompt "Warning!" 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Physical layout in the vicinity of the area to be inspected 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Task checklist 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Location of a component within a system 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied-Reli---IR-Figure-1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Applied-Reli---IR-Figure-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. Four kinds of survey templates prompt&lt;BR&gt;the infrared inspector. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/ARTICLE&gt;All modern infrared imaging systems have imbedded computers driving graphical displays. There are a number of things that this display can be used for to prompt the operator through the inspection process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Survey templates may include things like a plant-floor layout, an aerial photograph, an annotated diagram or a photograph of equipment to be inspected. For example, Figure 2 is a line drawing showing components, transmission lines, and connections surrounding a particular transformer and circuit breaker. With this information in hand, the infrared thermographer is better able to perform the inspection and to fully interpret the nature and consequence of problems detected. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied-Reli---IR-Figure-2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Applied-Reli---IR-Figure-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. This line drawing shows components, lines and&lt;BR&gt;connections surrounding a transformer and circuit breaker. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One major advantage for using survey templates is the way this helps standardize a process that is going to be used by several people or for use in a variety of areas. Here are three other tips to assist inspectors in performing efficient, effective and safe infrared surveys. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Get trained and certified. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Document your findings for easy reporting and follow-up. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Carry tags in your pocket; mark things found so others can come back to the same exact location. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In summary, routes are sequential, measurement point to measurement point. They provide an easy way to annotate every item inspected, whether or not any findings are noted. They are best suited for regular, monthly inspections. Surveys are conducive to inspecting an area; they do not necessarily have to be point-to-point. Survey templates can be used to navigate a thermographer through an inspection process. Templates can be a high-level view of the plant, a close-up perspective of an equipment system or a series of prompts to help the infrared inspector do the survey correctly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <description>&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The world of 
thermography is expanding faster than ever before, with new applications, 
markets and cameras. More and more maintenance practitioners are putting this 
remarkable technology to use as one of the tools in their pouch. As this trend 
grows, infrared (IR) camera suppliers have responded with great new products 
that are lighter, smaller, easier to use and less expensive than ever 
imagined.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;One thing that has not 
changed, though, is the need to have a solid basic knowledge, grounded in 
experience, in order to successfully interpret the images produced by these 
remarkable cameras. Unfortunately, many believe they can skip over this 
essential step and jump right to being an âexpert.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN

can be used in conventional visual cameras, is sensitive to much shorter

Imagine a room with no light and everything having a temperature of 30 degrees C 
(86Â°F). If we began to heat an electric hotplate in the room, we could see it 
with an infrared camera when it reached 30.01 C (86.02Â°F). To see the same 
object with infrared film, it would need to be heated to 230 C (446Â°F). Of 
course, by the time it reaches about 550 C (1022Â°F), we can see it with our eyes

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In this age of 
Internet pseudo-science, many people have come to believe you can âsee through 
wallsâ with infrared cameras. However, it is not possible; in fact, it is also 
impossible to see through the clear plastic âtouch-safeâ panels found inside 
many control cabinets.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;To reliably detect 
problems, enclosures must be opened and panels removed. A hot spot inside may 
eventually produce enough heat to produce a thermal signature on the unopened 
enclosure, but in many cases, it still canât be detected due to ambient 
conditions. Even if it is detected, the internal&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;damage is, by then, 
typically well advanced. The thermal image (Photo 2) shows approximately a 15Â°C 
(27 F) rise over normal on the outside of the enclosure. As can be seen in the 
visual image (Photo 3) of the interior, the copper busbar had heated to the 
point where it was severely damaged.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Infrared transparent windows and 
view ports may offer an alternative means of seeing inside enclosures without 
opening the covers. The plastic âtouch safeâ interior panels are still a 
problem, regardless, as they are opaque to infrared 
radiation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The visual equivalent 
of this question would be to ask âWhat is the color blue?â There are many 
choices. The exact surface of copper can vary just as widely as the color blue 
and, in each case, a different emissivity correction value would be needed. Even 
when we define the surface more precisely, such as âhighly polished copper,â 
there can be significant variations in emissivity.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Does it matter? Yes. 
Especially for a surface with a relatively low emissivity, using an incorrect 
value can make a large difference in the temperature value obtained. Too many 
thermographers believe, incorrectly, that if they simply input the right 
correction value from a table (some of which may be in the camera software 
itself), all will be well. These tables may be useful as guides, but they canât 
replace critical thinking.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P &gt;&lt;SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Itâs not uncommon to 
find a wide range of temperature indications of abnormal situations. As an 
example, all of the containers in the thermal image (Photo 4) contain water at 
the same hot temperature, but the surface temperatures vary widely for each. The 
same is true of the machinery we look at during an 
inspection.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Temperature and 
thermal patterns are useful information, but without an understanding of the 
criticality of the asset, no rational determination can be made of how to 
prioritize a finding. In fact, conditions can easily be such that an indication 
of serious concern may be so subtle as to be undetectable. Take great care, 
therefore, to ensure that conditions are sufficient to locate any anomalies that 
might exist.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

of infrared cameras often donât fully understood the camera âspec sheet.â Sales 
people can easily make you believe a specification (one their system has) is 
critical while glossing over other details. Itâs vital to understand what each 
specification actually means and how it affects your use of the camera in your 
plant.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Spatial resolution is 
getting plenty of press lately as newer, lower-cost cameras come on the market 
with lower resolution than has ever been offered. In fact, many of these perform 
quite well for many (but not all) condition monitoring (CM) applications. If you 
can get closer to the equipment being inspected, resolution may not be an 
issue.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Resolution also 
affects field of view (FOV). This is the area you see though the lens at a given 
distance. In many instances, access is limited, and knowing what the minimum 
focus distance is may be critical to success. The bottom line is to understand 
specifications and your real needs before you look at what camera to

used to locate anomalies. Once detected, temperature values may be useful as 
well, but typically, information from other technologies (vibration, ultrasound

            <title>Infrared detector resolution: How important is it?</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Until recently, most buyers of infrared imaging cameras had to make a budgeting choice between a low-resolution 160x120-pixel camera or no camera at all, but they soon learned they missed a lot at low resolution. Starting at about $25,000 and going up from there, professional high-resolution 320x240-pixel cameras were too costly for anyone who was not a full-time thermographer or not working for a company that could afford to buy expensive tools that might be underutilized.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;That changed in 2005 with the introduction of cameras costing less than $15,000 that use a high-performance 320x240 microbolometer detector. Still, many users want to know: Why is higher resolution important in thermal imaging? Why have the professional thermographers always been willing to pay the premium for the 320x240-pixel detectors used in uncooled, focal-plane-array cameras?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Pixels are the data acquisition points for thermal measurement, and this data is used to create a visual image from the thermal profile.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;âMore data points mean more information is provided for accurate thermal interpretation. More pixels also mean greater visual resolution in the thermal image. So for a given field of view, smaller details can be identified in the thermal image and accurately measured for temperature,â says Jon Chynoweth, vice president of Mikron Infrared.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Chynoweth says that to make IR cameras affordable to a wider range of users, detectors with pixel counts of 160x120, with or without interpolation, were introduced as a low-cost alternative. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;âBut this is one-fourth the resolution of the 320x240 detector: 76,800 pixels vs. 19,200,â he says. âThe larger detector produces an image twice as wide and twice as high, with four times the data for a given field of view.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;For the working thermographer, high resolution allows a camera to work at a much greater distance from a target without loss of temperature measurement accuracy, Chynoweth explains. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;âA target must cover at least 9 pixels on the FPA to be accurately resolved, or else the resulting temperature measurement will be compromised when the camera averages in extraneous background,â he says.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The lower-resolution detector interpolates a greater area between pixels and averages in temperature readings unrelated to the target. In practice, a target thatâs 0.25 square inches can be accurately measured for temperature at a distance of 60 feet with the 320x240 detector, while the 160x120 detector has to be at 30 feet to ensure the same accuracy. (Distances are based on a 25-degree x 19-degree lens). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;âResolution is even more important in infrared imaging than it is in digital photography, and everyone knows how photographers boast about the resolution of their newest digital cameras,â Chynoweth says. "In infrared, resolution affects temperature measurement accuracy, not just image quality. The 320x240 detector, with 76,800 temperature-measuring pixels, resolves an area smaller than a tenth of a square inch at 6 feet, while the 160x120 detector, with just 19,200 pixels, canât image anything smaller than twice that size. With more background averaged into temperature readings, the readings are inherently less accurate. Likewise, the low-resolution thermal image looks like itâs made of tiny little squares, no matter what the viewing size.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
