				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Internet of Things or IoT saw a good growth in year 2016. 2017 will see IoT maturing. Vendors, developers and users will learn to make maximum use of IoT platforms and derive maximum monetary benefit off IoT. There will be no room for failure and those vendors who are unable to adapt and improvise with each emerging IoT trend will perish.

Letâs take a look at our list of top five IoT predictions for this year.

<strong>1) IoT-enabled wearable and devices will become more personalized</strong>

Wearable like smart watches and calorie counters emerged in 2016. In 2017 they will become bigger and better. Consider a situation where you go to your favorite ice cream parlor and open the menu for ordering. But it already knows your flavor preferences and your probable choices. It concocts many dishes for you just by recalling the data stored inside it on the basis of your past experiences. Now you just have to choose the dish from the available options. That is the level of personalization IoT-enabled devices can achieve this year.

<p style="text-align:center;">Img Credit: <a href="https://www.ariasystems.com" target="_blank">ariasystems.com</a></p>

<strong>2) IoT will become more secure and accountable</strong>

With more and more users and user data hosted on the cloud, security and privacy will assume maximum importance this year. Vendors using IoT platform will have to invest lot more into beefing up the security features of their smart apps and do thorough testing before deployment of the app. They may have to offer assurance to users that their personal data, images and records will not be misused by miscreants. For building user confidence, they may have to include data insurance as part of their terms of payment and pay up in case user data is hacked. Ecosystem integrity will be a must for all IoT-enabled apps. According to a report by Gartner, by 2018Â 20 percent of smart buildings will suffer digital vandalismÂ through their HVAC, thermostats and even smart toilets. Hence security and privacy should be the top concern for IoT developers and designers.

<strong>3) Data analytics will become more refined</strong>

The large amount of user data hosted on the cloud needs to be processed and analyzed to reduce the optimum responses by an IoT-enabled device. Just acquiring data will not be enough; high-end data analytics will be required to generate usable reports. Big Data analytics will become bigger and provide abundant opportunities to vendors who wish to gain monetarily off data analytics. Complex data processing models will have to be developed to collate the different types of data being collected by different smart devices.

<strong>4) IoT apps in retail and insurance will give serious competition to traditional vendors</strong>

Traditional vendors in retail and insurance sector will face serious competition from IoT-enabled apps like Amazonâs Alexa. Focus of vendors will shift from product to services owing to the seamless services being offered by IoT-enabled apps. IoT will create major disruptions in these fields and those who will swim against the IoT tide will definitely drown.

<strong>5) Shoppers will become as smart as their smart shopping apps</strong>

IoT will transform the way people shop. They will be able to perform voice-based shopping instead of the  touch-based  apps prevailing today. Instead of navigating through smart screens in shopping apps, shoppers will be able to command the app to present them with shopping options just by using their voice commands. According to Gartner, 2020 will see voice-powered artificial intelligence virtual smart assistants facilitate almost 40 per cent of all mobile transactions. Stores and retail outlet spearheading cutting-edge technology will employ voice-activated smart shopping screens to ensure smooth shopping experience to their customers.

<a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/iot/future-mobile-apps-includes-iot-bots/" target="_blank">IoT was always poised to be big</a> but in 2017 it will become phenomenal. Our IoT can help you get on the IoT bandwagon and make your business more profitable.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[How many times in recent times have you picked up your mobile to make a payment? The trend is moving towards online <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/mobile-apps-helping-financial-sector/">mobile payments</a> through apps. The use of the mobile to make payments is increasing manifold. The data also supports this trend, latest reports suggest that out of the total bill payments made by consumers, approximately 11% are expected to be by mobile in the coming years. 

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apple-pay.jpg" alt="apple pay" width="550" height="310" class="auto_img_wrap" />

<strong>So what causes an increase in mobile payments?</strong>

Demography is responsible for increasing mobile payments from the Asia-Pacific region. It is seen that the high population of these regions along with the deep market penetration of the smart phones in these areas has led to an increase in the payments made through mobiles. More and more people in both the urban as well as the rural areas are now using phones and tablets instead off the usual desktops. This means that for their convenience, they make use of smartphones and apps for making payments. 

This trend is also catching up in the USA and the UK and there has been an increasing number of users who are making payments using the apps. 

Apart from this one also notices that the new generation is more technology savvy than the older generations and therefore know how to utilise technology to the optimum. They have set the trend in using mobile apps for bill payments which has spread even to the older generation who view the convenience and ease of such payments as a boon. 

<strong>What is the USP?</strong>

The USP of the <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/mobile-commerce-solutions/">M-payments</a> is the ease, comfort and convenience with which these can be made. The mobile payments or M-payments are not only used for paying bill but are also used for online money transfers. 
These payments are easy to do and can be carried out anytime, anyplace. So the most important and favourable aspect is that the payments are convenient and easy. 

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mobile-payments.jpg" alt="mobile payments" width="550" height="367" class="auto_img_wrap" />

<strong>The rise of virtual money</strong>

As using the mobile for making payments and transacting in money hs become so easy, there has been a parallel rise in the discovery, implementation and use of virtual money. Be it through mobile wallets or points, virtual money is one of the major modes of payments and is slowly gaining more and more importance. 

The following are the various types of virtual money:

â¢ Bitcoins

â¢ Facebook credits

â¢ Egold

â¢ Merchant loyalty points

The advantages of using this form of money is that it cannot be easily transferred out and also cannot be used without authentication. They have a strong loyalty criteria attached to them which adds to their appeal. The use of these currencies does not require a middleman and hence this has led to this form of gaining popularity with the masses. 

<strong>Use of M-payments</strong>

M-payments are used for the following:

â¢ Making payments

â¢ Purchasing goods and services

â¢ Transfer money

â¢ Pay utility bills

â¢ Collect paychecks

â¢ Take insurance

â¢ Procure loans

â¢ Use mobile wallets

â¢ Guarding against fraud

With the rising use of these M-payments, one area of prime concern is thee security aspect of using the mobile to make payments. The mobile companies are sensitive to this fact and have come up with several ways to safeguard against this threat. The use of biometrics is the most important way to safeguard against any kind of security risk. Some biometric security measures that can be adopted are:

â¢ Fingerprint recognition

â¢ Iris scanning

â¢ Retina scanning

â¢ Facial recognition

â¢ Voice recognition

â¢ Other unique features

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The year 2016 saw upsurge of many app design features such as simplified UI, richer UX, and integration of IoT in mobile apps. All these developments aimed at better usability of mobile apps. The year 2017 promises to offer all this and much more to the users in terms of app design and development.

<strong>1) User interaction will be a series of mini interactions.</strong>

Each user interaction with an app will be broken down into a series of mini interactions giving some reaction from the app. A typical example of user interaction is when a person wants to make a friend on Facebook, he searches the person in question, looks up his profile and then sends an invite to him. In the coming times, the user just taps on the personâs picture or name and a friend invite is sent instantly. Each click, tap or swipe by a user will yield some result in the form of app reaction. In 2017, UX will become richer. 

<strong>2) <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/internet-of-things/" target="_blank">IoT-enabled apps will rule</a>.</strong>

In 2016, IoT-enabled devices emerged for the first time. In 2017, more and more devices will become IoT-enabled. Users wish to remain connected with their devices from far and control them remotely. IoT will be seen in home automation systems, enterprise apps and security systems.

<strong>3) App security will come to the forefront.</strong>

With most apps being based on IOT and large volumes of personal data being hosted on the cloud, breach of privacy and security threats become a looming risk. In 2017, app designers will have to come up with high-end security features for their apps to foster trust among users.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mobile-app-security.jpg" alt="mobile app security" width="550" height="362" class="auto_img_wrap" />

<strong>4) Apps will have a human touch. </strong>

Tamagotchi gestures in app design will give a human feel to apps. More and more product designers are deliberately invoking the Tamagotchi Gesture in their work crafting personality and charm by imbuing their products with a certain incompleteness and fragility. A good example of this is Twitter or Amazon where services are simplified but provide comfort and delight to users precisely because they required such tending.

<strong>5) Apps will have de-linear structures.</strong>

Users will not be herded along like cattle from one screen to the next through an inflexible linear design that some apps have. A typical user interaction with a shopping app consists of some stereotype steps like login to the app, search required items, add them to cart, checkout and rate the app. Now app developers are building more options for navigation through an app, more methods to reach a touch point. 2017 will witness de-linearity of mobile app designs.

<strong>6) Weather apps will be in demand.</strong>

With dramatic climatic shifts all over the globe, weather apps will become need of the hour. Accurate, user-friendly weather apps will find many takers in 2017. People will utilize these apps for accessing weather predictions and planning their activities accordingly.

<strong>7) Googleâs Material Design will come to a close.</strong>

<a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/android/material-designs-new-suite-tools-google-app-designers/" target="_blank">Material Design</a> simplified user engagement with various mobile platforms. Early 2017 will witness a return of skeumorphic elements in the design world beyond the narrow scope of Material Design.

<strong>8) Wearable apps will become popular.</strong>

Appleâs watch and calorie counter are some popular wearable apps and shows next gen of wearable apps capabilities. Users will expect more such wearable devices and apps, especially for fitness purposes.

<strong>9) <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/mobile-user-experience/" target="_blank">User experience</a> will become personalized.</strong>

App layout, navigation and content will become age-responsive in 2017. An instance of this revolutionary concept will be that an app design will be altered automatically when an elderly user accesses it. Font size will increase and color palettes will become muted, navigation will become streamlined and layout will simplify. All this will result in a better user experience.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mobile_User-Experience.jpg" alt="Mobile User Experience" width="550" height="431" class="auto_img_wrap" />

<strong>10) Location-based technology will be exploited to the next level.</strong>

More and more apps will be location-sensitized. We use location-based technology for finding routes to unfamiliar destinations, locating a store or restaurant in a new neighborhood, tracking of an errant child or pet and so on. In 2017, GPS and other location-based technologies will find more use in apps.

2017 will be a year with many ground-breaking advancements in app design, all aimed at satisfying users.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/top-10-mobile-app-trends-in-2017/">Top 10 Mobile App Trends for 2017</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cloud computing or âCloudâ as its commonly called simply refers to storing and accessing your data and programs over the internet instead of your deviceâs internal storage resources or a local server. The cloud does not have a dedicated network attached storage (NAS) hardware or server in residence.

<strong>The <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/backend-architecture-development-mobile-apps/" target="_blank">Cloud as a backend for the enterprise</a></strong>

One of the biggest challenges faced by <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/mobile-application-development/" target="_blank">app developers</a>, standalone or enterprise, is to build apps that can run efficiently on different mobile devices and different platforms. Developing newer versions of your app for different operating systems and different models of the device simply does not make sense given the huge cost and effort it entails. What makes sense is to host all apps and data to a server running on a mobile cloud so that users can access them anytime, anywhere.

<strong>Which is the best Cloud provider for your enterprise: AWS or Azure?</strong>

The cloud computing market is highly competitive. Although in its nascent stage, cloud computing is a major disruption in the IT field and that is what makes it so lucrative for the cloud providers.
Amazonâs AWS is the frontrunner in this market. It has more than 10 times the compute capacity as the combined capacity of its 14 closest rivals including Azure. But this does not spell bad news for Azure. Azure is fast catching up as AWSâs closest competitor with its networking capabilities almost twice as of its nearest rival.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/azure-aws.jpg" alt="aws vs azure" width="700" height="430" class="auto_img_wrap" />


Cloud providers are mainly assessed on the basis of parameters such as compute, storage, network, database and pricing. Let us see how Azure and AWS stand these tests.

<strong>â¶ï¸Â With Respect to Storage</strong>

AWS provides temporary storage that is allocated once an instance is started and is destroyed when the instance terminates. It provides Block storage which is the same as hard disk as it can be attached to any instance or can be kept separate. AWS also offers Object storage with S3 service and archiving services with Glacier. These services are not available in Azure.

<strong>â¶ï¸Â With Respect to Network</strong>

Amazonâs virtual Private Clouds VPC and Azureâs Virtual Network VNet allow users to group Virtual Machines VM into isolated networks in the cloud. Users can specify network topology; create subnets, route tables, private IP address ranges and network gateways. AWS is unique in providing Route 53, a DNS web service.

<strong>â¶ï¸Â With Respect to Compute</strong>

AWS mainly offers EC2 instances which can be customized according to your enterprise. Azureâs offering is centered on its VMs with other tools like cloud services and Resource Manager to help deploy applications on the cloud. Azureâs inter compatibility with Hyper-V has advantages for those running Microsoft VM in their data centre and for those using the Azure Stack private cloud system.

<strong>â¶ï¸Â With Respect to Database</strong>

Azure and AWS support relational and NoSQL database and Big Data through Windows Azure Table and HDInsight.

<strong>â¶ï¸Â With Respect to Pricing</strong>

AWS charges customers by rounding up the number of hours used so the minimum use is of 1 hour. AWS instances can be purchased using one of its 3 models- On demand (Where you pay for your actual use with no upfront cost): Reserved (Where customers reserves instances for 1 or 3 years with an upfront cost based on use)and; Spot(Where customers bid for the extra capacity available on the cloud). Azure charges customers by rounding up the number of minutes used for on demand. It also offers short-term packages with discounts.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure Comparison</strong></p>

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cloud-wars-amazon-aws-vs-microsoft-azure-comparison.png" alt="cloud wars amazon aws vs microsoft azure comparison" width="650" height="569" class="auto_img_wrap" />

Choice of cloud computing providers is entirely the choice of the enterprise. With vendors vying for consumersâ attention, consumers stand to gain with all options.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/technology/cloud-computing-war-amazon-aws-vs-microsoft-azure/">Cloud Computing War: Amazon AWS vs. Microsoft Azure</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the early 90âs the world was hit by a tornado called Internet. It revolutionized the way the world worked. But, people were still wary of its ways and resisted monetary transactions on the net. Companies like Amazon, eBay, Expedia and Netflix changed this scene forever. They grabbed and consolidated a large chunk of business of retail giants and small businesses. Consumers also transitioned from offline to online shopping. That was a time when people used desktop PCs for accessing websites. Then came another technological disruption in the form of mobile apps which put internet in the palms and pockets of people. 

Whether your business is small or large, mobile apps are a great investment which will reap rich dividends in future. Here is a list of reasons why every business needs to invest in <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/mobile-application-development/" target="_blank">mobile app development</a>:

<strong>â¢ Reach out to larger client base</strong>

Think of a grocery store 20 years back. How would the store owner tell everybody about a new product in his shop? A sign board outside his shop? Leaflets or ads in local magazines? Or the traditional way of yelling jingles across the street? How many people would he be able to reach? Compare this to the 4.77 billion people who own mobile devices and who can be reached through a mobile app. It is a no contest situation. No other medium has a larger reach than internet.

<strong>â¢ Enhance your businessâs visibility in the market</strong>

By creating a mobile app for your business, you can curb competition. Chances are that your competitors has not invested in an app. Take advantage of this and race miles ahead in the race.

By imposing your companyâs logo and tag lines on every screen of your app, you create a lasting impression on usersâ mind which lingers on even after they have turned off the app. In this way you add value to your business.

<strong>â¢ Maximize revenue through ads and sponsors in your app</strong>

By placing ads and sponsorship to your app, you can earn from a third party. Apps are a great way to analyze user behavior and offer better service to users based on their app usage history. Better service drives better sales and more revenue.

<strong>â¢ Simplify your business</strong>

Your app can be divided into four main sections- general info or home, search, user account or login and contact details. Through general information, you can tell about the main services and products you offer. Through search, users can find the products they are looking for by filtering all irrelevant information. Through user account or login, you can store user details like interests and preferences. Users can create wish lists, edit and view their shopping carts, cancel and review orders and make payments. An app can make your business simple and customers experience rewarding.

<strong>â¢ Work even when you are not working</strong>

A store cannot remain open all day long but an app can. With an app at hand, you need not attend customers or review sales and inventories. Your app does all this for you even when you are sleeping or holidaying.

<strong>â¢ Connect with your customers anytime anywhere</strong>

Your mobile app will allow you to directly interact with your customers. Adding features like  feedback, like, share and in-app messaging will facilitate great partnership between you and your clients. You may link your app to social platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and allow direct login to your app from these hotspots. 

<a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/mobile-commerce-solutions/" target="_blank">Mobile e-Commerce</a> is here to stay. But the challenges are many. It provides a new way of interaction with customers (swipe and slide versus point and click); new distribution strategies(app discovery versus SEO) and new payment systems in the form of net banking, e- wallets and plastic money. Starting early is better. If you havenât invested in an app yet, do it now. Think of mobile apps as yet another exciting opportunity to provide better solutions for customers and society as a whole.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/every-business-invest-mobile-apps/">Why Every Business Should Invest in Mobile Apps</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The travel app market is exploding with new apps being deployed on a daily basis. With so many mind-boggling choices, a traveler will opt for only those <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/mobile-apps-transforming-travel-tourism-industry/" target="_blank">travel apps</a> which have the <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/essential-tips-engage-app-users/" target="_blank">best user engagement strategies</a>. In simple words, if you want to keep afloat in the flood of travel apps, your app should be capable of building an intimate relationship with its users so that they not only use it again and again but also recommend it to their friends.

<strong>Quick and easy on boarding</strong> is an important requirement of a successful travel app. If the user is not able to get onboard your app quickly on his first attempt, he is likely to get frustrated and discard your app and opt for a competitorâs app. With few clicks on the screen, user should be able to login or register and start making full use of your travel app. This is essential for a good first-time user experience and ensures repeated visits by the same user. Do not overwhelm users with a complicated registration process for your app. Do not try to get them to use all your appâs features at their first visit. Rather take them step-by-step and educate them so that they can optimize their use of your app.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Best-Travel-Apps-That-Guide-You-in-Your-Travels.png" alt="best mobile apps for travel" width="550" height="363" class="auto_img_wrap" />

Obtaining permissions from users for location information and push notifications is also done during the on boarding process. This is an essential step for future engagement of users with your travel app. Convince users to grant permissions for sending them push notifications. Tell them the benefits of doing so. They would get added benefits like latest updates on their flight schedules or privileged information about deals and offers on your app. 

<strong>Accurate analysis of user behavior</strong> is the next step for enhancing user engagement. After users are onboard your travel app, segregate them on the basis of their app usage and behavior. Your app needs to understand its users. By analyzing usersâ browsing history on your app and previous transactions on your app, you will get vital information about his likes and interests. Then your app can send relevant push notifications to them and get more business pout of the. For example, if a user is repeatedly checking out a hotel in your app, you can send an in-app message about a secret discount on that hotel. If you notice, a prospective travelers checking out a destination, your app can send messages and emails about special packages or cheap flights on that destination. There is a good chance users with succumb to your appâs subtle pressure and make their next deal on your app.

<strong>Be a travelerâs guide and companion</strong>. User engagement doesnât end with on boarding a traveler on your app and making a sales pitch to them or even after making a sale on your app. For building a long-lasting relationship with your users, itâs advisable to provide them helpful service while they are travelling. Messages like tell your check-in time at your hotel, we will keep your room ready for you; hope you know your boarding gate has changed last minute; do you need a pickup from your hotel to the closet attraction; we noticed you browsing for arts and artifacts. Here are the places to get the best bargain for these things- all will keep your travel app connected with its users during the trip and make sure your users will remember you even after the trip is over. 

<strong>User ratings of your app and feedback on your app</strong> are other great ways to build user engagement on your travel app. Now that your app has been a great friend and companion to its users, do not forget to tell your users to rate your app and submit these ratings. A good user ranking is essential for app store rankings and future business.

Some travel apps with commendable user engagement tips and tricks are Tripit, CityMapper, Duolingo, Splittr and LiveTrekker. If you donât want your travel app do be just one in a crowd of many, build an effective user engagement technique and you have a winner in your hands!<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/build-user-engagement-travel-apps/">How to Build User Engagement in Travel Mobile Apps</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mobile application market is evolving and growing rapidly. New apps and software are cropping up on a daily basis and only those will survive which have no room for error. As customersâ expectations are higher than ever and patience shorter than ever, testing automation has become more important than ever. 
In the past year we witnessed many interesting trends in software testing. Let us take a look at the top five trends which impacted testing automation.

<strong>â¢ Continuous and comprehensive testing even during development stage</strong>

Software developers and testers have finally realized the importance of early testing of their software. With Agile and DevOps methodologies of software development and deployment, test automation testers have become an integral part of the Agile team developing the app. Like software development, software testing has also become iterative and progressive. As delivery cycles become shorter, testing tools have become more developer-friendly. Now testing tools will need to increase their focus on integration with IDEs for continuous delivery.

<strong>â¢ Increasing adoption of open source</strong>

<a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/top-tools-automation-testing-mobile-applications/" target="_blank">Test automation tools and frameworks</a> have turned towards open source for lowering cost, increasing efficiency and improving quality. There was an increased investment in open source triggered by Appleâs initiative to make Swift, the next version of its language, an open source. It was quickly followed by Microsoft which did the same for its .Net platform. Open source tools like Selenium and Soap UI continue to grow. In 2017, we expect to see more and more commercial vendors embracing open source.

<strong>â¢ <a href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/technology/take-advantage-devops-mobile-apps-testing/" target="_blank">DevOps drive quality testing</a></strong>

DevOps are based on seamless integration between different departments of an IT organization- developers, quality professionals and IT professionals. Here testing plays a crucial role in business decisions as now testing is not only involved in verifying correctness of the code, but in overall aspects of engineering. This will allow greater speed of deployment, quality assurance and thus, higher return on investment in a shorter span of time. Quality engineering will become more mainstream because of DevOps.

<strong>â¢ Mobile Testing becomes more prominent</strong>

With more mobile devices in the world than the worldâs total population, it has become imperative to develop techniques for mobile testing of software. They are tested for functionality, performance and security. Cloud computing now communicates with apps through ERP systems. So, data security has become paramount. Multiple OS platforms hosting apps make mobile testing necessary but also challenging. Now there is need for functionality testing and integration testing. According to the World Quality Report, 55% of organizations now test mobile apps, up from 31% last year. Yet, 56% lack effective testing procedures.Â 

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mobile-test-automation.jpg" alt="mobile-test-automation" width="550" height="423" class="auto_img_wrap" />

<strong>â¢ Security testing has become essential</strong>

As more and more data and systems become interconnected through cloud computing and Internet of Things, security of data has become paramount. What stresses the need of IoT testing is the fact that all these devices on internet are making them susceptible to hackers. According to a HP study, 70 percent of devices in the Internet of Things are vulnerable to security problems.Demand for IoT-enabled devices is rising exponentially as so is the need for testing apps and software for data security. Another emerging trend is that IoT-enabled testing will become big in next few years. More and more vendors will opt for IoT testing of their products. This will require highly sophisticated testing tools with analytical abilities.

The introduction of new architectures such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), increase in virtualization and inclination towards cloud has shaken up the industry and has compelled testers to consider new aspects. Considering the above trends, predictions, and statistics, we see a brighter future of test automation in 2016 and beyond.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/mobile-applications/5-developing-trends-impacting-testing-automation/">5 Developing Trends Impacting Testing Automation</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Technology has changed the way humans interact with machines and even how machines interact with other machines. After the shift from desktop websites to mobile apps, now comes a time when mobile apps are also undergoing a transformation. IoT and Bots are instrumental in bringing about this paradigm shift.

Let us see how:

<strong>How mobile apps are integrated with Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>

IoT is a network of internet-enabled devices all having an IP address and communicating with each other through a mobile app on a Smartphone interface. The best example of integration of mobile apps with IoT is in home automation systems in what we call âSmart Homesâ. Here all major systems in a house like security, lighting, heating, air conditioning and even cooking devices are intelligent which means, they are programmed to receive instructions from the users in the house and behave accordingly. How does all this happen? Actually all appliances involved in these systems are interconnected through cloud-based technology to a main hub which can be controlled through an app on the usersâ Smartphones, tablets or wearables like Smartwatches. Mobile connectivity and in-built sensors in devices strengthen the IoT ecosystem creating a new world of opportunities.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/home-automation-iot.jpg" alt="home automation iot" width="550" height="376" class="auto_img_wrap" />

In an IoT-enabled environment, our mobile devices will act as the main interface through which we can interact with our IoT-enabled devices. One of the reasons why IoT is fast becoming a mainstream technology is that our mobile devices come fully-loaded with features like geo-location based technology and multiple connectivity options like WiFi, Bluetooth and NFC. These qualities in our mobile devices qualify them to be at the core of the IoT ecosystem. 

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/philips-iot-device.jpg" alt="philips iot device" width="550" height="332" class="auto_img_wrap" />

Let us see one more example of the awesomeness of IoT-enabled mobile apps. Earlier when a guest wanted to enter a hotel room, he needed a key or an access card. With IoT-enabled Smartphones, a guest can just open the hotelâs app on his Smartphone, select the relevant options and proceed into the room as if he owns it. Amazing isnât it?

IoT in India is still in its nascent stage. Many app developers are in a wait-and-see mode to understand the real scope of IoT on app development. Slowly but steadily app developers are embracing the IoT trend. According to a survey by Developer Media, there has been a 24% increase in the number of app developers working on IoT apps in 2015 compared to 2014. Going by these numbers, IoT seems to be the future of mobile apps.

<strong>How Bots are the future of Mobile Apps?</strong>

â¢ Bots are said to be the next big thing. Experts feel Bots may even replace mobile apps. Here are the reasons why:

â¢ Bots are very easy to install. For installing a Bot, simply search for it from within your favourite messaging app and click on it to start chatting. No need to download or install the app from a play store.

<img src="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chatbots.jpg" alt="chatbots for mobile" width="550" height="433" class="auto_img_wrap" />

â¢ Bots are easy to distribute. Just like you can install a bot from messaging apps, you can even share your favourite bot from messaging app itself. Bots can even be linked to your social media account. A great example is Slack, a bot which when installed by one team member, gets automatically added to other members so that all can use it.

â¢Â Bots are cheaper than mobile apps. High-quality mobile apps are costly to develop, maintain and deploy. As bots are deployed on a messaging app, you can leverage the fact that the messaging app was developed by someone else who bore its cost. New feature are deployed with continuous integration to the backend alone.

â¢Â Messaging apps are already ubiquitous. They have penetrated the market at all levels. Almost everyone uses 1 or more messaging app on a regular basis. Since this is the base of Bots deployment, you can be sure that they will also infiltrate the market in similar fashion.

â¢Â Bots are portable, convenient and extremely user-friendly. Besides messaging apps, bots can be installed as a live chat, personal assistant like Echo or Siri, car audio system. Smart watches, email and push notifications.

IoT and Bots are indeed the future of mobile apps. We have seen enough evidence of that we shall be witness to more in times to come.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/iot/future-mobile-apps-includes-iot-bots/">Why Future of Mobile Apps Includes IoT and Bots</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techaheadcorp.com">TechAhead</a>.</p>
