    <description>&lt;p&gt;Google achieves one of the long-standing âgrand challengesâ of AI by building a computer that can beat expert players at the board game Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google has taken a brilliant and unexpected step toward building an AI with more humanlike intuition, developing a computer capable of beating even expert human players at the fiendishly complicated board game Go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Cybersecurity: The Age of the Megabreach</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545616/cybersecurity-the-age-of-the-megabreach/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;We havenât stopped huge breaches. The focus now is on resilience, with smarter ways to detect attacks and faster ways to respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In November 2014, an especially chilling cyberattack shook the corporate worldâsomething that went far beyond garden-variety theft of credit card numbers from a big-box store. Hackers, having explored the internal servers of Sony Pictures Entertainment, captured internal financial reports, top executivesâ embarrassing e-mails, private employee health data, and even unreleased movies and scripts and dumped them on the open Web. The offenders were said by U.S. law enforcement to be working at the behest of the North Korean regime, offended by a farcical movie the company had made in which a TV producer is caught up in a scheme to kill the countryâs dictator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Will Machines Eliminate Us?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/546301/will-machines-eliminate-us/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;People who worry that weâre on course to invent dangerously intelligent machines are misunderstanding the state of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoshua Bengio leads one of the worldâs preÃ«minent research groups developing a powerful AI technique known as deep learning. The startling capabilities that deep learning has given computers in recent years, from human-level voice recognition and image classification to basic conversational skills, have prompted warnings about the progress AI is making toward matching, or perhaps surpassing, human intelligence. Prominent figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have even cautioned that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity. Musk and others are investing millions of dollars in researching the potential dangers of AI, as well as possible solutions. But the direst statements sound overblown to many of the people who are actually developing the technology. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, put things in perspective in an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;âs senior editor for AI and robotics, Will Knight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Immune System Offers Major Clue to Schizophrenia</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546136/immune-system-offers-major-clue-to-schizophrenia/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A massive genetic study has sketched out a molecular link between schizophrenia and how the brain is shaped in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning a rare insight into the cause of schizophrenia and possible ways to treat it, scientists in Boston say they have identified a biochemical pathway that contributes to the disease by altering connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Can We Insure the Internet of Things Against Cyber Risk?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545736/can-we-insure-the-internet-of-things-against-cyber-risk/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Software with security flaws, and a lack of historical data on risks, have made the Internet of things tough to insure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insuring the security of connected products is hard for a simple reason: they are too new, and too little is known about the economic losses or personal injury they might cause. What the industry needs is data, and analytics to translate statistics on losses into policy standards and consistent pricing. Only then can emerging industries like self-driving cars and network-connected medical devices really take off, says software security expert Josh Corman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Why Weâre So Vulnerable</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545621/why-were-so-vulnerable/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An expert in U.S. national cybersecurity research and policy says the next generation of technology must have security built in from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an age of continuing electronic breaches and rising geopolitical tensions over cyber-espionage, the White House is working on a national cybersecurity strategy thatâs expected in early 2016. Helping to draft that strategy is Greg Shannon. He was until recently chief scientist at Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Software Engineering Institute and is now on leave to serve as assistant director for cybersecurity strategy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Next Big Test for AI: Making Sense of the World</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545906/next-big-test-for-ai-making-sense-of-the-world/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A new database will gauge progress in artificial intelligence, as computers try to grasp whatâs going on in scenes shown in photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a breakthrough in machine learning suddenly enabled computers to recognize objects shown in photographs with unprecedentedâalmost spookyâaccuracy. The question now is whether machines can make another leap, by learning to make sense of whatâs actually going on in such images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;They spin in their cages and donât interact. The scientists who created autistic monkeys say theyâll now try to cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in China say they used genetic engineering to create monkeys with a version of autism, an achievement that could make it easier to test treatments but that raises thorny practical and ethical questions over how useful such animal models will be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>A Peek Inside a Dead Football Playerâs Brain</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545651/a-peek-inside-a-dead-football-players-brain/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The brains that come through Ann McKeeâs lab donât lie. But they are only the beginning of the story about head trauma and its role in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain on the table once belonged to a pro football player. Itâs also much bigger than average, so it may have been the brain of a very big manâperhaps he played lineman. Those are the only things I know about it before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/alzresearch/about-us/team/faculty/mckee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ann McKee&lt;/a&gt; starts cutting it into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft Research study uses augmented reality to project a life-size person into a room with you, perched in an empty seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats talking to another person face-to-face, but a group of researchers are considering whether a life-size projection of a person who appears to be sitting across from you in an actual chair might be a close second.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Big Auto Searches for Meaning Beyond Selling Cars</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545646/big-auto-searches-for-meaning-beyond-selling-cars/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Car companies from Ford to BMW take a page from Silicon Valleyâs playbook to offer transportation services, in some cases without a real business model in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ford Motor Company unveiled its new Fusion sedan and powerful F-150 Raptor pickup truck last week at the 2016 Detroit auto show. But shiny new sheet metal and roaring engines were upstaged by the companyâs unveiling of a suite of so-called âmobility services.â Those offerings include the shared use and ownership of cars, parking reservations, multimodal routing, small retail stores, and an iTunes-like app to provide access to these services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Using Patient Fingerprints to Break Down Medical Record Silos</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545566/using-patient-fingerprints-to-break-down-medical-record-silos/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A startup uses encryption and fingerprint authentication to compare medical records across providersâand aims to make them easier to move, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the over 40 million people served by the more than 300 health systems working with startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://crosschx.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;0&quot;&gt;CrossChx&lt;/a&gt;, checking in for a doctorâs appointment is much like unlocking an iPhone. All you need is your right index finger. Touch it onto a fingerprint reader at the check-in desk, and your identity is verified. Your driverâs license can stay in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Ideal Fuel</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/demo/544586/the-ideal-fuel/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A nanomaterials chemist has figured out a good way to mimic leaves and turn water and carbon dioxide into things we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a sunny day on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, the peaceful rustling of eucalyptus trees belies the furious chemical activity happening inside every single leaf. Through photosynthesis, leaves use the energy in sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into substances that plants need, emitting only oxygen in the process. In a nearby lab, chemist Peidong Yang is building an artificial system that does the same, using arrays of nanowires coupled with engineered bacteria. If something like this is ever scaled up, it would churn out a better version of the fuels we use todayâone that does not add to the total amount of carbon dioxide in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The disorder known as trisomy 21 is untreatable. Or is it? Some families think an antidepressant could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Southwest Airlines pilot Paul Watson lands in a new city, he often strikes out to visit the labs of local scientists studying Down syndrome. He likes to stay current because his 14-year-old son, Nathan, has the condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A wearable device promises to help steady hand tremors by using an old technologyâgyroscopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was a 24-year-old medical student living in London, Faii Ong was assigned to care for a 103-year-old patient who suffered from Parkinsonâs, the progressive neurological condition that affects a personâs ease of movement. After watching her struggle to eat a bowl of soup, Ong asked another nurse what more could be done to help the woman. âThereâs nothing,â he was grimly told.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Dubious Promise of Bioenergy Plus Carbon Capture</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544736/the-dubious-promise-of-bioenergy-plus-carbon-capture/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change agreements rest on negative emissions technologies that may be unachievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many scientists and climate change activists hailed Decemberâs Paris agreement as a historic step forward for international efforts to limit global warming, the landmark accord rests on a highly dubious assumption: to achieve the goal of limiting the rise in global average temperature to less than 2 Â°C (much less the more ambitious goal of 1.5 Â°C), we donât just need to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to essentially zero by the end of this century. We also must remove from the atmosphere huge amounts of carbon dioxide that have already been emitted (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544551/paris-climate-agreement-rests-on-shaky-technological-foundations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;âParis Climate Agreement Rests on Shaky Technological Foundationsâ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
