    <title>How DARPA Took On the Twitter Bot Menace with One Hand Behind Its Back </title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/546256/how-darpa-took-on-the-twitter-bot-menace-with-one-hand-behind-its-back/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When DARPA ran a competition to find Twitter bots designed to influence online debates, it inspired a new generation of anti-bot strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more disturbing phenomena on Twitter is the proliferation of bots that generate tweets automatically in an attempt to spread spam, to make money illicitly through click fraud, and, most worryingly, to influence the discussion on topics such as terrorism and politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>How One Intelligent Machine Learned to Recognize Human Emotions</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/545986/how-one-intelligent-machine-learned-to-recognize-human-emotions/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nobody knew how to identify peopleâs emotional states by looking at their brain waves. Then a machine learning algorithm stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to communication, humans are hugely sensitive to each otherâs emotional states. Indeed, most people expect their emotional state to be taken into account by their correspondents. And when this happens, communication tends to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>How an AI Algorithm Learned to Write Political Speeches</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/545606/how-an-ai-algorithm-learned-to-write-political-speeches/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Political speeches are often written for politicians by trusted aides and confidantes. Could an AI algorithm do as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âAsk not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.â&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;âJohn F. Kennedy, 1961&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title> How Future Cars Will Predict Your Driving Maneuvers Before You Make Them</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/545506/how-future-cars-will-predict-your-driving-maneuvers-before-you-make-them/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Prototype car safety systems are learning to watch the driver, as well as the road ahead, to predict future maneuvers more than three seconds before a driver makes them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a new car these days and the chances are that it will be fitted with an array of driver-assistance technologies. These can match the speed of a car ahead, manage lane changing safely, and even apply the brakes to help prevent a collision. So an interesting question is how much better these safety systems can become before the inevitable occurs and the car takes over completely. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Best of 2015: Data Mining Reveals the Extent of Chinaâs Ghost Cities</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/544821/best-of-2015-data-mining-reveals-the-extent-of-chinas-ghost-cities/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Overdevelopment in China has created urban regions known as ghost cities that are more or less uninhabited. Nobody knew how bad the problem was until Baidu used its Big Data Lab to find out. From November â¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent years, China has undergone a period of urban growth that is unprecedented in human history. The number of square kilometers devoted to urban living grew from 8,800 in 1984 to 41,000 in 2010. And that was just the start. China used more concrete between 2011 and 2013 than the U.S. used in the entire 20th century&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Best of 2015: The Truth About Smartphone Apps That Secretly Connect to User Tracking and Ad Sites</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/544801/best-of-2015-the-truth-about-smartphone-apps-that-secretly-connect-to-user-tracking-and/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have developed an automated system for detecting Android apps that secretly connect to ad sites and user tracking sites. From May  â¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are essentially two starkly different environments in which to download apps. The first is Appleâs app store, which carefully vets apps before allowing only those deemed fit to appear. The second is the Google Play store, which is more open because Google exercises a lighter touch in vetting apps, only excluding those that are obviously malicious.Â &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Best of 2015: Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/544781/best-of-2015-why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars are already cruising the streets. but before they can become widespread, carmakers must solve an impossible ethical dilemma of algorithmic morality. From October â¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to automotive technology, self-driving cars are all the rage. Standard features on many ordinary cars include intelligent cruise control, parallel parking programs, and even automatic overtakingâfeatures that allow you to sit back, albeit a little uneasily, and let a computer do the driving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>AI Machine Learns to Drive Using Crowdteaching</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/544926/ai-machine-learns-to-drive-using-crowdteaching/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Some driving tasks are trivial for humans but hard for machines. Now researchers have developed a way for AI machines to learn from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the year of the AI machine, and itâs been a rapid change. Artificial intelligence has suddenly begun to match and even outperform humans in tasks where weâve have always held the upper handâface recognition, object recognition, language understanding and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>What Google and Facebook Can Do to Fight ISIS</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/544401/what-google-and-facebook-can-do-to-fight-isis/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook intervenes to prevent suicide. How about to prevent radicalization? And letâs face it: Google and others make it easy to find videos of people being murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hillary Clinton called on tech companies to help âdisruptâ ISIS, major players like Facebook were quick to point out that they forbid terror-related content on their sites. Thatâs true. But thereâs more they can do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Machine-Vision Algorithm for Analyzing Childrenâs Drawings</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/view/543676/the-machine-vision-algorithm-for-analyzing-childrens-drawings/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Psychologists believe that drawing is an important part of childrenâs cognitive development. So an objective analysis of these drawings could provide an important insight into this process, a task that machine vision is ideally suited to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studying the psychology of children and the way it changes as they develop is a difficult business. One idea is that drawing plays a crucial role in childrenâs cognitive development, so drawings ought to provide a window into these changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A rapid increase in our knowledge of alien worlds has dramatically changed the way scientists are interpreting the famous Drake equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Drake equation describes &lt;em&gt;â&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nâ:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which radio communication might be possible. Its author, the astronomer Frank Drake, originally penned it as a discussion point for one of the first meetings about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the early 1960s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
