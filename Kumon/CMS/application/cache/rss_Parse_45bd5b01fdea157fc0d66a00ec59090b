        <title type="text">How to Manage and Benefit from Change</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Great organizations are always changing. I don&amp;#39;t mean change for the sake of change, but planned, structured, progressive change that enables organizations to grow, evolve, survive and thrive in any type of marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When discussing change, many questions arise, such as: &amp;quot;How can you leverage and manage change?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How can you become a change agent who is constantly and proactively preparing for change?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How can you create a culture where you are able to make change work to your advantage rather than allowing it to destroy you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The better question is, &amp;quot;Why change?&amp;quot; The answer is reflected in the statements below, adapted from Joseph Rost&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Leadership for the Twenty-First Century&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	I had occasion to go to the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office recently. It was for a basic checkup, and since I am a lean guy to my bones, I want to focus on the visit from my perspective &amp;mdash; the customer. My appointment was for 10 a.m., and I arrived there promptly at about five minutes until 10. I signed the sign-in sheet, found a magazine and started reading. At about 10:25 (25 minutes after my appointment time), I was called back to the examination area, where the nurse told me to go in and wait. I then sat in the smaller waiting room for about 15 more minutes before the nurse came in to examine me. This was not the real exam; this was merely a preliminary exam. She took my weight and blood pressure and asked me if I had been feeling sick or otherwise had any concerns. This process of her visit with me took her about five minutes. So on the time scale, I had been in the office for 45 minutes and had human interaction for about five of those minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="text">How to Gain a Competitive Advantage in a Tough Economy</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	With the current economic environment, there is always the tendency to hunker down and try to ride the storm out, but is that the best strategy? Probably not. While there is most certainly a need to watch budgets closely &amp;mdash; even very closely &amp;mdash; and tighten up on extra activity, now is the time to take advantage of developing your current employees to help improve your operation and, in fact, all business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A growing number of companies have been actively implementing and even working to accelerate training within industry (TWI) into their everyday business practices and operations. The program is designed to enable improvements every day by everyone, create a more functional relationship between employees and their supervisor (which is translated into solving issues before they become a problem), and getting workers properly trained in record time. To summarize: Save money, leverage and enhance tribal knowledge, and make the entire business enterprise more compe</summary>

	In today&amp;rsquo;s environment of reliability excellence, integrated maintenance/operations teams, new technologies and constant pressure to make maintenance more effective and elevate it to a prominent value-added position, the maintenance manager must become a business unit manager with equal footing with other plant functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance managers operate a business within a business. They have 24-hour/seven-days-a-week responsibility, a product to deliver, customers, resource allocations, planning, people development responsibilities, political acumen, accountability and drive. They also have the highest-trained workforce with a lot of untapped talent and creativity. What should this professional manager have in his backpack?&lt;/p&gt;

	For the last 10 years of my career at the United States Postal Service, I sponsored a maintenance leadership mentoring program that was designed to improve and expand the abilities of our managers to meet the demands of today and tomorrow. We stri</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	In many of the articles and books that are published today, you see a great amount of improvements in different industries and companies using different methodologies and tools. Many times, it seems that if you use the same tools or methods, you should get the same results. This is not always the case. There is an underlying story to a company that excels in making improvements, and that is the culture. I like to think of the culture as the foundation to effective operation. Culture includes leadership, initiative, teamwork and all of the other nice words we love to throw out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Webster&amp;rsquo;s defines culture as &amp;ldquo;All the knowledge and values shared by a society.&amp;rdquo; I think the interesting part of this definition is the word &amp;ldquo;shared.&amp;rdquo; Have you ever been in an environment where everyone seems anxious to pitch in and volunteer to help others accomplish projects? In these instances, everyone has a shared sense of purpose. Each one of them probably knows how importa</summary>

	I have never been known to be musically inclined, but I can recognize a great song when I hear one. One of these great songs is &amp;ldquo;I Heard It through the Grapevine.&amp;rdquo; This particular song has been recorded and re-recorded numerous times over the years by many different artists, and although it may bring thoughts of animated raisins to people in my generation, it is more closely associated with Marvin Gaye.&lt;/p&gt;

	You can be forgiven if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize Arnold Vosloo&amp;rsquo;s name. In fact, you have to be a bit of a movie buff to have a chance at this one &amp;ndash; and by movie buff, I mean you don&amp;rsquo;t leave the theater until the credits display key grip or you know what C.S.A. stands for. For the non-buffs, Vosloo is the actor who played the character &amp;ldquo;Imhotep&amp;rdquo; in the 1999 movie &amp;ldquo;The Mummy&amp;rdquo; (i.e., he played the mummy). In the category of &amp;ldquo;Best Portrayal of a Resurrected Supporting Actor or Actress&amp;rdquo; (not yet a category, but under consideration), Vosloo is an Oscar shoe-in. He is also a brilliant change agent.&lt;/p&gt;

	When it comes to problem-solving activities in plants and how to go about them, the typical engineering-oriented approach tends to be very rigorous and detailed, with the objective of getting to the absolute correct technical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this level of rigor seems perhaps commendable, the question to ask is, &amp;ldquo;What is the value of taking extended time to rigorously solve a single issue if the majority of the attendees don&amp;rsquo;t see any way that they can apply such a process to the frequent issues they must deal with?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rigorous approach is great when you&amp;rsquo;re working with left-brain-dominant engineers, but it is not for everyone. Of course, to be realistic, there are many problems that need a very rigorous process. However, what we&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to do in the majority of these plant exercises is:&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is important to every manufacturing operation. Successful reliability requires communication, cooperation and coordination. To learn the importance of these three Cs, let&amp;rsquo;s examine how your organization is structured and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much does unscheduled downtime cost and where does the responsibility for that unscheduled downtime lie? Is the unscheduled downtime because someone unilaterally decided to run to failure, or is it because the work request was in the &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; but not responded to in a timely fashion to preclude the unscheduled downtime caused by an unscheduled failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a competent operator know when there is an anomaly with the equipment? Since a good operator is a living, breathing data-acquisition machine, the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; In the state of normal operation, good operators are cognizant of anomalies in the equipment they operate approximately one-fourth of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="text">How Learning Can Change Behavior, Produce Results</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Many people are familiar with A3 analysis as a management process &amp;ndash; a methodology for thinking, planning, problem-solving and then starting all over again. In this process, you begin by defining the problem, describing the current conditions, and defining goals and targets (what&amp;rsquo;s the desired outcome?). Next, you analyze what has caused the gap between current conditions and the desired outcome, and you design a countermeasure to help you reach the future state. Then, the A3 process calls for planning who will do what, plus a follow-up step to capture what has happened, what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what issues remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many elements of this A3 analysis apply to planning for and implementing effective learning strategies. There&amp;rsquo;s a big gap when it comes to workplace learning &amp;ndash; the gap between what often constitutes training and the desired outcome of improved performance. If you invest in learning and nothing changes, has learning taken place?&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	If your company was manufacturing automobiles, appliances, iPads or even cardboard boxes, you certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think about scheduling production without a complete and accurate bill of materials (BOM) for each finished product so you could determine your raw material requirements from a master schedule. So why is it that many process industries not only begin operation without equipment BOMs, but go for years &amp;ndash; sometimes decades &amp;ndash; without them?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When we ask people to assess the quality of their equipment BOMs, the comments we get most often are: &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t exist,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We have some of the data, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s accurate.&amp;rdquo; When we ask why that&amp;rsquo;s the case, the response is usually: &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have the information,&amp;rdquo; or more likely, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to do all that work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;

	In &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&amp;rdquo; the white rabbit is eternally behind schedule and skittishly hyperactive. What is easily overlooked is his firm grasp of the subtle intricacies of effective change management. For example, he off-handedly advises Alice, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something, stand there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although this statement initially appears counterintuitive &amp;ndash; after all, much of formal change management is getting individuals to actually do things differently &amp;ndash; the change will only be effective when the right people do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oftentimes during change, so much emphasis is placed on end results that we take shortcuts on the way those end results are achieved. For instance, during a recent engagement, a client was implementing a new process for the operators to follow. To meet the expectation of a speedy implementation, the area manager intended to provide the process training to the operators. On the surface, that might not sound like a</summary>

	In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive global environment, we are constantly being asked to do more with less. Now more than ever, companies are asking their employees to become more productive, more efficient and more &amp;ldquo;lean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Strategic planning, value stream mapping, reliability engineering, loss elimination &amp;ndash; these phrases have become popular from the boardroom to the shop floor. But where does their value really lie? How do we make decisions that uncover value, eliminate loss and allow for proper strategic planning for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answer lies not in the decisions we make but in the data we use to make those decisions. Good, strong data is key to making good, strong decisions. We are all familiar with the axiom of &amp;ldquo;garbage in, garbage out.&amp;rdquo; So what kind of data should we use? What metrics give us the best snapshot of our current levels of performance?&lt;/p&gt;

	Early in his change-management career, Yogi Berra was advising a professional sports organization in New York on some of the finer points of managing change. At the executive briefing, Berra delivered his change-management theory overview, which he summed up in this single statement: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;ve got to be very careful if you don&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;re going, because you might end up someplace else.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

	Apparently, the executive board was impressed because they extended his engagement an additional 14 years. Although his actual change consulting career was short lived, Berra did highlight one of the most critical aspects of successful change &amp;ndash; knowing where you&amp;rsquo;re going. In organizational change, where you&amp;rsquo;re going is usually summed up in business terms: lower cost, higher quality, greater customer satisfaction, etc. These objectives, however, are the results of specific, repeated behaviors.

        <title type="text">Why Execution is Key for Business Strategies</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Business strategies developed by companies are often useless. A business strategy is basically a plan for what the company should focus on in the future. It is a promise and guideline to steer a company in the right direction. It&amp;rsquo;s not too different from your personal New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions include things such as losing weight, exercising more, drinking less and improving their marriage in some form. The universal formula for change in any personal-improvement book or business book is to:&lt;/p&gt;

		Understand how to do it&lt;/li&gt;

		Execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us compare a business strategy with our beloved New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. We know what the problem is, right? We are fat, unhappy, stressed, whatever. We usually know how to improve (drink less, exercise, spend time with the wife), but we fail to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

	Will Rogers was one of the most revered public figures in the early 1900s, and much of his popularity was due to his tremendous understanding of and connection with people. As a keen student of human nature, Rogers unsurprisingly identified a fundamental key to successful change in his statement: &amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t what we don&amp;rsquo;t know that gives us trouble; it&amp;rsquo;s what we know that ain&amp;rsquo;t so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many changes have been hampered by individuals who rigidly hold onto the current state because of something they &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that ain&amp;rsquo;t so? For example, when U.S. auto manufacturers first observed lean production, they refused to believe their own eyes. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t build cars that way &amp;mdash; not enough inventory.&amp;rdquo; They struggled to understand a world that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit into their view of reality even when faced with clear evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

	Considered by many as the father of modern political science, Niccolo Machiavelli wrote &amp;ldquo;The Prince&amp;rdquo; as practical, if not morally ambiguous, advice on what is necessary for a new prince to establish stable rule &amp;mdash; in other words, how to create and sustain major change. The following excerpt from his book demonstrates Machiavelli&amp;rsquo;s awareness of the difficulty of change and the resistance it can provoke.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	With the forming of ISO Technical Committee 251, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that asset management will soon have a standard. Now is the time to educate ourselves about the value that optimized asset management creates. Based on the release of ISO 9001, Quality Management Systems &amp;ndash; Requirements, there is a valid expectation of hype, confusion and a large outpouring of funds as companies work to achieve compliance. Luckily, like quality management, asset management is about identifying, mitigating and eliminating risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Formalizing, documenting and validating our asset management plan seem like a significant undertaking. Since the planning committee is using BSI PAS 55 as a starting place, it is likely that the core of the specification will remain valid. Part 2 of this specification provides the guidelines for application and also includes seven items that can be reviewed by an organization to see how they compare to the key 28 elements of part 1.

	The only true competitive advantage a company has is its employees&amp;rsquo; ability to learn, grow and change so they can discover, improve, innovate and meet the challenges of a dynamic marketplace. Today&amp;rsquo;s agile companies know that learning and continuous improvement is a priority. &lt;em&gt;Training Magazine&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; 2009 industry report published that the average organization spent approximately $484,000 on training-based investments per year.&lt;br /&gt;

	Formal instruction, online or in the classroom, is critical to developing talent in your organization. However, formal training is a piece of the learning process. Learning professionals largely agree that 80 percent of learning happens outside of a formal classroom. Some learning leaders think that the amount of informal learning (unstructured learning that happens outside the traditional learning events) drives the percentage even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Findings from recent catastrophic events, such as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, have revealed that information relating to asset health was readily available but not properly managed. Analysis of the Gulf of Mexico event indicated that there were conditions in critical assets that could have impaired performance prior to and after the accident. A routine testing and maintenance program should have detected these conditions. This is an easy statement to make after a catastrophic event occurs. What is much more difficult is to navigate the overwhelming number of specifications and standards available to corporations on management systems and develop an asset management model that provides the transparency to asset health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step is developing a management system standard that adequately addresses six key elements:&lt;/p&gt;

	On May 11, 1996, 34 people attempted to summit Mount Everest. In what came to be the deadliest single day on Mount Everest, eight people lost their lives. Numerous factors led to the tragedy &amp;ndash; most notably a late-day storm that trapped many on the peak. One of the climbers, a journalist by the name of Jon Krakauer, captured his experience that day in his book &amp;ldquo;Into Thin Air&amp;rdquo; and in it identified another more subtle, but just as significant factor in the tragedy. Krakauer was one of the first climbers to reach the summit on that day, and during the descent he became increasingly concerned about the other climbers&amp;rsquo; singular focus on reaching the summit. The basis for his concern was his knowledge that reaching the summit was only half the challenge. The descent from the peak is as difficult and exhausting as the ascent. By focusing so much effort on reaching the summit, the climbers risked not reserving both time and energy to make the demanding descent. When the storm h</summary>

        <title type="text">Fed report: U.S. industrial production increased 0.8 percent in December</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial production in the United States increased 0.8 percent in December after having risen 0.3 percent in November, the Federal Reserve announced on January 14.&amp;nbsp;The rate of change for industrial production was revised down in November but revised up in September and October; the net effect of the revisions from July to November left the level of industrial production in November slightly higher than was previously reported. For the fourth quarter as a whole, industrial production increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, a slower pace than in the earlier quarters of the year. In the manufacturing sector, output moved up 0.4 percent in December with gains in both durables and nondurables. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory output increased 0.5 percent. The output of mines advanced 0.4 percent; the output of utilities surged 4.3 percent, as unusually cold weather boosted the demand for heating. At 94.9 percent of its 2007 average, total industrial production in December was 5.9 percent above its level of a year earlier. The capacity utilization rate for total industry rose to 76.0 percent, a rate 4.6 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite recent economic reports that show jobless claims down for several consecutive weeks, employees reveal mixed feelings about what is in store at their employer, for the overall job market and their pay check in the year ahead. According to the Q4 Glassdoor.com Employment Confidence Survey of 2,118 U.S. adults aged 18+ conducted on its behalf by Harris Interactive, employees are more confident in their job security and company&amp;#39;s outlook in the next six months than they were in the third quarter. However, this optimism is not universal as employees remain pessimistic about pay raises and have grown more uncertain about the job market since last quarter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Tom Peters first captured the attention of global business leaders with his 1982 book, &amp;quot;In Search of Excellence.&amp;quot; By examining the characteristics shared by successful companies, he created a guide for managers keen to drive their organizations to greater heights.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A series of subsequent books served to hone Peters&amp;#39; thinking and provided the launching pad for his successful consulting company. He now spends much of his time traveling the world, advising senior managers on the steps they need to take to ensure their company&amp;#39;s long-term survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to Peters, future economic success will spring from entrepreneurial individuals and small firms agile enough to seize new opportunities. Freed from the constraints of top-heavy management structures, they will generate the ideas and innovations needed to survive in an ultra-competitive world.&lt;/p&gt;

Considering inflation, firms continued to pass on sharply rising input costs to clients through increased output charges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="text">Japanese manufacturing output, new business and employment fell in December</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	December data pointed to another deterioration in Japanese manufacturing sector operating conditions, although the rate of contraction eased to the weakest in three months. This primarily reflected slower declines in output, total new business and employment. On the prices front, input cost inflation quickened to the fastest since May. However, output prices continued to fall amid strong competition for new work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title type="text">Russian manufacturing output, new orders rose at faster rates in December</title>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	HSBC survey data signaled that Russian manufacturers ended 2010 on a positive note, as output and new business both increased at their strongest rates since August. The seasonally adjusted HSBC Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), a composite index designed to track overall business conditions, posted its largest one-month gain since September 2009 in the final month of 2010, rising from 51.1 to 53.5 in December. The latest figure signaled the strongest overall improvement in operating conditions since March 2008, and was greater than the PMI&amp;rsquo;s long-run average of 52.1.&lt;/p&gt;
