            <title>Improve Maintenance with Detailed Planning</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/0019444e-ebca-4f1d-baf2-479013dd6355_planning.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A well-planned job not only can greatly reduce the time the work takes, but it also ensures a quality job and makes the work much more satisfying for the tradespeople who complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planning is the process of receiving a problem, deciding on a solution and issuing instructions so that anyone can complete the work exactly as the planner intended. Planning is completely independent of scheduling and is a different process. Adding a job to a list of work to be done on a shutdown or next week is not planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All work is planned by someone at some time, but for the best results, the planning process should be separated from the execution of the work to ensure it is well-organized before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The five steps in detailed planning are: deciding on the appropriate solution; listing all the steps required to complete the work; listing all the materials, tools, equipment and information required and where each is located; estimating the time for each step and for the whole job; and attaching any sketches, drawings, photos, instruction manuals and standards required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The detailed work planning process is best illustrated with an example. In the following example, the job is a &amp;quot;redesign&amp;quot; (not maintenance) and will be carried out by one tradesperson. The work is for a mining company and involves installing a fume hood in a small laboratory at a field office about a 40-minute drive from the central workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This example is very detailed, which is appropriate for a remote job where missing materials or tools could result in a long and expensive delay. For work that is close to a central shop, less detail is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few assumptions were made in preparing the example, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The single tradesperson who will be assigned can do all the work without any restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The department is well-organized with accurate records.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is a shop van stocked with many commonly used supplies and tools, and the inventory is checked frequently so tradespeople can be confident that the parts and tools that are supposed to be in the van will be there when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is a list of standard tools that each tradesperson must keep in his or her personal toolkit and take to each job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A &amp;quot;work order kit&amp;quot; process is in place so materials from stores and direct purchases are staged in an appropriate place, identified by the work order number and managed by the store&amp;#39;s staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now review the plan below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Work Order Form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/de7fd0c6-dae1-480e-a529-61fec0ebba08_Capture-a1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 453px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the detailed work order form with all information including scheduling details, etc. Note the comments that answer the anticipated questions, such as the reason for the job, the absence of asbestos and the capacity of the electrical circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Sketch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sketch can be helpful to understand the job scope, although perhaps unnecessary in this example because the planner has marked the locations of the new electrical outlet and the new fume hood on the lab walls with masking tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Job Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/5ddb5d7a-af21-4e46-b3ad-4bab449936b7_Capture-b1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 514px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the start of the process of &amp;quot;thinking through&amp;quot; the job and is often best done onsite. Each step is small enough so a tradesperson or planner can easily think of each required tool and material. Note that all steps in the job, including preparation, transport and clean-up, are listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Job Step Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/40905a0d-1ca6-455b-a40e-2df02607723d_Capture-c1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 466px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/a3d73a48-4378-406a-842d-d97181b31c66_Capture-d1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 367px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the planner can enter important instructions against each of the steps listed above, including safety tips, equipment protection, assembly instructions, etc. At this point, an estimate for the time each step will take can be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Material and Tool List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/481b31d6-0e16-4c51-8673-5cf6ff92d0b8_Capture-e1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 486px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/3a24c722-6c03-4f83-88d2-5b8943e430d5_Capture-f1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 489px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/20/fb84a598-076e-411f-8ce2-3469e001cac9_Capture-g1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 479px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All materials and tools should be included except for small tools that are a part of each personal toolkit. A job can be stopped for the lack of a fastener just as it would be for the lack of a large component. By concentrating on only one small step at a time, it is unlikely that an experienced planner or tradesperson will overlook any items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a good maintenance computer system, this list of materials and tools can be filtered to show only those items in the work order kit or those that will come from the tool crib. This simplifies the process of gathering all materials before the job begins and helps avoid overlooking any item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If more than one person or team is assigned to a job, there may be &amp;quot;parallel&amp;quot; activities that could be used to build a critical path network. For example, if two people were assigned to the fume hood installation, one could install the ductwork while the other installed the electrical outlet. No matter how many people are assigned, each step in the job should be planned in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To some, this plan may seem overly detailed. However, on a reasonably complex job like this with several steps, it is easy to miss an important item, even for those who are familiar with the work. Remember, every step, tool and material listed on the plan must be decided and acted on at some time by someone, whether the work is planned or not. In this example, any need to return to the shop or stores will result in a delay of approximately 90 minutes and will force the job into the next day with yet another 90 minutes of travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experienced planner should be able to complete the work order package in this example in less than an hour, excluding the time taken to visit the site. Of course, if the planner is not sure of the best way to address any part of the work, it will be essential to get input from others, such as tradespeople with the appropriate experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is a good practice to assign this kind of detailed planning to tradespeople, even if the people who prepare the plan will do the work themselves. Much of the detail, such as listing the tools and supplies required, need only be handwritten and attached to the work order hard copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a job like this, a fully detailed plan could easily reduce the time to complete the work by 50 percent or more, compared to an unplanned approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Detailed plans should be prepared for all shutdown work in continuous operations and for work that will take place remotely. For all other work, the same principle of &amp;quot;thinking through&amp;quot; the job should be employed, but the level of detail can be reduced and more of the planning function can be delegated when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The level of detail required in a work plan depends on several factors, including the distance from the shop to the work site, the importance of finishing the job on time, the skill and experience of the tradespeople who will do the work, the availability of appropriate standards and the scope of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the scope of work is uncertain, careful thought should be given to all the possibilities that may be uncovered as the work progresses. It may be prudent to include some additional tools and materials in the work plan even if it is unlikely they will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is clear from this example that for a planner to work efficiently, the supporting systems must also be efficient. The most important of these are the stores cataloging and staging processes, the purchasing process, and the technical equipment and standards information systems. The discipline in managing the tools and supplies that are outside of the stores&amp;#39; control is also important. The scope of any project to improve planning will often include improvements to these supporting processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/HluBcgRaTSA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Increase Asset Reliability through Effective Planning and Scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/25/55f43bf7-bfb5-4e4e-adfe-216b7cbfccf1_scheduling.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 273px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Maintenance operations present certain challenges. Unexpected repairs, efficient management of technician time and keeping up with preventive maintenance are just a few major areas that maintenance managers must address. However, these challenges can be met through effective planning and scheduling and by using technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Focus on the Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planning and scheduling are two of the basics or fundamentals of maintenance management. If you do not have appropriate basics in place, no amount of technology can help. Once you determine the appropriate process flow and planning requirements for your maintenance operation, technology such as a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) can help you tremendously. The trick is to make sure that your CMMS supports your process flow and planning and scheduling model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning and Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases, maintenance technicians find themselves &amp;ldquo;fighting fires&amp;rdquo; that come in the form of urgent work orders. Without effective planning and scheduling, time is wasted because priorities are not set and needed parts are not available. When technicians are sent to complete work orders without proper planning and scheduling, they are frustrated by miscues, wasted time (looking for parts, unnecessary travel, etc.), and incomplete repairs. The requesters get frustrated when the job is delayed and they don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planning is essentially reviewing jobs before they are dispatched to technicians in order to determine the necessary parts and tools and if they available, the level of skill set and time required, if a permit or special equipment is needed, if outside contractors are required, and if there are drawings or sketches to attach to the work order. Once the job is planned, it then must be scheduled. Part of scheduling is assigning an individual to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many people think developing a planning and scheduling system for a maintenance department is a complicated task. However, it is similar to the process of starting a home-improvement project. You think through the steps, choose materials and then schedule the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance supervisor often believes more technicians are necessary. However, in most cases, it is inefficient work flow that leads to low labor productivity. Think of it this way: If you have a crew size of 50 technicians and you improve the productivity by 20 percent, you just hired 10 new technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Managing Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A planning and scheduling system is not complete without establishing effective parts management. To ensure parts are available when work orders come in, the following steps must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add a parts list to each piece of equipment. Technicians will not waste time looking up part numbers and corresponding vendors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Instruct technicians to record substitute parts when discovered. This information can save another technician significant time later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review frequently used parts and delete obsolete items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Receiving and Prioritizing Work Orders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders are the key to successful planning and scheduling. Smooth maintenance department operation relies on how work orders arrive and how they are handled. In many maintenance operations, new work orders arrive by phone. With a large number of work orders per month, significant staff time is devoted to answering calls. In addition, it is easy for details to be lost when orders are delivered verbally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increasing the number of work orders arriving electronically instead of by phone can save time and reduce frustration. Electronically submitted work orders minimize communication problems because the requester&amp;rsquo;s exact words are recorded for easy reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An objective classification system is necessary to schedule work orders appropriately. A prioritization model should be used to code certain tasks as &amp;ldquo;urgent,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;could be completed at a later date.&amp;rdquo; It is important to limit the priority ratings to a few categories. Too many priority ratings are not practical. This system can be adapted to fit the needs of different operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Role of the Planner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A planner serves as a central gatekeeper, making decisions regarding work orders. The planner&amp;rsquo;s tasks include making scheduling decisions based on preliminary investigations, grouping work orders for one building or location, confirming the availability of parts for the job, determining the availability of work areas and/or equipment, limiting interruptions to technicians&amp;rsquo; work by assigning urgent requests only to dedicated or pre-assigned technicians, ordering parts, reviewing and revising preventive maintenance procedures, and participating in continuous improvement of work orders and the planning and scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Stay on Task with Preventive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An effective planning and scheduling process pays just as much attention to ensuring preventive maintenance is completed on schedule as it does to urgent work orders. To maintain regular preventive maintenance, the maintenance operation can predetermine the amount of time needed and the parts that are necessary to complete the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Benefits of Planning and Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance planning and scheduling prioritizes and organizes work so that it can be executed in a highly efficient fashion. Asset longevity is improved and compliance requirements can be met because preventive maintenance is completed on time. Another benefit is that planners can assign jobs based on the technician&amp;rsquo;s location. This is especially helpful at a large operation where it may take a technician 20 or 30 minutes to report back to the maintenance department in order to receive the next assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most operations stay in a reactive mode and do not see a high level of productivity. Once planning and scheduling is implemented in conjunction with the effective use of technology, your operation can begin to operate in a proactive mode, increasing efficiency, lowering maintenance costs, reducing emergencies, and improving asset reliability, thereby boosting productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/2DrJOe0vWyQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Can All Maintenance Work Be Planned?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/4/c4f0cd02-bf11-4884-b948-e94dc0ddc6fc_maintenance-work.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 314px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A job that is well-planned will ensure that the intended scope is achieved, the quality is high and that time and effort are not wasted. On average, a well-planned job will take about half as long as a job that is not planned. This article looks at the function of planning in more detail and suggests some ways to ensure that all maintenance work, except genuine emergencies, is properly planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the definition of planning is deciding what to do and how to do it, then by definition, every maintenance job that is done is planned by someone. Where a position with the title &amp;quot;planner&amp;quot; exists, it is often assumed that the incumbent spends his or her day planning work. In reality, planners spend much of their time processing work orders, which is not planning, and completing other administrative tasks, such as scheduling. They actually may spend little time performing detailed planning. For the majority of work, the decisions on what to do and how to do it are left to the maintenance supervisor and, more often, the tradespeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The common process for handling smaller maintenance tasks, which often accounts for the majority of the maintenance effort, is to assign tradespeople to work that has not been well-defined. The scope of the work assignment then includes &amp;quot;planning&amp;quot; (i.e., identifying the problem, deciding on a workable solution, and finding tools and materials) and executing the repair. Work of this nature is difficult to estimate and schedule because the scope is unknown. If the planning function is left to the tradespeople on a job-by-job basis, it is most unlikely to be an efficient use of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ideally, all work should be planned in advance, especially work that has a tight deadline, such as shutdown work, and work that is isolated from the source of supplies and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the work management process, a decision should be made on the assignment of the planning function for each new job. If new work orders are reviewed daily by the maintenance and operations supervisors (a good practice), then this is an ideal time to decide if each job should be planned by a planner or by tradespeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the planning function is assigned to tradespeople, then it should be properly managed. Examples of good management include allowing time during PM inspection tours to plan the repair of problems that are found. A supply of simple forms for recording the work steps and the materials and tools required for each step should be included in the work order package for PM inspection tours. The PM work order should also specify the time allowed for this planning activity. Of course, this will work only if the PM administration process is designed to allow inspectors to quickly check to see if problems identified during their inspection already have a repair work order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another example of good management would include scheduling the planning of work by tradespeople as a part of their regular activities while following proper scheduling practices. For instance, if there is a high-priority job to be planned or executed in a remote location, then other lower priority work at that location should also be planned at the same time whenever practical. Work orders for these planning assignments can be readily estimated and need not be charged to the equipment. This planning effort will also allow a realistic estimate to be applied to the resulting repair work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, never allow any restrictive trade practices to interfere with planning. If a pipefitting trade exists and pipefitters have jurisdiction over pipe repairs, this should not prevent a PM inspector from another trade from listing the job steps and materials (bolts, gaskets, ladders, etc.) to replace a leaking gasket. Contractual restrictions should only apply to the physical repair work. In conservative organizations, this may be a highly contentious point, but it is worth resolving for everyone&amp;#39;s benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the planning function is assigned to tradespeople, its scope should be made clear. Typically, tradespeople will identify the job steps as well as the materials, tools and equipment required, while another non-trades position such as a planner and/or storeroom employee will have the responsibility to gather those items into a suitable work order kit prior to the work being scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Detailed planning, which is the process of thinking through a job, breaking it down into logical steps and listing all the materials, tools, equipment and labor required to do the work, does not come naturally to many people. However, it can be learned and will improve with practice. It is a skill that can be used for many activities in life, both on and off the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/xTPq7Wn6BCI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Implement Effective Maintenance Planning and Scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/23/6ae8d845-c4fa-4e48-a394-8ea9abd9ec36_planning.jpeg" style="width: 285px; height: 295px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Many organizations have implemented planning and scheduling into their maintenance operations to improve the utilization of their personnel, reduce unplanned downtime and more effectively manage their maintenance budgets. Every company experiences obstacles, roadblocks and resistance along the way, and some are more successful than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept of planning and scheduling maintenance activities is not a novel idea. In fact, this process has been around for years. In some form, all maintenance work is planned and scheduled. But who does the planning and scheduling, when does it take place and is the resultant work executed in the most effective, efficient and cost-conscious way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article will cover the journey one company took to incorporate effective planning and scheduling into its maintenance organization. The company, which has multiple factories in the upper Midwest, realized that it needed to address the way it managed its maintenance activities in order to remain competitive in a global marketplace. Work was not tracked accurately, spare parts were not associated with equipment, labor and material costs were not tracked to the assets, and budgets were overrun on most outages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;#39;s initial approach was to conduct an assessment of its current maintenance management processes, identify the major gaps and develop an action plan to tackle those gaps. The assessment took place in 1999 and ranked the company 437 out of 1,000, which was just out of the &amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;rdquo; scale. The corporate maintenance manager took the assessment information and recommendations into account to formulate his action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Challenges Encountered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Buy-in to implement the maintenance manager&amp;#39;s plan was not easy to obtain, both at the corporate and factory management level. There was resistance in changing the way maintenance had been managed for many years. Another challenge involved getting all the factories aligned. Every factory had its own ways of performing maintenance activities, and in order to measure the progress of this initiative, each would be required to follow the same template. These challenges all warranted training on what best practice should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance manager arranged a visit to an aluminum smelter in South Carolina that had been identified as one of the nation&amp;#39;s best. Delegates from the company made the visit and observed the smelter&amp;#39;s maintenance practices as well as the roles, responsibilities and duties of its planners. After seeing how the planner/scheduler worked at the smelter, the company created a planner position at each of its factories. The planners were selected from the maintenance workforce by seniority. It became evident early on that one planner was not adequate to support the maintenance efforts of the factories. Additional planner positions were posted at each location. Rather than basing the selection of individuals solely on seniority, additional criteria were established to obtain the best individuals for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training was provided to the new candidates, and aptitude evaluations were administered. Candidates were also presented with maintenance scenarios to develop corrective action job plans. These would be used to evaluate their ability to plan all aspects of a job. The results were well-qualified individuals promoted into the planning positions. Each factory hired two to three planners, depending on the factory size and maintenance workforce. Planning and scheduling was now up and running at each factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were few successes in the beginning. The culture change in each factory was still ongoing. The factories expected the planning efforts to be perfect right from the start. The expectation was that the planners knew everything about each system and piece of equipment and would provide explicit details, when in reality they were still figuring out what to do. Leadership didn&amp;#39;t always buy into building or following a schedule. Schedule compliance was low. Estimating efficiency was poor, with little effort in accurately charging time to the correct work order. Work orders were also scheduled without all parts and materials on hand. Needless to say, there was frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, each factory started establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to begin trending the progress. Some early measurements included the total number of work orders, the number of orders with no planned costs, the number of orders on the weekly schedule and the number of unscheduled orders. The discipline to capture this information weekly helped to set the expectation for all departments that they needed to contribute to make the transition a success. Key metrics were put in place and reported to demonstrate the trend of what maintenance was able to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Early accomplishments in planned work, schedule compliance and downtime continued to improve over the years through better planning and scheduling. Between 2006 and 2009, the organization&amp;#39;s percentage of planned work improved from 83 to 85 percent, schedule compliance jumped from 29 to 63 percent, and downtime decreased from 4 to 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Between 2009 and 2013, the company experienced some major changes, including the attrition of a large portion of its workforce. A majority of the seasoned planners/schedulers left, and new employees moved into those positions. As a result, the gains the company made in the years up to 2009 were impacted, and momentum was lost. However, since 2013, the momentum has been renewed, and progress is again being made. After a significant drop, planned work is back up to 76 percent, schedule compliance is at 68 percent, and downtime is 1.18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Path Going Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the company initially classified its efforts as managing maintenance, it has since formalized the endeavor into what it calls &amp;ldquo;operational excellence.&amp;rdquo; This initiative was built on a partnership between operations and maintenance for the common goal of the company. All personnel have been trained on what operational excellence means along with the roles and responsibilities of every individual within maintenance and operations. As personnel changes are made due to reassignments, attrition and retirement, new employees are coached on the concepts. The company is not complacent with what has been accomplished through planning and scheduling, but realizes that it must continue to improve in all aspects of management and productivity to remain ahead of the competition. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/cTW1QzqTYhw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>2 Ways to Improve Work Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my visits to job sites around the world, I often find opportunities (weak links) in work execution processes. The two that are most prevalent are the work feedback loop and the maintenance planner/scheduler closing and archiving completed work orders to history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The work feedback loop is shown below. The planner/scheduler plans and schedules work. Once the work has been executed, the feedback mechanism closes the loop by providing the planner/scheduler with information from completed planned jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ideally, the completed work order should include information required to update the job plan. These items consist of additional or corrected task steps, safety information, parts and materials, and job duration information. The planner/scheduler then reviews and updates the job plan for the next time the work is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/7/1/749c89d6-c9c9-44af-b0d8-2dfde1e200cc_Capture-4.jpeg" style="width: 559px; height: 363px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the case of closing and archiving completed work orders, the planner/scheduler is the guardian of the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)/enterprise asset management (EAM) data. To that end, in addition to using the information from the completed work order to update the job plan, the planner/scheduler must make sure that the work performed description is comprehensive and accurate. Obviously, &amp;quot;it was fixed&amp;quot; is a poor work performed description. This is what the planner/scheduler must guard against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the planner/scheduler should be ensuring that the right equipment asset was properly identified, correct failure codes were used and so on. This represents the last chance to get the data right before it is archived in the CMMS/EAM. Performing this task correctly ensures accurate data for mining bad actors and other reliability engineering reporting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Together, these represent two simple yet, often overlooked opportunities to tie up loose ends and strengthen your maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Develop a Plan to Reach Continuous Improvement Goals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/9/6/f10c6a0b-9e80-4bab-a7e7-67d887226a7a_plan-do-check-act.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;In the ever-changing world of continuous improvement, we must always remember to walk our own walk. If we, as continuous improvement leaders, are teaching and coaching people in the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) process, we too must ensure that we are leading by example. We must not vary our process from this cycle of improvement that works so very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many companies get so focused on the DCA part of the equation that planning is completely left out or is at best an afterthought. We do, check, act, do, check, act over and over again so many times that we are working really hard in several different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, I challenge you to be very deliberate in your planning process. Since I am focused on continuous improvement, I am writing this note from that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What exactly do you want to accomplish through the application of continuous improvement? While that is a pretty broad subject, consider each of the following topics: quality, cost, delivery, safety, morale and growth. Thinking as specific as you can, lay out quantifiable goals for each of these topics so that the organization has a clear signpost to follow, as well as a quantifiable progress report for the fiscal year you are confronting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of this is clear if you go through an enterprise-level value stream map. If that is not the model you follow, at least spend time with the continuous improvement process to define where you are trying to take the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have determined your high-level goals for each of these topics, then you can set out with the tactical plan for how to accomplish those goals using Pareto analysis, value stream maps and other tools. The point is to define where you want to go before you embark on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As someone once told me, &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t know where you are trying to go, the best map in the world won&amp;#39;t help you much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/B3GYBMq3ClU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Minimize Waste with a Smooth Work Flow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common performance metrics is planned vs. unplanned work orders. The benchmark goal has been 90 percent planned (preventive maintenance and other planned activities) and 10 percent unplanned corrective/breakdown maintenance. In reality, with most organizations the ratio is anywhere from 10 to 30 percent planned maintenance to 90 to 70 percent unplanned. This is indicative of operating in a reactive mode, which contributes to waste, reduced equipment life and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A thorough understanding and analysis of a maintenance work process flow makes it easier to identify and eliminate waste. The goal is not only to eliminate waste but to develop an improved work process flow that is more effective and productive. As the flow is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed, the entire process flow becomes visible and wasteful activities such as delays, unnecessary travel and the like are easily identified.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some ways to minimize wasteful activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Trending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring usually involves the use of installed devices (gauges, meters, etc.) to monitor the operating conditions of equipment and other assets. An example is pressure and temperature readings on a boiler. Maintenance can establish operating limits for the condition(s) being monitored and trend the observed data. If the observed data is outside of a certain predefined range of values, some maintenance action may be required. This is referred to as condition-based maintenance. It can be very effective and less expensive than periodic or fixed frequency maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning and Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planner/scheduler&amp;rsquo;s role is very important in a lean maintenance environment. The goal is to optimize utilization of available resources. Detailed job plans should be developed for all approved open work orders including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number and type of labor resources (how many plumbers, carpenters, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time estimates so required manpower can be determined&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detailed job steps including permit/safety requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Parts and tool requirements (pre-kit if possible)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clear job instructions, drawings, sketches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job site walk down to determine the most efficient way of doing the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment availability coordination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Outside contractor requirements (if any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Delays must be avoided at all cost. Weekly scheduling must be done with daily fine tuning as necessary. This level of detail and coordination is required to achieve a lean and efficient maintenance operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Expert Tips for Planning a CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A well-planned and executed computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) project can yield a maximum return on your investment. This return is realized through increased efficiency, productivity and profits. However, a poorly planned and executed CMMS project can result in a loss of revenue. These losses can be measured in terms of the overall investment in the project, as well as from wasted time and lost projected revenue forecast tied to the successful installation and implementation of a CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Properly planning the CMMS implementation project is one of the key elements. In the planning phase, you determine the &amp;ldquo;what,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;why,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developing a plan for equipment data is a good first step because it will provide a CMMS with a foundation of hard, verifiable data. Some maintenance departments may already employ an equipment numbering scheme that is effective. This can easily be translated into the CMMS. If there is no scheme currently in place or if the current one is flawed, it is time to develop an equipment numbering scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determining an equipment hierarchy is the next step. This involves setting up parent/child relationships among equipment. For example, an air handler can have pumps and motors as children. If you are going to keep track of both the parent and children, the relationship must be documented. Make sure to include every piece of equipment that falls under that hierarchy scheme. Parent/child relationships also can be constructed for whole facilities. For instance, a building could be the parent with each floor a child. Each room could then be a child of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information on spare parts should be tagged to the individual pieces of equipment. This is referred to as the bill of material (BOM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, you need to decide what you want from your CMMS in terms of downtime monitoring. You should choose which pieces of equipment you want to monitor as well as how you want to track planned vs. unplanned downtime. Plan based on impact or loss of operation. You should have this information for each piece of equipment or at least for critical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Preventive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following decisions have to be made for each preventive maintenance (PM) task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM be performed by calendar time or run time (miles, hours, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM follow a fixed schedule (regardless of completion date) or a schedule based on completion date?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often will PM work orders be generated (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the strategies for route-based PMs? (For example, an inspection route for all fire extinguishers in a building.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Procedures can be preventive maintenance, safety instructions or any other set of instructions. Each piece of equipment should have identified for it all the preventive, corrective and predictive maintenance tasks necessary to properly maintain that equipment. Along with the maintenance task, information regarding maintenance frequency, responsible craft, repair and/or consumable parts necessary to compete the maintenance task, and time estimated to compete the task are some of the additional information that will enhance the usefulness of your CMMS database. These procedures can then be applied anywhere within the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need information on each maintenance technician such as name, address, phone, Social Security number, etc. You also have to decide if you are going to use some sort of ID card for your technicians that can be scanned by a reader. If you do, will the cards be produced in-house or by an outside vendor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following actions must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, you have to develop a part-numbering scheme. This is similar to the process used for equipment numbering. Some companies use a 20- to 30-character-long part-numbering scheme. It includes every detail of that part (i.e., type of part, thickness, diameter, location, etc.). With advances in CMMS and a field available for each of these details (category, dimensions, location, etc.), you don&amp;rsquo;t need a part-numbering scheme to include all of the details. It just increases the potential for data-entry errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implicit in the development of a part-numbering scheme is the need to concretely define the details of parts. The most useful in terms of work flow is defining the location of a part. Is there one or multiple stockrooms? Is there a location scheme within the stockroom (i.e., aisle, bins, shelves, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the data-gathering phase, you will compile a list of all the vendors from which you buy parts and services. One of them should be assigned as a primary vendor for each part. The CMMS automatically generates purchase orders to the primary vendors. This can be changed by the users if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this stage, you have to decide the criteria for selecting a primary vendor (i.e., price, delivery, overall service, etc.). Additionally, you should track vendor/manufacturer part numbers for cross-referencing purposes. You also need to decide the issue units that you are going to use (metric, British or a combination of both). How are you going to handle inventory of pipes, beams, etc.? Are you going to keep track of lengths? If a piece is cut, are you going to keep track of the remaining pipe length? Once vendor and tracking information is decided upon, you also need to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who has the authority to order parts and up to what amount?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Beyond what amount will further approval be required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the overall planning of the physical inventory process, you must make the following decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often are you going to take the physical inventory?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who is going to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is it going to be manual or using mobile technology? If it is manual, make sure your CMMS has the capability to print the appropriate forms for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Associated with this step is development of a parts label design and barcode label design. What information do you want to print on the parts labels? Part number, description and location are typical. If you are using barcoding with inventory, you have to decide which information items you want barcoded. Part number and location are typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have multiple plants/facilities, it is important that every facility follows the same schemes. Without consistency, the CMMS will not be very effective. If you are looking for a part at a different facility and that facility describes the part differently than you do, you may not find it even if it is in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Purchasing and Accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You likely will need the purchasing and accounting departments involved in the planning phase for these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Bill to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Ship to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales tax rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine budget accounts and amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should determine what plan and design codes will be used throughout the CMMS. During the planning phase, you need to decide on strategies for the basis of codes. Actual compilation of codes will be done during the data-gathering phase. Determine the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Account codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order type&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Action codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order priority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment criticality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purchase order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are employing mobile applications, you need to identify each application and work on articulating the details. Some examples include using a hand-held remote data-entry device to collect equipment meter readings, parts can be issued and/or returned using a hand-held device, hand-held devices can be used to count and track inventory parts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Decisions also need to be made regarding data backup. An articulated backup scheme should be formed that takes into account both hardware and setup. Determine how often backup will be done (daily, weekly, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan for the type of maintenance history you want to maintain. Your decisions should include date performed, task performed, the person(s) who performed the job, estimated and actual time to perform, equipment performed on, material used, and any outside contractor cost incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several decisions need to be made regarding the general operation of your CMMS. These questions provide information not only for planning but also for evaluating current capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are you going to print estimated time on work orders?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What details of reports are needed in your CMMS?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Which reports are needed in graphics format?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What decisions will be made based on reports analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Security issues: Who is permitted to do what?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field legends: Do you need to change the terms provided by your CMMS on any of the legends? If yes, be sure to document the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop a list of KPIs for your application. At this stage, you should review them and revise, if necessary. Also, determine how you would compute those KPIs. Most of the KPIs should come from CMMS reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assign Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan on who will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Install the hardware (if necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the computer hardware, backups, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform archiving and merging of data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take care of disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Generate reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review and analyze various reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan and schedule work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do the ongoing data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be responsible for customizing, configuring, tailoring and maintaining the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning stage of a CMMS is perhaps one of the most important in ensuring success. Granted, implementation itself is not a short process, but with a well-laid-out plan where all possibilities are considered, the process will be simpler and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The major challenge in planning a CMMS is considering the entire breadth of your operation down to every last piece of equipment, part and facility, and then remaining realistic with your goals. Consider the abilities of your operation to adapt to a new technology in a manner that will not unduly disrupt workflow. With a laid-out plan, you will reap the rewards for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/jZOu2G5HsJE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ensure Planning and Scheduling Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do you initially train someone new to the planner/scheduler position? First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the selection process, as I see this as an issue in many organizations. Ideally, the planner/scheduler should be one of your best craftspeople. You have to compensate the position at a level at least equal to your first-level supervision. The compensation should include accounting for the average overtime earned as a craftsperson if you expect them to apply for the position. You will not get many applicants if you are asking them to accept a significant reduction in their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to being a highly skilled craftsperson, the candidate should have good computer skills, a positive attitude, people-oriented and be self-motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you have identified the right person, the obvious next step is to get that person trained. You generally have a couple of choices here. You can send them off to a class, or you can host an on-site course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to another question. How do you help guarantee success with planning and scheduling? Realize that you can send a planner/scheduler off to training, have them return and, despite their best efforts, the organization will not allow them to plan and schedule work. Providing the on-site course will allow you to educate supervisors, team leaders, managers, engineering personnel, production supervisors, production planners and anyone else who interacts with the maintenance work management process. Now everyone can understand not only the roles and responsibilities of the planner/scheduler, but also their own roles and responsibilities in relationship to the work management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I teach maintenance planning and scheduling classes, I want to share a number of approaches. There are a several methods and opinions on how to plan and schedule work. What I find is that some groups actually do a disservice to their course participants by not sharing a comprehensive approach with various methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the initial training is complete, recognize that you are only one-third to halfway done. After about one to two months, it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring in a coach. Ideally, the coach is an external resource who walks a mile beside the new planner/scheduler. The purpose of this is to observe the activities of the planner/scheduler and also the interactions within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I coach and mentor, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to determine if the planner/scheduler is applying the items learned in the class. Are they creating job plans? Is the continuous improvement loop in place? Is the planner/scheduler focused on the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to see how the supervisors are interacting. Do they understand their roles and the planner&amp;rsquo;s roles? Are work orders being completed and data entered into the CMMS? Is the organization aligned for proactive scheduling? These are just a few of the items that I address in my coaching sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of coaching sessions depends on the organization. It may only be one to two in total. Now, about retraining, a number of organizations bring me back on a semi-annual to annual basis to provide an overall best practices health check as a good method to determine if the organization is continuing to mature in its implementation efforts. If it has gone stagnant, I&amp;rsquo;ll point out the obstacles and help get them back on the road to success. Ultimately, this is my primary goal. I have a passion for maintenance and operations, so I really care about people being successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not an external resource, someone internally needs to remove the obstacles to ensure effective planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With respect to retraining, you should always be in a state of constant learning. That means reading articles and attending events that foster learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a two-day maintenance management course in California&amp;rsquo;s wine country, I met a planner/scheduler who attended the course the previous year. At the end of the course, I asked him why he chose to re-attend so soon afterward. He mentioned that he had forgotten a number of items, and the main one was creating job plans. Wow! Besides scheduling the work, this is one of the most important parts of planning and scheduling. This example highlights the need for retraining, especially if you opted not to provide coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/uwGGjHxfRmU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Start a Reliability Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/584987f6-8c68-4688-bcfc-2ac8706122a8_start-reliability-program-3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 253px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;Where do I start? I have heard this question many times, and there is no easy answer other than &amp;ldquo;pick a spot.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that normally when a company decides to start a reliability program, there are a lot of improvements to be made in other areas as well. I have never heard of a facility in which everything is perfect and the only thing they need to do is start a reliability program to become world class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is tied to almost every other area in a facility, and so when one area is at a low point, other areas are also suffering. I would call on all of the experienced reliability veterans to offer their suggestions to help those who want to start a reliability program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gather all of your best people, including the top people in production, maintenance, quality and safety/environmental. This group should have various levels of technicians, operators and management. The group should figure out the areas that need improvement. I do not only mean specific pieces of equipment, but all of the areas that affect reliability, such as training, scheduling, parts and tools. The list can go on, but the point is that you need to have a picture of the potential improvement to get some direction. The list of improvement areas needs to be prioritized so everyone can get on the same track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick the Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you know what needs to be improved, you can decide on the tools you need to start working. Sometimes the tools are already in the toolbox, which is great. If the tools are not in the toolbox, it is time to buy them. When purchasing tools, you want to buy the quality ones and not the bargain-bin tools that will fail to live up to the task. Some of the tools include root-cause failure analysis (RCFA), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), fault-tree analysis (FTA), life-cycle cost analysis, etc. The tools are not all related directly to reliability either. Your different areas &amp;mdash; planning/scheduling, quality, custodial services, etc. &amp;mdash; can have a profound effect on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Champion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The champion must be a person who is committed to the job and the future goals. Far too often, this hat is given to a person who already has a few hats, and it ends up getting shelved at times. That can impede progress in moving a reliability program forward. The champion also needs to have the power and ability to make changes happen and influence the decision-making process. Responsibility without the ability is a recipe for failure. The champion is normally a cost in the beginning, but over time will pay for itself over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many more things you can do to start a reliability program, but this is a great way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/7_GZ81tbmPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Waste to Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems as if new weight-loss programs and products come out every week. One of the latest is a plastic wrap you place around your stomach. If you strap it around your stomach, you will sweat and lose weight. Brilliant! Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably sweat if you wrap anything air-tight around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the more interesting thought is to wonder why we fall for this stuff over and over when we all know the basic concepts in weight loss, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less energy intake will reduce fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More exercise will burn fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More muscle mass will increase metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you know and understand these basic principles of weight loss, you can apply them and become very successful in losing weight. You will learn that it takes hard work to improve your metabolism and that it is a long-term lifestyle commitment, not a short-term project. This sounds awfully similar to reliability improvements, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Perhaps that is because both topics are maintenance, just with different equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is one of the newer concepts or buzzwords around maintenance. The lean philosophy encourages us to look at waste. What is waste in maintenance? Typically (not always), the largest waste is environmental and safety issues, followed by downtime of production equipment. There are also other losses such as damage due to catastrophic failures, wasted labor due to poor management system, high cost of parts and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key in the lean philosophy is to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we reduce waste?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that we improve equipment reliability. As we all know, the key elements to improve equipment reliability are to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning and scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spare parts management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technical database&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Root-cause analysis practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering and design with consideration to reliability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills development on all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept &amp;ldquo;lean maintenance&amp;rdquo; and all other new reliability improvement concepts often provide interesting angles and viewpoints, but you will end up with the same answers. To be quite honest, there are new technologies, but not much new has happened with work practices lately. The list above has been true since 1972. The hard part is doing the things in the list, not coming up with the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is just another word used to convey doing the basics, but the angle is different. I recommend reading Shigeo Shingo&amp;rsquo;s classic book &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Principles of Lean Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; and applying the basic principles to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/1GrkucLhNqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Best Practices for Maintenance Supervisors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I had the privilege of visiting a large pharmaceutical plant in North Carolina several years ago. It was in response to a presentation I had made on just what should supervisors be doing. My organization was undergoing a work sampling on our 2,800 maintenance supervisors to help us get a handle on what they were actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most managers felt that we had burdened the supervisor with too much administrative work and, as a result, kept them from being on the floor interfacing with operations, providing assistance to the craftsperson and evaluating reliability performance. I wondered if our supervisors comprehended the need for face time and what that meant. I personally needed to get a handle on what I was to define as &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were introduced to the plant&amp;rsquo;s maintenance management team and the dayshift maintenance coach. He had a team of 18 facilities craft persons who maintained the building and environmental equipment for a million-square-foot-plus facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He told about his work day. It began with a 15- to 20-minute team meeting in which updates were made on the day&amp;rsquo;s schedule and plant/corporate performance. Employees identified any unusual situations they envisioned, potential problems and lessons from their completed jobs. Time was always allotted for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The coach reviewed operational impacts, what was planned for the next day, unusual activities for the following week and his expectations for the day. That was their only gathering for the day. The team went to work on their assigned preventive and scheduled work orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So far, I found nothing unusual, until I asked him about &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo; What did this consist of? He replied that each team member was an important, unique person and that he spent at least five minutes a day with each of them. If he could, he tried to see each twice during the day. His job was to assure that they had the resources needed to complete their work. If he received a call, he would respond to the work site for face-to-face assistance. Using the daily work schedule and assignments, he worked his way through the plant, interfacing with operations managers/supervisors about scheduling and priorities and some personal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Face time was personal dialogue. It primarily was exchanges about children, sports, work impacts and other seemingly non-process items. Not so unusual, but this was the primary type of dialogue between him and his team members. He knew their goals in life, spouse&amp;rsquo;s and children&amp;rsquo;s names, some of their home issues, what was happening on the Fourth of July or this summer, and other &amp;ldquo;non-work&amp;rdquo; type stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He headed off our questions about &amp;ldquo;work progress,&amp;rdquo; saying that unless he had something pertinent to scheduling or planning, he seldom initiated that dialogue. If the employee wanted to discuss work, the employee started that conversation. The coach&amp;rsquo;s time was spent maintaining interpersonal relationships with his team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His members were the skilled experts, and he felt they wanted the respect that entailed. How did he determine progress against the work order? During their social interaction, he observed what had been accomplished against the PM checklist or planned work order and could pretty well figure the progress. (He had previously reviewed these documents.) If he thought they may be a bit behind and might need help, he could bring up that &amp;ldquo;Joe was ahead today and could come over to provide another set of hands.&amp;rdquo; Otherwise, unless the employee brought up an issue, the coach stayed out of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toward the end of our visit, several team members came to join us. We expressed our appreciation for their coach but wanted their take on his approach to &amp;ldquo;coaching&amp;rdquo; them. To a person, they expressed their gratitude for their &amp;ldquo;boss.&amp;rdquo; They felt needed, respected and trusted. If the coach had asked them how they were doing or if they needed any help, they would have interpreted that as interfering with their responsibilities. The coach was always available to them, if they needed him. They looked forward to his visit each day. They knew him first as a person and second as their coach who represented the company to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Would they take a higher-paying job at the competitor down the road? No way! Did we know that if an employee found a seminar, a conference, a course or a new tool, he was encouraged to pursue it with company money? &amp;ldquo;We have a responsibility to provide the best product we can. We enjoy doing that, and it is more than appreciated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their plant had been evaluated against similar plants on reliability and cost-effectiveness and was considered the maintenance benchmark plant for their company and several of their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now I had an example of &amp;ldquo;face time&amp;rdquo; that represented a best practice. It requires planned floor time with a set agenda. However, it is only possible with a plant-wide mind-set about the empowerment that employees would appreciate, having the pillars of maintenance excellence in place that supports supervisors as well as the team members, and providing the information, training and communication within an atmosphere of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/3iIrBWFhljE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Signs You are in the Real World of Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who has ever done plant maintenance improvement work is inevitably accused at times of just not knowing what it&amp;rsquo;s like in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance. So, here are some of the things I remember from that &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can&amp;rsquo;t ever get on the paging system because it is always tied up with people paging for maintenance help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel have to carry more than one beeper because one is always busy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel really need to work on their responsiveness because they have trouble responding to more than one page at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel are constantly driving by in really fast yellow carts with bright flashing lights and sirens. (Some are actually dressed in blue tights with red capes.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone really supports the planning and scheduling of maintenance work, as long as they can get a one-day turnaround on their work orders.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The only maintenance scheduler who could ever come close to handling the job used to be a short-order cook.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people say, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll get to the PMs sometime, but we&amp;rsquo;ve just got too many repairs to make.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others say, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have time to keep the machines in good condition. We&amp;rsquo;re too busy with projects to modify them to make them work better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people believe voice mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some believe e-mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others believe they are the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The maintenance backlog got to be so big that we made some real money selling it to a lumber company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone agrees that maintenance needs to focus more on strategically supporting the business, but from the discussions, that seems to mean that we need to be able to do emergency repairs faster.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People say we just can&amp;rsquo;t worry about the cost of an emergency repair. It&amp;rsquo;s like Jack Bauer says: &amp;ldquo;Whatever it takes.&amp;rdquo; The time to worry is at month&amp;rsquo;s end, when everyone is really excited about how far you are over budget.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are cab drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts from suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are limo drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts at the airport.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We have a couple of machines that vacationed in Hawaii on frequent-flier miles built up on parts air-shipped in for them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone says it is just so much faster to buy a part than to try to find it in the parts room.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you really need a maintenance mechanic, you can usually find one on the receiving dock waiting for rush parts to show up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At any given time, there are more maintenance people trying to find or buy parts than there are working on machinery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had to expand the parts room so all the people looking for parts could fit in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is no point even considering anyone as a parts supplier who only delivers once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When asked about how maintenance is scheduled, people quote the &amp;ldquo;S*** Happens&amp;rdquo; slogan from the movie &amp;ldquo;Forrest Gump&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We don&amp;rsquo;t bother updating the weekly maintenance schedule since we never get any of the work on it done; it is always good for next week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We discussed whether it was possible that a machine could need so much ongoing maintenance, that it was theoretically never available for production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One of our mechanics works an incredible amount of overtime. We think it may be that he really can&amp;rsquo;t go home anymore, as his attack chihuahua doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People stopped using beepers for maintenance emergencies and went back to the audio paging system because it was too difficult to get that tone of frantic urgency across with more than just a hint of accusation on a beeper.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The police department keeps showing up asking about mechanics who left their homes days ago, telling their families they were just going in for a few hours to help out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our hardware bins are overflowing with really neat nuts, bolts and fittings that we&amp;rsquo;re sure are really useful for something, but we always seem to run out of the ones we actually use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The plant manager put in some low-priority work orders that he told us we could get to when we had time, but the maintenance manager said we better get them all done by noon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our planner is a great mechanic who really helps us find the quickest, best ways to do things, and always makes sure we have everything we need. We get a lot more done because of him, and avoid a lot of lost-time issues we would have otherwise. But managers keep asking why we&amp;rsquo;re wasting such a great mechanic on paperwork when he could be really helping with emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators have come up with a lot of small improvements that they need our help with, but we&amp;rsquo;re told we can&amp;rsquo;t waste our time on them since we really need to stay focused on the big issues, because that&amp;rsquo;s obviously where all the money really is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There was a role clarification meeting between operations and maintenance management, and it seems like the outcome was quite clear. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely their job to break the machines, and our job to fix them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had some informal shared meetings between maintenance and operating folk to discuss current issues and, you know, it was really amazing how many things we actually agreed on as the right thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>3 Ways to Achieve Successful Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is important to every manufacturing operation. Successful reliability requires communication, cooperation and coordination. To learn the importance of these three Cs, let&amp;rsquo;s examine how your organization is structured and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much does unscheduled downtime cost and where does the responsibility for that unscheduled downtime lie? Is the unscheduled downtime because someone unilaterally decided to run to failure, or is it because the work request was in the &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; but not responded to in a timely fashion to preclude the unscheduled downtime caused by an unscheduled failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a competent operator know when there is an anomaly with the equipment? Since a good operator is a living, breathing data-acquisition machine, the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; In the state of normal operation, good operators are cognizant of anomalies in the equipment they operate approximately one-fourth of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A follow-up question that progressive, reliability-focused management should be asking is: &amp;ldquo;What is preventing the competent operator from communicating the impending failures of the equipment to the &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; early enough to develop good job plans, identify the needed materials and resources, and schedule the repair in a timeframe that reduces unscheduled, expensive downtime and instead allows a quality repair to be done at a time that minimally impacts productivity?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a craft-qualified, ethical maintenance tech have a desire to leave his name on a less-than-quality repair? As with the competent operator, the answer to this question is another resounding statement, &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; Just as the competent operator wants to be known for producing a quality product at the desired rate, a qualified maintenance tech desires to leave his name on a quality repair that will not fail and be classified as a &amp;ldquo;maintenance-induced failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This leads to another follow-up question that management should be asking: &amp;ldquo;What is causing less-than-quality repairs?&amp;rdquo; Do the materials management personnel, storeroom attendants and purchasing buyers feel frustrated because the management-designed &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; allows them to be the scapegoat for obviously controllable, but voluntarily uncontrolled product loss due to unscheduled downtime? Yes. You either voluntarily control downtime or voluntarily allow it to happen in an uncontrolled manner. The controlled or uncontrolled downtime is in the system that management has developed or allowed to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is management&amp;rsquo;s mindset regarding efficiency and effectiveness? For example, take a NASCAR pit stop. Which is more effective and efficient &amp;ndash; a pit stop that is scheduled, albeit in a short timeframe, or one that just happens somewhere on the oval track? It may seem like a rather inane question, but consider what you allow to happen routinely in your production-centric environment. Do you try to milk the last bit out of your system, ignoring the fact that well-maintained equipment is much more reliable and productive than ill-maintained equipment? Perhaps you are merely hoping that your stock car will get seven more laps on those bald tires and that the telemetry data on fuel usage is inaccurate. If the tires don&amp;rsquo;t make the seven laps or the fuel telemetry is accurate, you may end up with zero points in the standings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Are your customers happy with getting the product that they contracted for, within specific parameters, delivered in a haphazard manner and time frame? You probably don&amp;rsquo;t accept transactions that way in your personal life. You expect the terms and conditions of the agreement to be met. The clients that purchase your company&amp;rsquo;s products expect the same fulfillment of their contracted expectations. If these expectations are not met for your customer, they will find another supplier because it is a competitive marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is the answer. Just as you expect your vehicle to start when you put the key into the ignition and turn it, so you have the same expectations with your manufacturing equipment. A major difference between your personal vehicle and manufacturing assets is that your personal vehicle is probably only driven by you, whereas the manufacturing equipment is operated by a succession of qualified people. This takes us back to the importance of the &amp;ldquo;system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How is your system designed? Are the communication, cooperation and coordination between the support pillars of your organization functional? In assessing how well your plant stacks up on the three Cs, start by answering some fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being identified while they are small and not affecting the quality and quantity of your product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being addressed in a manner that minimizes adverse effects on equipment uptime?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a mutual acceptance of responsibility and ownership between the operation function and the maintenance function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operations should do an excellent job in making the product, while maintenance should provide quality and timely preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM) and a well-managed and functional inventory in the storeroom, which is under maintenance control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both operations and maintenance must form a viable partnership of communication, cooperation and coordination of activities to ensure timely repair of identified malfunctions before minor malfunctions become catastrophic and affect productivity. There must be a realistic business case decision to manage between the short-term and long-term gain. You must be willing to take a short production loss now, in a controlled manner, scheduled at a time that minimizes the effect on productivity, rather than wait and take a longer, more devastating hit on productivity at a later date because you have chosen the uncontrolled path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be on a proactive, world-class path requires organizational functions to be mutually supportive, to communicate needs and observations, and to coordinate the effort, time, resources and knowledge necessary for mutual success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Learning Can Change Behavior, Produce Results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people are familiar with A3 analysis as a management process &amp;ndash; a methodology for thinking, planning, problem-solving and then starting all over again. In this process, you begin by defining the problem, describing the current conditions, and defining goals and targets (what&amp;rsquo;s the desired outcome?). Next, you analyze what has caused the gap between current conditions and the desired outcome, and you design a countermeasure to help you reach the future state. Then, the A3 process calls for planning who will do what, plus a follow-up step to capture what has happened, what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what issues remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many elements of this A3 analysis apply to planning for and implementing effective learning strategies. There&amp;rsquo;s a big gap when it comes to workplace learning &amp;ndash; the gap between what often constitutes training and the desired outcome of improved performance. If you invest in learning and nothing changes, has learning taken place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often we invest our time and money in a learning event only to find that when we return to our daily work, we keep doing the same things. It all sounds so good, and you are so excited to put the new methods and tools you have learned into practice, but when you get back to the workplace, the boss is still asking the same questions and expecting the same results. The processes in your workplace could also be different than those described in the class, causing you to struggle with how to apply what you have learned in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning is not an event &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a process. The classroom is important, but the fact is that most learning takes place when we apply the tools and techniques we discovered in the learning event. Learning is a process of alignment, assimilation and application. We&amp;#39;ll call this the 3A learning process. Only by completing all three steps of this process can we change behavior to produce desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Align&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before participating in a learning event, participants should have a thorough understanding of what they are expected to learn, how their behavior is expected to change, the results they are expected to achieve and how these results contribute to the overall goals of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When this step is skipped, participants attend the learning event and are left entirely on their own to determine what they are supposed to do with what they learn. This often leads to a disconnect between participants and their leaders when they return to the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, when you attend a Leading People class with a dozen learning objectives, you discover some new tools for gaining group consensus. You know this is something you can apply right away to make some decisions in your work team. Returning to work, you share your ideas with your manager only to find that what your manager really wanted you to learn was how to facilitate the creation of a team vision. This was covered in the class, but not knowing this was why you had been selected to attend the class, you focused your attention on what you perceived to be an important skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the A3 management process requires both an assessment of the current state and a description of the desired outcome, 3A learning requires managers and employees to clearly define the desired outcome before the learning event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assimilate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the learning event, you focus on assimilating the learning that resonates with you. An effective learning event will engage you in applying what you already know in building relevant skills and knowledge that you decide to focus on and practice in the class. If these vital elements of an effective learning event are part of the assimilation, then you will return to work prepared to apply what you have learned. If not, then you may have an awareness of and even a desire to apply these tools but no practical experience in how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether assimilation happens effectively largely depends on who is leading your learning event. An instructor is a content resource and usually shares knowledge through writing or lectures, appearing as a &amp;ldquo;sage on the stage.&amp;rdquo; A facilitator is a process manager first and a content resource second. Facilitators use their knowledge of how people learn to create an active environment that embraces participants&amp;rsquo; prior knowledge and unique learning styles. When they facilitate, they appear as a &amp;ldquo;guide by the side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thinking back to the A3 management process, when you plan a countermeasure to an existing gap or problem, you want to plan the best countermeasure possible. When it comes to learning events, seek out events that take into account your learning style, your skills and your knowledge. This will ensure what you learn will stick with you when returning to work to apply what you have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying what you have learned is where 80 percent of the learning takes place. This involves using the skills and knowledge within your work environment that makes the learning stick, causing a behavior change that produces desired results. In this step, it is important that you experience early success. This early success depends on leadership support and coaching. Left on your own, you are likely to discover unique factors in your work environment that make it difficult to apply what you have learned. The system and often the people resist change. Since learning is changing behavior, you will encounter resistance. You will need someone supporting you with encouragement, coaching and running interference as you attempt to adapt your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the A3 management process requires a follow-up step to review the outcome and a follow-up step to capture what has happened, what was learned and what issues remain, the 3A learning process requires the manager and employee to evaluate the learning that has taken place, the progress of changing behavior and how the environment is adapting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you consider your future investments in training, remember the 3A learning process &amp;ndash; align, assimilate and apply &amp;ndash; and the result will be learning that changes behavior to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Secrets for an Effective Bill of Materials</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If your company was manufacturing automobiles, appliances, iPads or even cardboard boxes, you certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think about scheduling production without a complete and accurate bill of materials (BOM) for each finished product so you could determine your raw material requirements from a master schedule. So why is it that many process industries not only begin operation without equipment BOMs, but go for years &amp;ndash; sometimes decades &amp;ndash; without them?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When we ask people to assess the quality of their equipment BOMs, the comments we get most often are: &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t exist,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We have some of the data, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s accurate.&amp;rdquo; When we ask why that&amp;rsquo;s the case, the response is usually: &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have the information,&amp;rdquo; or more likely, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to do all that work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	So instead of taking the time to build and maintain the BOMs, they just go on without them. That means planners, maintenance and reliability engineers, mechanics, materials management and procurement personnel, and others have to go outside the system to do things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine material requirements for planned work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Query and locate parts for emergency and other unplanned work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Associate critical spares to specific assets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate part substitutions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assess non-moving material for obsolescence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify opportunities for part standardization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Somehow there&amp;rsquo;s time for most of these workarounds, and although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to calculate, it probably takes two to 10 times as much effort to deal with the lack of information as it would to just fix the problem in the first place. Unfortunately, the focus is on the reactive aspects of what &amp;ldquo;really needs to be done&amp;rdquo; and not on the proactive aspects of getting the information into the system. If you don&amp;rsquo;t keep up, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to catch up. So what are the five critical success factors for establishing and maintaining effective BOMs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. The most important thing you can do is get the information into the system as early as possible. As soon as you have made a commitment to buy a new piece of equipment, you should be on the phone with the manufacturer or supplier to get the BOM information. Unless there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility that something could change, you should have the BOM data in the system even before the equipment is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Don&amp;rsquo;t kill yourself trying to get every last little item into the database. If your system supports an automatic upload of BOM data from an electronic file, then take advantage of it. However, if you have to enter the data manually, make sure you get the most important stuff in there first. A good rule of thumb is that anything you reasonably expect to repair and/or replace should go on the BOM, with the exception of consumables and free issue parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Make sure you have a robust process in place to manage changes to the asset base. Whether you call it &amp;ldquo;management of change,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;configuration management&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Mikey,&amp;rdquo; the important thing is that all equipment redesigns, material changes, part substitutions or even significant modifications are assessed to determine the impact on the BOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget about retired assets. How many times have you had someone look at an expensive or supposedly critical part that hasn&amp;rsquo;t moved in the storeroom and heard them say, &amp;ldquo;Oh, we stopped using those years ago when we took out the &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (whatever). It&amp;rsquo;s so much easier and cost-effective to deal with these situations as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5. Make it part of the culture. This isn&amp;rsquo;t something that can be done randomly or easily driven from the bottom up. It requires management commitment to make it a priority, with clearly defined responsibilities and expectations for each person involved in establishing and maintaining the integrity of the BOMs and accountability for making sure it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy. The easy thing is to do nothing and continue to live with the consequences. Even if you can&amp;rsquo;t erase all the mistakes of the past, at least put something in place to keep the situation from getting worse. Once you can keep up, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Involve the Right People for Effective Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&amp;rdquo; the white rabbit is eternally behind schedule and skittishly hyperactive. What is easily overlooked is his firm grasp of the subtle intricacies of effective change management. For example, he off-handedly advises Alice, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something, stand there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although this statement initially appears counterintuitive &amp;ndash; after all, much of formal change management is getting individuals to actually do things differently &amp;ndash; the change will only be effective when the right people do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oftentimes during change, so much emphasis is placed on end results that we take shortcuts on the way those end results are achieved. For instance, during a recent engagement, a client was implementing a new process for the operators to follow. To meet the expectation of a speedy implementation, the area manager intended to provide the process training to the operators. On the surface, that might not sound like a bad idea. However, by doing so, the manager was missing a valuable opportunity to engage the line supervisors in the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When questioned, the area manager felt that the line supervisors were not as familiar with the new process as she was and would not be able to provide effective training. Once she said it out loud, she realized that she would be better off taking time to train the supervisors and leverage them to train and coach the employees on the new processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During another implementation, visual control boards were being installed at each manufacturing cell. The operators were made responsible for filling out the hourly production totals. As expected, some operators were filling out the boards consistently, while others were, shall we say, less consistent. The change-management facilitator assigned to the project took the opportunity to show the operators how to fill out the information correctly. The question posed to the facilitator was, &amp;ldquo;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the supervisor addressing this?&amp;rdquo; The response was, &amp;ldquo;They are very busy, and I just want to help them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the facilitator&amp;rsquo;s dedication is admirable, the truth is that unless the supervisors take ownership of their operators&amp;rsquo; performance, this change is doomed to early failure. In this case, the facilitator should observe but take no direct action. The next step would be to share his observations with the sponsor and create a plan to coach the supervisors on performance expectations and additional training on what to look for and how to address deficiencies. This effectively transfers ownership of the process to the appropriate individuals and greatly increases the potential for effective, sustained change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taken literally, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something, stand there&amp;rdquo; is overly simplistic. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to do nothing but to think through the process and make sure that the right things are getting done the right way. Whoa &amp;hellip; gotta go. They are calling for final boarding, and I&amp;rsquo;m late, I&amp;rsquo;m late&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Use Key Performance-based Metrics </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive global environment, we are constantly being asked to do more with less. Now more than ever, companies are asking their employees to become more productive, more efficient and more &amp;ldquo;lean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Strategic planning, value stream mapping, reliability engineering, loss elimination &amp;ndash; these phrases have become popular from the boardroom to the shop floor. But where does their value really lie? How do we make decisions that uncover value, eliminate loss and allow for proper strategic planning for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answer lies not in the decisions we make but in the data we use to make those decisions. Good, strong data is key to making good, strong decisions. We are all familiar with the axiom of &amp;ldquo;garbage in, garbage out.&amp;rdquo; So what kind of data should we use? What metrics give us the best snapshot of our current levels of performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asset utilization (AU) and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) are key performance-based metrics that, when calculated and communicated properly, allow for effective facility management and provide sound backing for potentially difficult business decisions to be made. However, much confusion lies in their definition and understanding when and where to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AU is defined as: availability x rate x quality&lt;br /&gt;
	OEE is defined as: uptime x rate x quality&lt;br /&gt;
	As you can see, AU and OEE are similar &amp;ndash; both calculations for rate and quality are the same, and are defined as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/9427c4a5-6466-4d8e-a2bf-7bef27e61365_AU and OEE image 1.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where average rate is the speed or efficiency of the system under analysis over a given time period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best demonstrated or design rate is determined by the nameplate capacity of the system or the best demonstrated rate recorded. I prefer to use the best demonstrated rate, as empirical data is a better model of the system in question. A 100-percent rate calculation would signal that the system is operating consistently at its maximum demonstrated speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/fc289d33-e998-459c-bcc8-01dc1ae596a1_AU and OEE image 2.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where first pass units is defined as the good units produced over a certain time period that meet customer specifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These &amp;ldquo;quality&amp;rdquo; units are compared to the total units produced, including those that do not meet customer specifications. A 100-percent quality calculation would signify no scrap or rework in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on the above formulas, you can easily see that the difference between OEE and AU lies in how you compare availability and uptime. So what is the difference? Availability and uptime are defined as follows:&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/dc027bfb-15b2-4a86-be25-4ee59bf4f14d_AU and OEE image 3.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 151px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where operating time is defined as the amount of time that the system is actually operating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Calendar time is based on the 24/7/365 schedule as we know it. Scheduled time is defined as the amount of time the system under analysis was planned or scheduled to operate. Therefore, if I operate my system for six hours on one eight-hour shift during a given day, my uptime is 6/8 or 75 percent, while my availability is 6/24 or 25 percent. That is quite a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, OEE is used to understand how well systems or assets perform based on current business demands and production schedules. AU allows for a better understanding of how well that system or asset is currently utilized and allows insight for future business planning by calculating what type of production could be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In some industries (petroleum, specialty chemical, etc.), scheduled time is equal to calendar time. In this case, availability equals uptime, so OEE and AU are equal. This scenario is similar to how a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle isn&amp;rsquo;t a square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to understand the terminology. My background in Six Sigma differentiated between availability and uptime for AU and OEE, respectively. Lean terminology defines OEE as the product of availability x rate x quality, with availability defined in the same way uptime is defined (above). So which is correct? The truth is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. What is important is to clearly define what you and your organization are trying to capture, agree on common terminology to allow for clear and concise discussion, and determine the best way to capture the needed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As always, the devil is in the details. When setting up data-capture systems to determine rate and quality and uptime/availability calculations, take care to ensure consistent measurement and data validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, AU and OEE can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/fc89fb18-130d-406f-a0c2-695af5b34c6e_AU and OEE image 4.jpeg" style="width: 646px; height: 237px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Get More Maintenance Work Done with Proper Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Famous financier Bernard Baruch was often quoted as saying, &amp;ldquo;Two and two still and always will equal four.&amp;rdquo; This, some would say, quaint concept has fallen out of favor more and more in recent years, as clearly the restrictiveness of basic arithmetic is not something that should continue to bind us in today&amp;rsquo;s brave new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s much more useful if two and two can equal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever analysts are expecting it to be (or better).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever your boss wants it to be.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever will make this current project justifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping this in mind, some odd-looking math that actually works in plant maintenance is the rule that:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This rule is a huge help with another rule that is always pretty much true:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In most plants, there are never enough maintenance people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I have 10 maintenance mechanics and the backlog just keeps growing, how can you get more maintenance work done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hiring more people is usually a long and difficult process, and always the longest, most difficult part is getting the approval (usually, rightly so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contractors are an option and will definitely get the work done (and usually best for specialized tasks), but they can eat up the budget pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overtime eats budgets, too, and also burns people out after not too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can also just beat on everyone to get more done, but that becomes counterproductive fairly quickly. Plus, since you&amp;rsquo;re typically working in a broken process to begin with, how much more can you really get done? Work ethic (except in a small number of cases) isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem. However, frustration can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or, you can just live (or try to), as many do, with the anxiety, excitement, frustration and consequences of not getting done what really needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But suppose you take your best, most organized mechanic and put him in a planning role, charging him and the group with using him solely as a resource to work with them to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the best, quickest way of doing a job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify materials, tools, etc., needed to do that job in the best way. This way, they can be prepped ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work with the supervisor (or scheduler) to build a schedule based on realistic resource times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This way, you get more done with the people you have just by not wasting their time. (Believe it or not, the majority of people actually like this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, many times the response to this proposal is a variety of colorful expressions, all unflattering and casting unkind doubt about various attributes and the heredity of the proposer. Milder ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;How can we afford to give up a mechanic to become a planner? There&amp;rsquo;s just too much work to get done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;You want us to take our best mechanic out of the workforce and have him do paperwork? Are you nuts?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But numbers that various reputable surveys have pulled together over the years typically and consistently show that the usual unplanned maintenance work setup results in an actual working time (or so-called wrench-turning time) of about 35 percent of the available time of mechanics. The rest of the time is spent in many other ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Traveling to and from the job site and various other places (maintenance shop, parts room, lunchroom, washroom, receiving dock, supervisor&amp;rsquo;s office, engineer&amp;rsquo;s office, production manager&amp;rsquo;s office, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waiting for equipment to become available (behind schedule because of an earlier breakdown)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determining how to do the job and what materials, etc., are needed (traveling to all those places above and consulting with them)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting materials (after you find them; if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then you have to go through your determining process again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting tools (unless someone else is using them or didn&amp;rsquo;t put them back, then you have a finding process)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting help when needed (traveling and consulting again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tool cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same surveys typically show that on a well-planned, scheduled basis, actual working time rises to about 65 percent of the available time with all the non-working time components being significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So if you convert one mechanic out of your 10 to a planner, you have nine mechanics working at 65 percent vs. the previous 35 percent. Thus, effectively you now have 16.5 of your current 35 percent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You just added 6.5 mechanics by moving to planned and scheduled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5&amp;Prime;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;Buy 1 and get 6.5 free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on this, how can you afford not to commit to a planner? Some would say, &amp;ldquo;Most of our work is emergency work anyway with no time for planning, so how can a planner help?&amp;rdquo; Well, the key is just to start.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There has to be some work being done in scheduled downtime, where there is some time for planning. Start with that. If you start to get the scheduled repair work done much faster and better (or even just close to the time you estimated) in the scheduled downtime, then amazingly you start to be able to get the preventive maintenance work done in the scheduled downtime rather than skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without PM inspections, there is no hope of getting away from a lot of emergency work. But with them, there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspections generate work orders for more non-immediate repair work that can be planned and scheduled &amp;mdash; work that you actually get done (and done right). Emergency work &amp;mdash; the most inefficient use of resources &amp;mdash; begins to go down. You then begin to start a cycle of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many other good things start to happen, too &amp;mdash; a major one being that you begin to get more credibility. That opens a lot of doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, dramatic reduction doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight. There is individual and group training, developing the process, getting acceptance and commitment to get the process going, and some system setup. But it does begin to have an effect very quickly. Just start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK. So you don&amp;rsquo;t get all of your additional mechanics right away, but you start to get some. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get the planning and scheduling system good enough to get them all, you&amp;rsquo;re still well ahead of where you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment I always heard after a planning system was in place was, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting a lot more work done.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Share the Responsibility for PM Attainment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance (PM) is a cornerstone of reliability-based maintenance. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise then that PM attainment has become a key performance indicator (KPI). However, it may surprise you that in many organizations, maintenance is not primarily responsible for this KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance always has an important role, of course. It must create the PM program. It must generate, schedule and plan PMs. It also must have staff with enough skill to accomplish the PM. If maintenance is missing any of these things, it has a lot of work to do. But if PM attainment is already one of your current KPIs, these steps are probably already being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet if those planned PMs are not being accomplished, there is another likely reason besides maintenance capability. The most common reason for scheduled PMs not being accomplished is a change in the production schedule removing access to equipment and lines that were scheduled for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This doesn&amp;rsquo;t absolve maintenance for missing PM due to other reasons. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the material, people or tools on hand or has poorly estimated the necessary work, maintenance should be accountable. However, big blocks of PM tasks are often missed due to a change in the production schedule. This usually is not in the control of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason the schedule changes is often due to a short-term need for more production, frequently while there are complaints about the machinery not running well enough. Yet even when the reason for extending the production schedule is to overcome maintenance downtime, the stage has been set for even more downtime to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To hold me responsible for a KPI, I should have the means to control it. If I am the maintenance manager, I rarely control the production schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I like using PM attainment as a metric, my suggestion is for it to be a shared metric among both the production manager and maintenance manager (as well as the production planning staff, if you have one). They should all be held accountable if scheduled PM tasks are not being performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/nmCFUBQV3e8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Creating an Environment for Planning and Scheduling Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Too many times and in too many organizations, we send people off to training with high expectations that they will lead change and improvement upon their return. We hope that overnight they have become equipped with the skills and knowledge to effectively start doing their new work. Unfortunately, weeks later, the trainee and his or her organization are frustrated with the lack of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where did we go wrong? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent case that I had the opportunity to witness. ABC Company chose to send its new planner/scheduler off to be trained in the proper procedures for planning and scheduling work. The planner came back to the site with his newly learned planning skills and attempted to plan and schedule work. On the first day back, he attended the normal morning meeting where the issues of the last 24 hours are reviewed and any items left uncorrected are assigned for the day. After the first hour was spent in the meeting, the planner headed off to his office only to be stopped by the maintenance team leader, who needed a hot work permit completed and delivered to Johnny down at the waste-water treatment area so he could get started welding a bracket for a pump. Thirty minutes later, the planner delivered the permit. After a quick break, the planner finally made it to his desk and turned on the computer. Fred and Susan had been watching for the planner to show up, and they pounced, requesting that he requisition some parts they needed for upcoming work the next day. The planner spent the next hour expediting those parts to ensure they would arrive in time for Fred and Susan to do their job. The planner then looked at the clock on the wall, and it was lunch time already. Where does the time go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am going to stop at the half-day mark, but I bet many of you could fill out the rest of the planner&amp;rsquo;s day based on your experience. For that planner at ABC Company, days two through five didn&amp;rsquo;t look much different from the first day back on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we expect different results, then we must do something differently. If we want to move from a reactive environment to a reliability-centered, proactive environment, we must properly plan and schedule work. That work is not today&amp;rsquo;s work (reactive), but next week&amp;rsquo;s work. By planning for next week and beyond, we have the time to get the right parts, prepare the job plan, and properly schedule the equipment and resources to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of creating an environment for success, we have to educate all of the interfacing functions on the proper role of the planner/scheduler and how those other functions contribute to the success of the planning and scheduling work. For example, the daily meeting that reviews the last 24 hours is not the place for the planner, who should be looking out a week and beyond. The maintenance team leader needs to take responsibility for issuing the hot work permit on short notice. In the future, when the job is properly planned, the hot work permit form should be part of the job package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to educating others on the new role, we have to set the proper expectations with that planner/scheduler and hold that person accountable. As an example of educating others, in the case of ABC Company, I used a supervisors&amp;rsquo; training course that I was conducting separately to educate all of the operations and maintenance supervisors on the new role of the planner/scheduler. Next, I spent time with the maintenance technicians to explain the role, how it affected them and whom they should seek out to expedite parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/jfDsVKtOGMg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Answering Common Maintenance Planning Questions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At a recent conference, a number of questions came up that were never properly answered, so I thought I would try to address some of these. The questions involved getting maintenance planners to focus on planning, getting them focused on future work and allowing time to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at roles. The planner should be strategic and focused on future work (i.e., next week and beyond). The supervisor, team leader or lead person should be tactical or focused on today and this week. If parts are needed this week, it&amp;rsquo;s not the planner but the supervisor who should be dealing with it. The same goes for emergencies; we can&amp;rsquo;t plan and schedule them, so they should not normally involve planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning group should be a separate group. The planners should have craft skills; often, they are some of your best craftspeople. However, if you have your planners attending the production meeting where the last 24 hours are reviewed, shame on you. How can the planner focus on the future when you have them focused on today? Watch what happens in the meeting. The day&amp;rsquo;s priorities change before they leave the meeting. Don&amp;rsquo;t put your planners there. Instead, use the supervisors who are dealing with today anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about having supervisors do some planning? Supervisors have to deal with the reactive chaos of today and this week, so the first thing thrown out the window is planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may even look at where your planners are located. If they are in the hub of activity, centered in the shop areas, the interruptions will keep them from planning and scheduling. You want them accessible, but you also want them to have the time to be able to focus on planning. You may have to find another location to get them away from interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need to have good work-management processes so that your planners don&amp;rsquo;t end up simply shagging parts all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about your partnership with the storeroom/materials management? It takes a while to locate all the parts needed if you have not built your bill of materials in a CMMS/EAM. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good priority matrix and aren&amp;rsquo;t holding people accountable to it, this creates more time loss for the planners in responding to the wrong priority work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a manager, you have to take the steps to encourage the planners to focus on the future. In addition, you need to reward the right behaviors. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to reward people for jumping into the fire every day and resolving the issues at hand. These activities tend to be fast-paced, and they can be seen as the solution provider, the go-to person. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you recognize these activities as chaotic and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/7z8MSvYAcWs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Defining the Role of a Maintenance Planner</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations should have a clear work description of what a planner&amp;rsquo;s role is. The role may vary between organizations, mainly due to plant size. Some organizations have combined planners/supervisors. Some have dedicated planners for shutdowns/turnarounds. Many have people with a planner&amp;rsquo;s title but no planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So how do we figure out a planner&amp;rsquo;s role? The first step is to decide if you (as a plant) want to have planning. In my opinion, it would be a huge mistake to decide against planning, but if you do, you might as well get rid of planners and/or the role of planning. Most of us will decide we should have planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We can&amp;rsquo;t figure out a clear role unless we first have a clear, agreed-upon workflow that describes in which order we are going to pass on information, to whom and who is responsible. Therefore, the first step is to design clear, agreed-upon workflows (business processes) for our daily work, shutdown work, etc. Once we have the workflows, we can start describing the role of planners (and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be aware when you start describing the role that it is easy to describe all the things a planner should do in a lengthy document. I have seen role descriptions for planners that instruct the planner to do absolutely everything that no one else has time or wants to do. If you have an all-inclusive role description for planners in your plant, perhaps you need to think again. We are often afraid of having a description that allows a planner to say, &amp;ldquo;That is not my job.&amp;rdquo; However, I want to argue that it is critical that a planner says &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to certain assignments. This is because your planners should primarily be planning. If you divert them in emergency work, special projects, supervision, etc., they will be doing those things and not planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we at IDCON describe the planner&amp;rsquo;s role, we often start in the opposite end. We describe what a planner should not do, then describe what a planner should work on. We see the no-no list being used more than the actual work description in day-to-day work. What follows is a typical no-no list for a planner&amp;rsquo;s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A planner should not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan emergency work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Act as a relief supervisor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Become a material expeditor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work on tools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform time-consuming clerical activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan from behind a desk only&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Become a &amp;ldquo;go-fer&amp;rdquo; for maintenance/operations supervisors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason for the no-no list is that all of the activities will reduce the amount of planned work you have in your facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/IltSrwA3qS8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Achieve Effective Maintenance Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As Sisyphus well knew, pushing things up mountains is difficult, and the uphill struggle from the reactive to the proactive maintenance world is often a frustrating &amp;ldquo;three steps forward, two steps back&amp;rdquo; process. That&amp;rsquo;s a major reason why so many slide back into the familiar, ugly, day-to-day, survival morass at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of those steps on the way up is where preventive maintenance inspections are getting done, we&amp;rsquo;re finding things that need to be fixed and we&amp;rsquo;re fixing them. However, we&amp;rsquo;re still not getting that much better. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fixing the same things over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The famous quote, &amp;ldquo;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it,&amp;rdquo; remains as true as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, the &amp;ldquo;find it, fix it and move on&amp;rdquo; mode is a big step up from the &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look or feel like great improvement, so many get discouraged and tend to look for faster, more rewarding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the maintenance planner can really make a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An item I emphasize in maintenance planning and scheduling classes is the importance of the planner. One of the planner&amp;rsquo;s first activities on the job is to check to see if we&amp;rsquo;ve done this work before on this or similar equipment. If we can get the planning information from previous work (even copy the work order), a huge amount of the planner&amp;rsquo;s time is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement for planner productivity and accuracy, but what&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for maintenance and operational improvement is that now the planner is looking at the number of times the same work has been done before. This tends to raise the questions of why and what can we do about it. That way, we don&amp;rsquo;t just keep making that same repair over and over again. We get folks together and work on it. Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s an operational or equipment care gap that we can fix pretty quickly. Now, we really start to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a case of a motor that kept burning out every six months or so. It was a small motor, and someone different was always making the fix on a different shift. It was a pretty quick replacement, so it took a while to get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sprocket had been replaced on an emergency repair, and since the right one wasn&amp;rsquo;t in stock, the closest one was substituted. No follow-up work order was written to make the right replacement. The motor was overloaded, but not tremendously, so it took a while to die. Of course, it seemed that we were always replacing small motors anyway. Therefore, why would this one stand out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if you search for that work in a CMMS system, the list of occurrences jumps up right away, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious we need to ask why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big issues in plants are usually well-known and as a result have a somewhat reasonable chance of getting attention. But the planner is really the only one looking at all the repairs and is likely to see patterns in the smaller ones. Routinely finding and fixing small items is a key indicator of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, using history requires a few things, the biggest of which is a value for using history. As a society, we&amp;rsquo;d rather jump in and just do it and not &amp;ldquo;waste time&amp;rdquo; researching because &amp;ldquo;this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different.&amp;rdquo; So managers need to encourage planners to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, there&amp;rsquo;s concern that if we don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, we&amp;rsquo;ve wasted that research time. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long. Besides, we&amp;rsquo;re learning what information needs to be there and can fix work orders that aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quality of the information is key. The 60- or 80-character work description is the most significant information seen when a work order listing is pulled up. Therefore, that needs to tell the story clearly. A work request description often states an issue, but the final description should describe the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Something else I recommend is routinely visiting completed work orders to make sure all useful information is captured. Unfortunately, completing paperwork does not have the same value for all personnel, and everyone does not know or understand the use and significance of the various work order fields. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s always useful to actually talk to mechanics to find out how things went and what could have been better in the plan. That&amp;rsquo;s how we get better at planning, too. Effective planning is always a team activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Maintenance Planning and Scheduling for Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/8/d9cac24a-2254-4f7a-87c2-c21621ca39bc_planning-scheduling.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While on a recent flight to Atlanta, I was leafing through a maintenance book when the person across the aisle struck up a conversation. Turns out, he worked as a veteran maintenance supervisor in a large mill where he has worked for the last two years. He spoke about how things were bad from a reactive standpoint and had gotten worse after the mill downsized. As part of the downsizing effort, they had removed some key players and replaced them with some not-so-key players. We talked about how their maintenance planning and scheduling activities were progressing, to which he was disappointed in the progress they had achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that he had two maintenance planners/schedulers with a span of control of about 1:25, yet he was still doing a tremendous amount of planning and scheduling himself. He commented that the span of 1:25 fell within the best practices guidelines. In addition, he mentioned from previous training that he learned that a planner should be able to plan three jobs per day, but the planners were unable to accomplish this amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some additional conversation, we came to understand some of the opportunities present at the mill. I bet you could relate to the rest of the story: Management is dysfunctional. The storeroom is in disarray. The CMMS/EAM system was poorly implemented, and if a part existed in stores, you could not find it in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So let&amp;rsquo;s look as some possible solutions to help this gentleman. There never is but one silver bullet that will fix this stuff, and often it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that a good job plan can start out with three items: the crafts required, the estimated hours needed, and the parts and materials. These three items are an excellent start, provided that you have a process for continuous improvement, also called a feedback loop. When the crafts execute the job, they should write down additional information to improve the plan, such as tools or additional parts required and task steps. When the planner gets this information back, he updates the plan so it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the next use. You might be able to enlist the help of a clerical person (if you are short on planner resources) who does well tippy-tapping on the keyboard. By approaching job plans in this manner, you may find that a planner can successfully plan more than three jobs per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all of that said, you still may find planning to be a bottleneck if you are very reactive and the supporting systems have not been well-implemented. While maintenance planning and scheduling can happen when using a paper system instead of computerized tools, it&amp;rsquo;s still dependent on the supporting structures for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if your purchasing process is a nightmare, that can slow down the efforts. If the storeroom and materials management areas are poorly implemented and in shambles, this can affect the planning and scheduling processes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of other factors that can influence maintenance planning and scheduling success, like the support of maintenance supervision. Now you can see why I tell people that formal maintenance planning and scheduling training is only half of the education required. Formal training should be followed up with coaching and mentoring for the maintenance planners/schedulers. This will help identify and enable the removal of obstacles that impede the planning and scheduling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also may want to consider reducing the span of control for your maintenance planners/schedulers. The recommended span of control for maintenance planning and scheduling is 15 to 30 craftspeople per maintenance planner. Supervision is recommended at eight to 15 crafts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/EfVZsRwp2yE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Keys to Maintain Equipment Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is so much similarity in all that we do within the maintenance planning and scheduling world that compares to other separate and distinct functions. Let me explain. Borrowing from root cause analysis process methods, I trust you are familiar with Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams). These diagrams are one method that is used for product design, quality defect avoidance or variation, or to identify factors that lead to some event, hence the use in root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The categories typically include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man (people)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements to perform the tasks, including time estimates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: Any equipment, tools, etc., needed to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: Consumables, parts required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: Data generated from the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these items combine together to create some output or event. In the case of maintenance planning and scheduling, hopefully they combine to maintain or restore the reliability of equipment, as an example. See, in all we do, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that every product (i.e., maintaining equipment) is the result of a process. Let&amp;rsquo;s break them down individually for maintenance planning and scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man: People or staffing (which crafts?), skill requirements, number of people, contractors or vendors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: The job-plan task steps and sequence; items such as permits, manuals and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: What special tools (man lift, ladder, etc.) are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: What consumables or parts are needed to restore the equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: What do we need to know to improve the job plan? In the case of a condition-based monitoring task, we can take measurements to find something in the act of failing to allow planned restoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, all of these items roll up to complete the job plan and job package that should be created by the maintenance planner. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete all of these items, which three should I focus on first to ensure that I could drive craft effectiveness? From a maintenance scheduling perspective, I need the manpower requirements, estimated hours and the materials, but it can&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The only way that it&amp;rsquo;s effective is if I have a continuous improvement loop that relies on the feedback of the technicians to improve the job plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/f6HEKIkcHbw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Execution is Key for Business Strategies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Business strategies developed by companies are often useless. A business strategy is basically a plan for what the company should focus on in the future. It is a promise and guideline to steer a company in the right direction. It&amp;rsquo;s not too different from your personal New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions include things such as losing weight, exercising more, drinking less and improving their marriage in some form. The universal formula for change in any personal-improvement book or business book is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand what to do&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand how to do it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us compare a business strategy with our beloved New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. We know what the problem is, right? We are fat, unhappy, stressed, whatever. We usually know how to improve (drink less, exercise, spend time with the wife), but we fail to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hard truth is that we try a little. We soon realize it is harder to improve than we thought, and we quit. Right? However, the day we get a heart attack, I think most people get a completely new attitude toward exercising, smoking and stress, at least for a while. Of course, there are different reactions. Some people just roll over and wait for the truck to hit, while others start making improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our economic crisis is like a heart attack. Some companies grease their elbows and use the situation to become meaner and leaner. Some are in too bad of shape in order to survive. Others give up. Which company are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time to do the things you didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do before because you were busy making widgets or tons. Take the opportunity to improve your preventive maintenance tasks, revise your planning and scheduling routines, work on your root-cause analysis activities, clean up your storeroom and build that technical database you always cried about not having. Execute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just understanding or thinking about good ideas doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you or your plant/mill/mine anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/PRRlzYV_0k4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Keep Maintenance in a Proactive Mode</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/31/c35d4bbe-c836-4011-b436-f9bc32ec68dc_sisyphus.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;I stumbled across some music trivia lately, that the old rock band Chicago finally had its album &amp;ldquo;Stone of Sisyphus&amp;rdquo; released a few years ago. One of the more famous &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; albums, it was originally recorded in the early 1990s but had languished for years, available only in illegal bootleg copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That reminded me of when I used to use the story of Sisyphus in maintenance training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I never encountered a great number of serious Greek mythology students in those sessions, but was always amazed how mythology suddenly grasped attendees&amp;rsquo; attention when I started telling about Sisyphus showing up in an episode of the TV series &amp;ldquo;Xena: Warrior Princess.&amp;rdquo; A statuesque, obviously very strong gal who always wore a brief, Roman-style leather outfit, Xena had a pretty fair following back in those days, especially it seemed in the typical plant maintenance group. (It was often brought up that the whole educational experience would have been much enhanced with video clips.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was a Greek king who made the mistake of getting the Greek god Zeus really ticked off at him. He supposedly did this by leaking stories to the press of that time about some of Zeus&amp;rsquo; indiscretions. So Sisyphus was sentenced to spend the rest of eternity &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; every day, all day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; laboriously pushing a huge boulder up a mountain. Then in the evening, he was to stand aside and watch it roll all the way back down to the bottom. Then the next day, he was to start all over again, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; summer, winter, rain, snow, hot, cold, no vacation, no sick days, not even Christmas (obviously) or New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was pretty much a piece of work who had pulled off some pretty bad stuff himself, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really work up much sympathy for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So Sisyphus is still at it, somewhere out there, I guess, but you know he&amp;rsquo;s not alone. Keeping maintenance in a proactive mode can be a very similar pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we start out trying to get out of the frenetic &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, getting preventive maintenance inspections going, getting maintenance planning and scheduling going &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; that feels a lot like pushing a boulder up a mountain. (Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s probably harder. Sisyphus didn&amp;rsquo;t have people pushing back on the boulder as he was pushing it up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But as PM inspections get better and better, and people become more routinely conscious of equipment condition and get potential problems dealt with, and emergency work falls off, and we are getting better and better scheduled repairs done, the slope becomes gentler and it is easier to push the boulder. And the higher we get, the easier it is to push, and the air gets clearer, the sky gets bluer, the sun shines, the birds sing, the flowers bloom, we can see for miles, and maybe even Julie Andrews is running around up here singing something about the &amp;ldquo;Sound of Music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a while and some serious effort, we start to get where things start to run more smoothly. We can count on steady, decent production numbers every day. We don&amp;rsquo;t have aggravating breakdowns. We don&amp;rsquo;t have that routine, yet always unexpected, excess overtime that messes up people&amp;rsquo;s lives. (I remember the days of really hoping to make it through Friday without a disaster so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to ruin some people&amp;rsquo;s, and my own, weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we do planned repair work, we have pretty much everything ready, so it goes well and we get done what we had planned, pretty much how we planned it. We have a process in place where operations and maintenance folks routinely identify and analyze our problems and make permanent fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, it becomes really tempting to try to walk away from the boulder, because you know, it looks like maybe it will stay there by itself. It seems pretty secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe now we can start skipping some PMs. Maybe we can pull our maintenance planner for some other work. Maybe we can use our &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; maintenance resources for that project we can&amp;rsquo;t quite justify otherwise. Maybe maintenance doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to come to the production meetings anymore (there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many people showing up there now anyway). Maybe we just don&amp;rsquo;t need to demonstrate that much commitment to routine maintenance anymore. It seems to be pretty much a non-issue now, and there are other more exciting and visible things to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, guess what happens as soon as we stop pushing on the boulder? You bet. That son of a gun starts rolling backward &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; slowly at first, then faster and faster and faster, then bounding and smashing its way down the mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s headed all the way down to the bottom, and the trip down is a whole lot quicker than the trip up. You have to be really brave or really dumb to get in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we ever stop pushing to keep maintenance proactive, we will be back down and dirty in the reactive mode before we know it&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;back down in the dark, cold, slimy, muddy gulch at the bottom, where all kinds of nasty, obnoxious creatures are hissing and snarling and biting at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now down here it takes way more resources, time, money, blood, sweat and tears just to get through (just to survive) the day. We were starting to have it made when we were at the top. Comparatively, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking that much to stay there, but we just didn&amp;rsquo;t realize what we had, and what it took to stay there. We took it for granted and we lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now we have to start over, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be tougher this time because now we have a serious credibility issue. Will we be like Sisyphus again this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Improve Equipment Effectiveness by Targeting 11 Major Losses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Everyone wants a silver bullet to address the competitive environment pressuring profits and, ultimately, jobs in North America. Having transitioned from a controls engineer to a maintenance manager to an operations manager, I can attest to the quest for that silver bullet. The reality is that few levers exist for you to pull that will radically improve the profitability of your organization. With global markets and price supports, commodity costs are generally fixed. The same applies to prices received for your company&amp;rsquo;s products or services. Labor markets and costs are somewhat fixed as well. With the exception of fuel surcharges, logistics costs are generally set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance or operations manager, your span of control is bound by the four walls of your site. With energy prices, some opportunities exist for cost reduction in pursuing energy audits and savings activities. The largest opportunity is focusing your efforts on improving equipment effectiveness by targeting the 11 major losses. In targeting these losses, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to return more than 400 percent and improve employee engagement in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 11 losses are divided into four major categories: planned shutdown, downtime, performance efficiency and quality losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned shutdown losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category is not often considered a loss, and it can be a hidden opportunity to produce product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 1 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost capacity due to production not being scheduled, equipment shut off for breaks, and shift changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The plant may only run Monday through Friday, leaving Saturday and Sunday available. In a three-shift operation, the third shift may be dedicated for maintenance. At one site, the operators in an area would shut down baggers as they went to break. Enforcing a break schedule to ensure every machine was covered during breaks solved the loss. In another area, the ability existed to automatically trend the bagger performance. Thirty minutes before every shift change, the bagger would be shut off to change the code dates. The baggers would not restart until the next shift came onto the floor and got the handoff from the previous shift. Bringing a heightened awareness by posting the trends solved this loss.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Capacity lost to planned maintenance. &lt;/strong&gt;Does it take an entire shift every day to do planned maintenance? Proper planning and scheduling procedures with audit and continuous improvement loops are utilized to address this loss. The maintenance supervisor should target 65 percent of his or her time on the floor ensuring the jobs are moving along and removing any obstacles. Take NASCAR as an example. In 1950, a pit stop took nearly four minutes. Today, the pit crew takes less than 20 seconds to put the car back on the track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Downtime losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes the following areas of loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 3 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The obvious equipment failures or breakdowns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re not tracking downtime or don&amp;rsquo;t believe the numbers, focus on the major events. To start, document the critical events that lose two hours or more. Create a simple root cause analysis form to track them. Empower a cross-functional team of maintenance and operations to determine the root cause and not blame. Action the findings to ensure the event never occurs again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 4 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The setup and changeover to change from one product or lot to another. &lt;/strong&gt;Empower your employees to develop new methods that reduce these times. In one area, reducing the time required for Clean In Place (CIP) cycles yielded the same cleaning levels but reduced the overall changeover time by more than one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 5 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time required to make the tool changes and part changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Tools like single-minute exchange of dies (SMED) break down these changeovers into single steps. In the changeover on a flow wrapping system, there were 247 steps identified, which required 2.5 hours to complete. After initiating SMED, the changeover was reduced to 15 steps and the time to 30 minutes. The approaches used in NASCAR are very similar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 6 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The startup and shutdown of equipment and processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop startup and shutdown sequences everyone must follow based on best practices from equipment operators. Create a chart that sequences every task on the startup or shutdown. Look for opportunities for parallel tasks. Empower a maintenance and operations team to reduce the amount of time required for each sequence. Determine the feasibility of automating all or portions of the events in the control system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Performance-efficiency losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes losses where equipment speed, output or capacity is not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 7 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment minor stops such as paper tearing out of wrapper or film not tracking correctly can add up over time.&lt;/strong&gt; These machine hiccups are not generally tracked but when totaled are amazing. Minor stops of six minutes each shift occurring over a three-shift, five-day operation add up to 75 hours lost in a 50-week year. Fix this to return almost 10 shifts of capacity for one machine alone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 8 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower output (productivity) from equipment that is operated at less than design speed or cycle times. &lt;/strong&gt;With age and wear, machines tend to run slower. A 10 percent loss is a common occurrence. Operators run the equipment slower, compensating in the belief of reducing the failures or minor stops. Lack of communications can play a role with this type of loss. Maintenance slowed a case packer until a repair was made. After the repair was complete, operators were running the equipment at the lower rate weeks later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Quality losses: &lt;/strong&gt;These losses make up the final category. Quality products can&amp;rsquo;t be made from poorly maintained equipment nor can quality be maintained from equipment that is consistently out of specification. If the equipment is running at design rate and is available on demand, yet it is not producing quality product, it&amp;rsquo;s just making waste at rate. Not only do you lose capacity and labor, you lose the material costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 9 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;The losses generated in waste or scrap is straightforward. It&amp;rsquo;s not just waste, it is lost capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 10 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Product that is defective or not saleable is a major loss. Even if it can be reworked or recycled, it costs valuable labor and capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 11 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Startups and shutdowns create yield or transition losses. During the startup or shutdown, quality product is not produced and is wasted. Solutions identified in Loss 6 above can be utilized to reduce the ramp-up or ramp-down losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with this knowledge, challenge yourself by walking around your site and determine where the opportunities for improvement are available. You might be surprised when flipping over the unturned stones. Stop these losses by developing a program of maintenance for your equipment to assure capacity. Require support from all groups involved with the daily use of the equipment and solicit input from employees at all levels within your company. Using these engaged employees, create a passion for performance and provide quantifiable results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Kitting Can Enhance Reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the world of manufacturing, we are looking for better, more efficient ways to improve our production uptime and quality, reduce the cost per unit, improve human capital utilization and create a higher quality of work life for our personnel. Kitting for maintenance crafts to perform their tasks is one of the easier and more effective ways to allow quality completion of the job with minimal productivity impact, especially when accompanied by a well-planned and functionally scheduled job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding the value of kitting in relation to the value of the time lost requires asking and honestly answering some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the job have to be done now or can it wait to be planned and scheduled at a time that minimizes production loss? Will we be able to schedule it at a time that will reduce the amount of product lost through the equipment downtime for the repair?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What materials should be kitted for the job(s)?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a value added to the front end work of kitting, controlling and delivering the kit for the job(s)? When will the materials folks know when to send the parts and to where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the job be planned well enough to identify and procure the materials necessary for a timely and quality repair?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will there be enough time to allow for the correct materials to be kitted and delivered, allowing the crafts persons to do the quality repair they want and need to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you can see, there are plenty of potential reasons/excuses for not kitting. All are invalid when kitting is accomplished with a bit of communication, cooperation and coordination. A well-managed materials inventory of the appropriate parts is an absolute necessity. That well-managed inventory will contribute to effective job planning and verification that those materials are the appropriate ones. The better the lead time of job scheduling, the better the planning of the job can be, along with the accurate materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What should be kitted? Do all planned work orders require a kit of the materials required? Should preventive maintenance work orders be kitted? Should lubrication route work orders be kitted? Is there a specific regimen for kitting work orders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planned work orders for outage, shutdown and turnaround work should, if at all possible, be kitted. This will allow the crafts persons to accomplish their tasking with the quality they desire, in the time frame budgeted by the appropriate management, allowing an on-time completion of the downtime scheduled. Planned work orders for backlog relief should be kitted, again to minimize the production downtime and allow the crafts persons the time to accomplish a quality, within-specification repair to support overall reliability. Preventive maintenance work orders that require repetitive replacement of items such as filters, lubricants, seals, and other expendable items identified for time-based replacement should also be kitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders that require technical troubleshooting that may encompass downtime should be kitted to the degree known. The troubleshooting requirement work orders must be accompanied in the job package by a comprehensive bill of materials that applies to that specific asset or entity, providing the crafts persons with up-to-date information about parts and materials availability in the storeroom. Not all work orders will clearly state the specific needs, therefore the need for troubleshooting by competent crafts persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders that are less complicated or that require items from expendable inventories in the maintenance shop or operating area may not require kitting, though if the work is recurring or programmed maintenance, it may be an easy task to schedule and kit the needed items on a routine basis. It is often easy for the experienced crafts person to be aware of the requirements of the job they are assigned to from the weekly schedule and gather materials from the applicable storage location on the way to the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accurate bills of materials for specific assets or entities allow the planner and crafts persons to proactively obtain the necessary materials for the job. A well-managed storeroom will have the asset or entity location of inventory items identified in that store&amp;rsquo;s stock number for each inventory item, along with the existing requirements anticipated through planned work. Should the unforeseen happen and there is a breakdown, the information for the necessary communication to the appropriate planner can be conveyed immediately. Parts reserved for planned work can be made available to the higher priority work, allowing a controlled replenishment of inventory and functional rescheduling of the lesser priority work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kit delivery is also important. Where and when should the kits for routine work orders be delivered? Where and when should the kits for outage, shutdown and turnaround work be delivered? When should those material items be charged to and issued against that specific asset or entity work order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is most effective to have kits for routine work, scheduled backlog relief work and scheduled preventive maintenance and programmed maintenance delivered the day before the date the work order is scheduled to the applicable drop zone or shop or equipment location. This gives the crafts person time to review the job with the supervisor (if applicable) and to verify that all the needed materials are present and correct. This final verification of materials is a very necessary task. It can be a very expensive disruption to take a system out of production without having the correct materials to accomplish the quality repair in the scheduled time frame. The result is a waste of operators&amp;rsquo; and crafts people&amp;rsquo;s time, production loss, sales and inventory loss and escalated tempers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance planner should ascertain the correct materials for the specific job. Communication with other knowledgeable people, such as qualified operators and experienced crafts people, will ensure the proper materials are identified for the job. The planner should verify the specific items required for the work order and review the kit for the job before the kit is issued. Then, when the kit is issued and delivered, the crafts person scheduled for the job should conduct the final verification. Should a discrepancy be found, there is time to avoid removing the system from service. The work can be rescheduled when all the necessary materials are present, alleviating unnecessary downtime and production loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kits may take the form of &amp;ldquo;crash carts&amp;rdquo; that are functional for planned and scheduled work of all sorts. The crash cart (or &amp;ldquo;rebuild cart&amp;rdquo;) is a container of all the materials that may be necessary to repair, rebuild or overhaul a specific asset. The crafts person takes what is necessary, then, after the job is complete and turned over to operations for production, inventories and commits the items used against the work order for the asset or entity repair, and returns the crash cart to the storeroom for replenishment for the next time it is needed. A kit may just be one bolt or a circuit card. However, it could also be a complete rotating assembly that is a repairable stores item to be issued as a replacement for the like rotating assembly in the field and the used, worn-out rotating assembly returned for rebuild in a planned and scheduled fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kitting for planned and scheduled work makes everyone&amp;rsquo;s life better. It enhances the reliability of the equipment through the quality repair effort, increases uptime and productivity of the equipment, creates less stress for the operator and allows smoother operation of the equipment. There is a good bit of effort required on the front end of setting up a kitting program, but once the program is set and monitored properly, life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Key Elements of a Well-planned Work Order</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There are basically five areas that if addressed properly will result in a well-planned work order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) The Right People &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; This focuses on the correct skills required for the scope of work as well as how many and how long (labor estimates) it will take to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) The Right Place &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; You should have an accurate identification of the process, equipment and location to reduce travel, investigation and setup times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) The Right Time &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;This should include windows of opportunity to gain access, along with operations&amp;rsquo; expectation of starting or completing the work. This will assist the scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) The Right Parts, Tools and Equipment &amp;ndash;&lt;/strong&gt; All repair parts should be identified, ordered and on-hand before scheduling. Arrangements are made for additional specialty tools and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) The Specifications, Permits, Hazards, Work Instructions and/or Appropriate Documentation &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; These should be included as part of any work package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If these five elements are addressed with sufficient detail, the opportunity for the work to be completed within the scheduled window with minimal delays and waits will be greatly increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>The Maintenance Supervisor Enigma </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/4/108310bc-d44d-4ac2-946c-3130635a60ab_supervisor-enigma.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;In my pre-retired life, I managed the development of maintenance procedures, PM programs, methods and service tools for all deployed equipment within the U.S. Postal Service. We also monitored our maintenance procedures manuals which incorporated support policies for the maintenance management information system. Any local changes were to be approved on a trial basis by my shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At that time, we were scratching our heads on how to get the supervisors out of their desks and out on the floor for more face time with the craft employees. I received a call from a plant maintenance manager requesting to stop recording the employees&amp;rsquo; work order time on the daily work schedule forms. This was accomplished at the end of each shift by the supervisors from completed work orders. Each supervisor spent about an hour on this clerical task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems the data entry to the MMIS is taken off the work order itself. The schedule sheet is only used for work assignments. He had devised a simple process to audit to assure accuracy. We gladly accepted his proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About two months later, he called and told me that his supervisors were still tied to their desks. Somehow they had found more administrative work to do. His further investigation indicated that his supervisors did not know what to do with the added floor time. He asked for help with this oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I will write several follow-on blog postings, prompted by this symptom, of a larger problem that we uncovered over the ensuing months, but I want to focus on the Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law that covers what happened here: The work will expand to fill the time allotted. An overall truism is that when you remove some repetitive work from a person&amp;rsquo;s day, you had better have something to replace it or the employee will find something to fill the void. This is a big issue with any changes in work design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It goes further when we consider that there is a ripple effect in any system when we make a change. We have to really understand how the system actually operates if we really want to manage for results. This is especially important when we are affecting a person&amp;rsquo;s work day. And over the years, seemingly small changes in many legacy systems have nurtured and matured work-around processes/methods, resulting in relying on individuals to perform that which the organization is responsible for: training and development. And I submit that the victim is usually the first-line supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The larger issue which we encountered was the abilities of our supervisors to supervise and even more telling was &amp;ldquo;what did we mean by supervise?&amp;rdquo; What does face time mean? How does a planned work order fit into the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s tool bag? How do we communicate change? What tools does the supervisor have? What are industrial best practices for supervisors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe we should start with the question: Why do we need supervisors? I am not an expert but will give actual examples of how some companies have addressed the question. They may include a plant with no management, face time as an interpersonal skill, learning organizations, &amp;ldquo;empowerment&amp;rdquo;, training and development, and hopefully some examples sent in by my faithful readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember: humility trumps pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/yv4lLrdpamM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Industrial Facilities and Processes: Are You Winning on Both Fronts?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Problem: &lt;/strong&gt;At peak production, a plant is turning out enough product to fill a 120,000-square-foot warehouse, but the existing 80,000-square-foot warehouse was built to meet the inventory requirement of the average production volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Facilities Solution: &lt;/strong&gt;Invest millions of dollars to expand the warehouse to 120,000 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what if there was a solution that required &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; capital investment and optimized both the facility &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the processes associated with it? In this case there is: a revised production and inventory changeover strategy that makes more effective use of working capital and existing space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Aha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven Team Decisions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective solutions such as this are more likely to be identified when all stakeholders collaborate in strategic master planning based on analysis of historic production and demand data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As in any profession, plant facilities and process managers become experts in their respective areas, engaging in independent planning that de-emphasizes the strong link that could exist between the two areas. The one-sided strategies that result, such as increasing warehouse space, often tie up capital in costly and inefficient solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When both sides of the house collaborate in strategic master planning, each member of the planning team must justify his or her functional needs and challenges to the rest of the team. As a result, everyone on the team, including the one justifying, then better understands the issues and challenges. And when the processes are driven by a solid analysis of historic production and demand data, the team is able to identify cost-effective strategic solutions that might well have eluded the individual facilities and process leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Closer Look at a Common Problem: Warehouse Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper into the problem outlined above: how much warehouse space does a plant really need? A common challenge in the manufacturing industries is finding the right balance between production scheduling and the amount of warehouse space for production input and output. More is not necessarily better. Excess warehouse space costs money, not only in terms of land, construction and ongoing O&amp;amp;M, but also in compromising the efficiency of the production processes. Also, working capital is non-value-added, so there is a lot of pressure on manufacturing today to make prudent capital investments or to change the processes enabling organizations to shrink inventory while continuing to serve the customer at the same or a higher standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Accounting for Variation in Production Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;The annual budgeting process usually is based on a projected average production volume, whereas the actual daily, weekly and monthly production volumes will vary considerably. Perhaps the management team has been planning to have available 80,000 square feet of warehouse space to meet 10 days of finished goods inventory to serve customers. In reality, only one-quarter of the total stock transitions in that time period, while three-quarters of the warehouse stock never transitions in the planned, timely manner. Instead, three-quarters of the stock is warehoused to provide a perceived extra margin to meet potential demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the average inventory strategy does not take into account the actual variation in production, and there is a much better way to plan for this. In our example, 80,000 square feet is the right-sized warehouse for an average production volume. However, the actual requirement ranges from 40,000 to 120,000 square feet based on variations in actual production volume throughout the year, according to an analysis of historic data over one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without spending a dollar on additional warehouse space, the inventory changeover and production strategy can be modified accordingly &amp;mdash; that is, increasing changeovers, adjusting shift and work-hour strategies, utilizing unique storage approaches to make the most of cube space, all of which reduce inventory during peak production, when the warehouse otherwise would have insufficient space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this solution, warehouse space relative to demand drives the inventory changeover and production strategy. This avoids the costly, inefficient alternative: building, operating and maintaining 120,000 square feet of warehouse space when it is not needed throughout the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing Customer Demand vs. Production Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An analysis of the data may show that customer demand is very different from production volume. This may not be apparent because of the differing focus on each side of the house. The plant is focused on volume and efficiency of production, while corporate management is focused on customer service, even though both sides agree on the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When they look at the data together, the team realizes that they can adjust their changeover and production strategy to reduce their excess inventory &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; provide better service for their customers&amp;rsquo; ever-changing demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Collaboration yields a win-win for facilities and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Identifying and Managing Pinch Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much of the capital investment in the production process is intended to relieve pinch points so that future production requirements can be met. In reality, pinch points tend to shift based on variations in product mix, batch or run sizes, routine maintenance activities (e.g., sanitation, preventive maintenance, etc.) and unplanned mechanical and electrical repairs. Understanding this moving target can enable the team to focus resources where they will have the most impact. For example, the team may be considering a capital investment in blending and/or packaging to relieve common pinch points. However, a more effective strategy may be to first change production scheduling to move the pinch point consistently to packaging, and then to use this new paradigm to focus capital investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/22/576213ff-d626-48c8-ac01-4059cc927d35_spaghetti-sketch-3.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 650px; height: 228px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This spaghetti diagram shows volume and flow of material. This example includes flow out of the facility.&amp;nbsp; Credit: SSOE Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Balancing Product Inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Returning to the warehouse space issue, suppose the warehouse is full, but the company needs a wide range of products to meet customer demand in January and February, and the current inventory of some products is too high, while other product inventory is too low to meet this demand. This will require a number of small production runs to balance the inventory, along with associated maintenance and changeover activities. As a result, the total number of production hours will drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here again, the team will need to consider alternative strategies &amp;mdash; for example, a capital investment in additional production capacity or improving the sanitation process to make more production hours available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Using Computer Modeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the master planning process, a computer model can be used to analyze literally hundreds of thousands of lines of historical data to show pinch points and other inefficiencies in the process, which may guide the team toward a different capital investment decision than they initially considered, or toward changes in production scheduling or processes to achieve the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planners also use the Lean Six Sigma strategy to analyze and improve the outcomes of management and operational processes. However, all analyses must be integrated with a real-world engineering solution that meets customer-service requirements without straining the plant&amp;rsquo;s profitability. A profitable balance of direct and indirect labor, realistic asset utilization, flexible space and inventory requirements are the important variables that must be optimized across varied customer demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing Multiple Plants/Sites as a Single System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because most manufacturing organizations are structured such that the plants operate relatively independently, often with a culture of friendly competition, the master planning process must optimize both individual site efficiency and the overall effectiveness of the system. If the planning process considers multiple sites as a system, it may be possible to foster a stronger team effort among plants that supply product to one another at the same time that they must compete in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using this approach, the planning team may be better able to identify the optimal place, timing or type of capital investments to optimize system effectiveness. In some cases, the team may decide that optimizing the system requires a reduction in the total number of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Sharing the Pain vs. the Single-system Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A current issue for large organizations with multiple sites that make different products using similar processes is how to respond to the market requirement to increase the range of products to make the same volume they made 10 years ago. A common philosophy is to &amp;ldquo;share the pain&amp;rdquo; of producing the challenging, low-volume products. These might include 20 to 30 low-volume dessert mix products or SKUs, or a mix of low-volume specialty products used only in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office with a near-constant, unchanging demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While sharing the pain is an equitable philosophy, the single-system approach to master planning may be able to help the team identify a more effective, profitable way to manage this issue. For example, it might be more efficient for one plant to specialize in the low-volume products. Perhaps one plant team will even seek to take on that challenge. This low-volume, high-product-mix plant can drive a unique production philosophy utilizing simplified processes, less automation, flexible staffing and creative inventory strategies that can respond to these production challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s another win-win for facilities and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining Product Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another current issue for corporations with flexible or seasonal variations in products is how to control and maintain product quality. For example, in the prepared food industry, owners and managers are using a system-wide approach to master planning to address the product quality process to improve food safety, in particular, prevention of microbial food contamination. Effective solutions can be identified through analysis of zones of contamination. In some cases, a solution may lie in rearranging the order of similar processes to avoid contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Remembering the Human Factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Strategic master planning must not forget the human element. Even heavily automated processes still have a connection with people and, unlike machines, their productivity comes from the elusive and harder-to-measure qualities of focus, health and engagement. Effective productivity planning remembers the workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of how people interact with machines was learned the hard way by the military in the 1900s, where the success was the difference between life and death. Other lessons were not as dramatic, but from those a whole new area of study began, known as human factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Design is Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key component of human factors influencing master planning is the concept of environmental design. The basic lessons are simple: focus is improved by controlling distractions, healthy environments promote productivity and timely rest promotes accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Scientific studies of individual performance as it relates to &amp;ldquo;human factors&amp;rdquo; have expanded our knowledge and understanding, but the results are not formulaic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, look at the body of work referenced and summarized by Dr. John Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and research consultant, in his book &lt;em&gt;Brain Rules&lt;/em&gt;. In it he provides his interpretation of the core learning from a large number of research projects and presents them in an easy-to-understand way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Others promoting the science of environmental design are finding the same things. The USGBC Research Program, which serves as a bridge between green building practices and applied research, connects us to a number of articles describing the health and productivity benefits realized by the occupants of green buildings. Such benefits include increased productivity resulting from improved indoor air quality, improved temperature control, high-performance lighting, lighting control, natural lighting and employee retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cornell University researcher Alan Hedges, professor of ergonomics, has found that workers&amp;rsquo; taking a break increases productivity and reduces repetitive stress injuries. The findings are diverse. Many of them relate to how people interact with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The good news is that in most countries, particularly the United States, environmental design forms a core part of an architect&amp;rsquo;s basic education. While having an architect as part of your master planning team is not an absolute, it is a great way to quickly tap into a wealth of environmental design factors to benefit your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Breaks Restore Concentration, Assuring Safety, Efficiency and Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The master planning team will consider that factory workers can remain fully engaged in the production line for only so long before they need to take a break to maintain a level of concentration that assures safety, efficiency and quality. Enhance these periods of disengagement from the machine by planning good environmental design that will allow the break to be as refreshing as possible. One element of that would be to have the break area in a location remote, but not too remote, from the workstation. A walk will stimulate oxygen and nutrients flowing to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, have the break environment be significantly different from the workspace. The machine space, even if it is ergonomically designed, is still foreign to the human body. Consider creating a break area at a scale different from the machine space &amp;mdash; at a more human scale. (Why do kids like to play in boxes? Scale.) Change the lighting, color, finish material textures and typical distance of focus to ease the eyes. Encourage the consumption of moderate amounts of healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effective Design Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With these ideas in mind,leading companies also use the master planning process to address cost-effective ways to create break rooms that are designed to recharge their workers mentally and emotionally, as well as physically. A typical break area is often nothing more than a few picnic tables set out on the plant floor; but, designed for large production-line equipment, the space is often 20 to 30 feet high and cavernous in its volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A more effective break room is designed as a human-scale space, with a lower ceiling, as well as non-task lighting and warmer colors and finishes. Ideally, this space has views of the outdoors (preferably landscaped or natural areas). However, if this is not possible, the design can incorporate cost-effective tubular skylights to bring natural light into the space. This type of space can recharge workers, making them more alert when they re-engage with the production equipment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is a significant value in the master planning process for the investment &amp;mdash; a high ROI in terms of optimizing facility capital through improved productivity and healthier employees. And organizations of virtually any size can benefit from guidance by consultants experienced in facilities and industrial processes. Both bring a level of objectivity, consistency and expertise &amp;mdash; sustainable over many years &amp;mdash; that may be difficult to achieve otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Working Together to Win on Both Fronts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those who have done it successfully know that working together yields &amp;ldquo;aha!&amp;rdquo; moments. When both sides of the house collaborate, digging deeply into a broad range of master planning issues, they can identify capital investment strategies that optimize both the facilities &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the processes, therefore winning on both fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/W_hOZh9wZc4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>U.S. Manufacturing Expanding Faster Than Forecast</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing expanded faster than forecast in April, driven by gains in exports and inventories that are keeping the industry at the forefront of the U.S. economic expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/institute-for-supply-management/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Institute for Supply Management&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s factory index fell to 60.4 last month from 61.2 in March, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion and the measure has exceeded 60 for four consecutive months, the best performance since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand from emerging economies like China, the need to replenish stockpiles and investment in new equipment may keep benefitting manufacturers, including &lt;a class="web_ticker" density="sparse" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CAT:US" ticker="CAT:US" title="Get Quote" topic_url="http://topics.bloomberg.com/caterpillar-inc/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="web_ticker" density="full" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=CMI:US" ticker="CMI:US" title="Get Quote" topic_url="http://topics.bloomberg.com/cummins-inc/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Cummins Inc. (CMI)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Federal Reserve policy makers last week said the expansion was &amp;ldquo;proceeding at a moderate pace,&amp;rdquo; buoyed by stronger business spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The overall manufacturing sector remains healthy,&amp;rdquo; said Robert Dye, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. The industry &amp;ldquo;is helping to sustain an ongoing economic expansion,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The median forecast of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a drop to 59.5. Estimates ranged from 57.5 to 62.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px"&gt;Construction Gain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another report showed construction spending rose more than forecast in March as companies put up factories and power plants, while home improvement outlays also rebounded. The 1.4 percent gain was the biggest since April 2010 and followed a revised 2.4 percent decrease in February that was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also today, results from a Federal Reserve survey showed banks made borrowing easier in the first quarter as they forecast the economy will improve. Looser standards for business loans reflected more competition among banks, while some financial institutions &amp;ldquo;also pointed to a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook,&amp;rdquo; the Fed said in its quarterly poll of senior loan officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a 0.4 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Stocks dropped, pulling the Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;rsquo;s 500 Index down from its highest level since June 2008, as a slump in commodity shares dimmed optimism spurred by the death of &lt;a density="sparse" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/osama-bin-laden/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The 500 Index fell 0.2 percent to 1,361.22 at the 4 p.m. close in &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;New York&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Treasuries were little changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px"&gt;Manufacturing Globally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	European manufacturing growth accelerated more than forecast in April, driven by higher production in Germany and &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/france/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;France&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a separate report showed. A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area rose to 58 from 57.5 in March, London- based &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/markit-economics/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Markit Economics&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said in an e-mailed report today. That&amp;rsquo;s above an initial estimate of 57.7 on April 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISM&amp;rsquo;s export index climbed 6 points in April to 62, and its inventory gauge rose to 53.6 from 47.4 in March. Measures of production, new orders and employment eased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;A lot of this growth in manufacturing is driven by export demand and the weaker dollar,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a density="sparse" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/norbert-ore/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Norbert Ore&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the ISM survey, said in a conference call from Atlanta. The ISM figures are showing no effect from supply-chain constraints linked to &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/japan/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Japan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s earthquake and tsunami in March, even as some automakers had &amp;ldquo;to make some changes&amp;rdquo; in production schedules due to the disaster, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The index of prices paid rose to 85.5 from 85. A measure of supplier deliveries decreased to 60.2 from 63.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px"&gt;Backlogs Building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The measure of orders waiting to be filled jumped to 61, matching an almost six-year high reached in February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest maker of construction equipment, posted first-quarter profit that topped analysts&amp;rsquo; estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast as sales surged in &lt;a density="sparse" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/china/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;China&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, India and &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/brazil/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Brazil&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/developing-countries/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;developing countries&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We expect that the pace of world economic growth will support continued recovery in the key industries we serve,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a density="full" href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/doug-oberhelman/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033cc"&gt;Doug Oberhelman&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief executive officer at Caterpillar, said in a statement last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand from countries like China and Brazil is spurring U.S. exports of machinery and consumer goods. Sales overseas reached the highest level on record in January before falling in February for the first time in six months, according to Commerce Department figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;

            <title>Are you (like many) planning to be reactive?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I was recently facilitating a &amp;quot;Maintenance and Reliability for Managers&amp;quot; four-part series course at a particular site when the subject of planning was raised by one of the supervisors attending. As part of the conversation, he commented &amp;ldquo;but gee, Jeff, I&amp;rsquo;m planning for my people now&amp;rdquo;. As it was Tuesday, I asked if he was planning for next week&amp;rsquo;s schedule or this week. His reply is like so many that I hear, &amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;m planning for this week, actually two days from now.&amp;rdquo; Mind you, his site has a planner scheduler. I went on to ask, if the supervisor was doing the planning, who was doing the supervision &amp;ndash; i.e. removing obstacles from jobs in progress, determining the development needs of the people, controlling time lost during and between jobs, etc. In the end, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t him. Turns out no one was performing that function. It begs the question, if the supervisor is doing the planning, what is the maintenance planner scheduler doing? That&amp;rsquo;s another story for a different day. The goal of maintenance planning and scheduling is to drive out the inefficiencies of what are typically an organization&amp;rsquo;s most expensive hourly resources &amp;ndash; the maintenance technicians. No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to make them work harder. We are trying to just help them work smarter by providing a level of organization to the chaos that normally accompanies a reactive world. While better than no planning, planning jobs for a day or two days away often doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us time to reduce costs associated with expedited freight or making everyone jump through hoops to accomplish the job. No doubt, there always will be jobs that need to be completed in two days (or tomorrow for that matter). Jobs that happen in this manner are still very reactive by nature. That&amp;rsquo;s not what we want in a proactive, reliability-centered environment. Ideally, we put this week&amp;rsquo;s schedule together last week, and all of the stakeholders agreed that the items listed were the ones that the organization wanted to accomplish. In establishing the schedule, we chose work based on our priority matrix (high to low) and on 100 percent of the available labor hours that we anticipated for this week. So, if the supervisor is planning and executing jobs in this week, that means we are breaking the schedule. &amp;ldquo;Can we break the schedule?&amp;rdquo; you ask. Sure, but that usually means that some other work that we placed on the schedule is not getting done, as we scheduled 100 percent of our available labor resources. When we break the schedule, we should ask the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assuming that we have the parts to do the work, are we breaking the schedule for work that is more important than the work on the schedule?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is it work that really could be planned and scheduled next week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another item that many supervisors don&amp;rsquo;t stop to consider is how doing work in the current week outside of the week&amp;rsquo;s schedule affects our metrics. Using the example of breaking the schedule gives a lower schedule compliance number if work that was scheduled during the week is not completed. Remember, schedule compliance is a measure of &amp;ldquo;did we do what we said we were going to do on the schedule?&amp;rdquo; If the work that didn&amp;rsquo;t get completed is a preventive maintenance / predictive maintenance activity, we get a double-ding when PM compliance is added to the mix. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s OK to break the schedule if business requirements demand it, but it&amp;rsquo;s not something to take lightly. What, you aren&amp;rsquo;t measuring your performance or key indicators? How do you know where you are going if you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you are? If you would like a listing of some key metrics you should be monitoring, send an e-mail to me at &lt;a href="mailto:jshiver@peopleandprocesses.com"&gt;jshiver@peopleandprocesses.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be happy to answer other questions about maintenance planning and scheduling as well. Just shoot me an e-mail or reply below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/4cNta7eLlOU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Do you know how much it costs to run that equipment?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Decisions have to be made&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to save energy, to save dollars. Having hard data on which to base those decisions removes the &amp;ldquo;guess factor&amp;rdquo; and ultimately has a positive effect on the bottom line. Can recording data, analyzing results, and then making intelligent decisions really have that large of a dollar effect, though? The answer is &amp;ldquo;Absolutely yes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparing 200-horsepower air compressors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Consider this manufacturing plant example. The facility owned two 200-horsepower air compressors used for supplying plant air. Since compressor number one was rated at slightly more capacity in cubic feet per minute (cfm) than compressor number two, the decision had been made many months before to run compressor number one as the main compressor, and use compressor number two as the &amp;ldquo;trim&amp;rdquo; compressor. Thus, the trim compressor would run only when compressor number one was not able to maintain system pressure. This sounds logical, especially since they are both the same horsepower&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; there should be little or no difference in electrical operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/17/quick/6873c717-9ef1-4124-b8e9-3b9821347d1c_trainco.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Data logger software automatically graphs the energy usage for a 200-horsepower air compressor. This quick overview shows the compressor is averaging just over 50&amp;nbsp;kilowatts of energy consumption during a three-day period of operation. Knowing the electrical rate charge of $/kWh, it would be easy to estimate the cost of operating this compressor during this period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Power loggers were installed on each unit for several days to determine the actual electrical energy operating cost. Each unit was run by itself to make sure its operation was not influenced by the other unit. Compressor number two was found to be significantly more energy efficient, and was also quite capable of supplying plant air needs. Compressor number two was a newer, more energy-efficient design than its counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility was being charged $0.07 per kilowatt hour (kWh). The run times and kilowatt energy usage were extracted from the logged data and the actual operating costs determined. Such calculations are relatively simple and can easily be built into a spreadsheet for plant-wide usage. The bottom line: Operating compressor number two as the primary plant air compressor resulted in an annual estimated savings of $29,510. Obviously, logged data proved to be much more accurate than &amp;ldquo;best guess&amp;rdquo; based solely on nameplate data. Installing power loggers and later downloading data into a PC for analysis takes only a few minutes. A small investment in this case for a large return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does it cost to run 50 grinders during lunch break?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	At another manufacturing plant the question was asked, &amp;ldquo;What is it costing to allow those 50 grinders to run during lunch break?&amp;rdquo; The logic for allowing grinders to run while not in use was that the grinders were relatively small loads as compared to much larger equipment, and the cutting oil would remain circulating throughout the grinder. And, since the grinder was effectively &amp;ldquo;idling&amp;rdquo; with no load, it just simply was not worth the effort to shut the grinder down for such short periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To verify the decision, a recording digital multimeter with an AC clamp was used to determine the actual operating cost of one grinder during the lunch break period. Interestingly enough, the savings came to only $0.55 for the one grinder. However, multiplying the 55&amp;nbsp;cents times 50 grinders yielded a lunch time savings of $27.50. Given the variables of shift work and holidays, the annual estimated savings of shutting off the grinders during the lunch periods came to just under $8,000. Once again, a 30-minute check revealed a significant savings that could be achieved by the push of only two buttons per grinder: one for &amp;ldquo;stop&amp;rdquo; before lunch and one for &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational costs for larger motors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Larger motors for various applications should always have their operational cost known. In one facility, a 100-horsepower (HP) motor was used to pump water from a holding pond several hundred feet to where the water was used for process cooling. The motor ran continuously during plant operations. Other options were being explored for cooling water. The question that needed to be answered to determine payback before a decision could be made was, &amp;ldquo;How much is it costing us to run the current pumping system we have?&amp;rdquo; By recording the kilowatts consumed by the motor and the number of hours it was operating during a plant cycle, it was determined the 100-horsepower motor was almost always operating at its full capacity of 100 HP. It was costing the company $33,241 annually. Business decisions were then made to replace the existing system with a more efficient motor and pump design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But, why not just rely on nameplate data to determine the cost to operate a motor? After all, NEMA motors are marked with required ratings including their horsepower and efficiency ratings. The answer is that motors rarely operate at their nameplate specifications. Expect actual operating costs to vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a 460-volt, three-phase, standard-efficiency 100 HP motor operating under full load for 8,760 hours per year will probably cost just over $48,000 per year to operate at an electric rate of $0.10 per kWh. But, what if the motor is not operating under full load at all times? Then, the total operating cost can drop significantly. The only way to know for sure is to measure and record data. Then, analyze data and determine the true dollar value that the motor is contributing to that utility bill. Depending on the application, such a motor may be a candidate for large energy savings with the use of a variable frequency drive (VFD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Data Logger information imported into a spreadsheet for analysis. This 100-horsepower centrifugal pump motor, if fully loaded, should be consuming nearly 80,000 watts (80 kW). The 32,000 watts (32 kW) indicates the motor is only partially loaded, operating inefficiently, and that it may be a candidate for a VFD&amp;mdash;which could result in significant energy savings. Readings averaged every 10 seconds over a one-minute period. Average watts consumed by the motor over the previous 10 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cost of lighting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lighting is one of the largest consumers of electrical energy in most industrial and commercial facilities. For example, annual lighting cost in a 160,000-square-foot industrial facility is approximately $85,030. Such dollar amounts can often be quickly and significantly reduced, if you know where to find the biggest savings. Many lighting options are available and selecting the right ones requires intelligent decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The question becomes, &amp;ldquo;What does it cost to keep those lights on?&amp;rdquo; Then, estimates can be made for newer, more efficient replacement systems using published data. You can make fairly accurate estimates by counting fixtures, identifying lamp wattages and types, taking into account ballast operation, and knowing actual hours of which lights are on when. However, for decision making purposes, quick and accurate data can be achieved with simple ac clamp meter readings on lighting circuits in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example, certain fluorescent lighting was left on at a commercial facility for extended periods with what was thought to be good justification. A common misconception is that it is more energy efficient to leave fluorescent lighting on than it is to turn it off. This is true only to a certain extent, as savings are attributed to avoiding the small amount of inrush current when starting these lamps. Also, excessive switching off and on, such as several times per day, can shorten lamp life. The U.S. Department of Energy general rule of thumb is that fluorescent lighting should be turned off if the room is left unoccupied for more than 15 minutes. However, in some areas of the country this number might be as low as five minutes if electrical rates are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is easy enough to use an AC clamp meter and measure the voltage and current supplied to a lighting circuit to quickly obtain accurate numbers. You can make a quick calculation for the cost to operate that lighting circuit. But what if you are assuming the lights are being shut off at certain times when, in fact, they are not? After all, you placed a sign reminding all workers to turn off all task lighting at workstations at the end of their shift. You probably will not be surprised that electrical current and kW do not go to zero on all such lighting circuits at the end of each day. So, how much are lights that someone forgot to turn off costing you? You won&amp;rsquo;t know until you measure it. Then put up signs showing workers the dollar amounts associated with lighting expenses and you are sure to create some interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The per-hour cost of running equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Sometimes operations and facility managers simply like to know how much it costs to run a specific piece of equipment per hour. Such information should be provided at 100 percent load, 90 percent load, 80 percent load, and so on. Information can then be extrapolated by managers to make operational decisions. &amp;ldquo;What if I run press No. 5 on this project instead of press No. 3? Which one allows me to make the same part for less?&amp;rdquo; A fair question that should have a concrete answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is easy to look at an electric utility bill and know what the charge is for the month. Managing and reducing that bill is the goal of energy management and requires the cooperation of all facility personnel. To make intelligent decisions you must know where that electrical energy is going each month. You must measure and record energy data on major pieces of electrical equipment and systems. Using a power logger for at least one plant cycle or more is best. Determine the hourly and annual costs to operate that equipment. Keep track of this data and have it readily available and know how much it cost to run your equipment. It is much more comfortable to make decisions based on fact rather than on estimates and best guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance technician, do you believe having responsibility for specific equipment is the best way to perform your job? By responsibility, I mean you are the only one that conducts preventive maintenance tasks and major repair work on that specific equipment. Do you believe it&amp;rsquo;s the right answer for the organization? As a maintenance manager, is this approach to equipment ownership the right answer for you or your stakeholder partners like operations? In all of my time in engineering and maintenance, this facet of maintenance has been a struggle for many maintenance organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I was part of a team that built a pet food facility in Columbia, S.C., a few years back, the maintenance organization was modeled after similar organizations in the company. There were two maintenance technicians that covered each of three shifts and rotated across those shifts. Ideally, one was mechanical and the other electrical. Then, there were five or six day-shift maintenance technicians that had system ownership. There was one technician for the receiving, grinding, extrusion, drying, packaging and controls areas. Each of these maintenance technicians decided the day&amp;rsquo;s priorities, performed the preventive maintenance, handled the longer-term strategic improvements and capital work. Obviously, they were the &amp;ldquo;go to&amp;rdquo; guys or system &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; for any issues or work in their areas. They truly owned the equipment and took pride in the work they did. From a technician perspective, it was great as they called the shots and the business benefited. If they needed help doing something, they might ask another system technician to lend a hand or they may write a work order for some contractor resources to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But this model is not always as rosy as it appears from a maintenance management perspective. Consider Fred who has been the extrusion system technician for six years. This area is not for the faint hearted as it has 300-horsepower motors and large equipment with complex support systems. Fred was working on his daughter&amp;rsquo;s car at home and injured his back. He&amp;rsquo;s going to be out for three months, at a minimum. Since Fred is the only one who works on it, no one else has any expertise. Now what do you do? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some other items. While a maintenance planner existed, the system technicians decided the priorities for their work. That was by individual system areas, not the overall factory needs. The thought was, &amp;ldquo;Just because it was a priority for one area didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it was a priority in my area.&amp;rdquo; So there was no real overarching priority matrix that was enforced. Trying to get people to work on equipment outside their areas was like pulling teeth at times. Some guys didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with the approaches and methodologies that other guys used in their areas; so consistency was a factor. So, rather than one cohesive factory, you ended up with six silos each marching to their own drummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen some organizations encourage ownership and try to overcome the expertise issue by using an approach called &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. If the technician learned a skill outside his normal work area, then the business would compensate the individual with additional pay per hour. It was a management responsibility to make sure the people used those &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. Often, that never happens on a frequent basis. So, time goes by, possibly years, and the technician &amp;ldquo;forgets&amp;rdquo; how to do the work. The increased pay did not stop, however, and one day the call comes to send the technician over to apply those &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. The maintenance technician isn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on the idea since its Fred&amp;rsquo;s area and they haven&amp;rsquo;t touched that equipment in three years. Up comes the safety flag and 10 reasons why they aren&amp;rsquo;t the right person for the job. Maybe they are right; you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, if management makes the technicians constantly rotate across the areas, you never build any expertise on any equipment &amp;ndash; and you don&amp;rsquo;t build any ownership, either. Many organizations face this struggle today. If the work gets complicated, they have to call the factory representative to come do the work, or it&amp;rsquo;s outsourced. If the equipment has been modified, the factory rep smiles and says, &amp;ldquo;Sorry, but that&amp;rsquo;s not our equipment.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not just skills related to production equipment, but consider someone with machinist skills inside maintenance organization. When the equipment is down and you need it, you generally need it now. Many shops don&amp;rsquo;t have mills or lathes anymore, not to mention the skilled people to run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of this is driven by how you align the maintenance organization as well (i.e. centralized or de-centralized). What&amp;rsquo;s a maintenance manager to do? How do you strike a balance between equipment ownership and building the skills through cross training, and having the ability to get the work done all the time? Is it based on the culture of the organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/izssm4W7rsM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tips on maintaining the maintenance spare parts database</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I often see groups really struggling with managing their spare parts data due to years of neglect and lack of ownership. On the initial CMMS implementation, the data may have been properly described with a noun/qualifier/qualifier approach for the short text description. As time passes, people move on and someone else takes over the database.&amp;nbsp;They may not receive training or understand the naming concepts. Soon, the users of the data can&amp;rsquo;t find the parts housed in the storeroom due to the way items have been named. The storeroom inventory value goes up, too, as parts become duplicated since no one could find the stocked item. So, how do you straighten this mess out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the number of items, it may be simpler to opt for a data-scrubbing exercise by a third party. Before I describe this process to you, let me prepare you for a little sticker stock on the cost. Expect to pay somewhere between $3.25 and $4.50 per SKU (stock-keeping unit), depending on the services rendered. So, 30,000 SKUs will run you roughly $100,000 to $135,000. If you were unsuspecting, you can pick yourself up off the floor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general terms, here is how the data-scrubbing process works. You provide a database listing of all of your SKU information &amp;ndash; like manufacturer, model number and short text description &amp;ndash; to the vendor. The vendor will already have a data dictionary that it has built over time with all of the parts it has scrubbed to date. This is usually a pretty comprehensive listing; but if you are in the railroad business as an example, the data dictionary listing for those parts may not be as extensive. The vendor will typically work with you to customize the data dictionary when required. The database of SKUs that you provided is then compared against the data dictionary. You end up with direct matches, close associations and complete exceptions. The close associations require another pass from a human to verify and correct as required. They may require field inspection. The exceptions do require field inspection to address and correctly describe. As an example, a short text description of &amp;ldquo;Item 2 from Drawing 234563-2&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it. Can you tell me what part that is; is it a shaft, or a spindle? For what piece of equipment? It might be an SKF 6207-2RS1 bearing, but how would you know from a description like that? So, there is an on-site component to the data-scrubbing effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once this effort is complete, the vendor provides you a database that is loaded back into the CMMS. You can ask the vendor to identify duplicates for you. In addition, it can provide a more comprehensive inventory analysis, if needed, based on (for instance) stocking levels and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, the real priority for you is to put processes in place and audit to ensure you never end up in this situation again. You need to do this before you load the scrubbed data. That means that you really need a gatekeeper or two trained in creating the short description text as an example. After all, you just spent $135,000 of the business&amp;rsquo; money to scrub this data. But wait, you are not done yet. Now you should be looking at the storeroom inventory to rid yourself of the duplicates, if not already done so, and optimizing the items stored. This means (for example) determining the need to stock, at what quantities, and what reorder points.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lean shutdowns: 10 ways to cut fat and do the right thing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For most companies that run continuously, shutdowns and outages consume a lion&amp;rsquo;s share of both the maintenance and capital budgets. By its very nature, the shutdown is fat. The reason for this is the skewed balance between the cost of downtime and the costs of shutdown resources. In some cases, the costs of having extra resources (such as extra cranes) are dwarfed by the avoided cost of downtime. Shutdowns are also fat because the attitude is &amp;ldquo;Get &amp;lsquo;er done and we&amp;rsquo;ll worry about the budget when it&amp;rsquo;s over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Times have changed. This old approach to shutdowns is taken too far and, in itself, becomes a fat. It is certainly a fat approach now when times are tough and prices and demand soften. The fact that the downtime is more expensive than resources under any economic condition doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify the waste of resources.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There is a looming danger. The economy is in flux and many of our organizations are financially stressed. All parts of the company come under scrutiny for budget cuts. As a result, we are running our shutdowns under tremendous pressure. The temptation to cut corners on safety or environmental issues is strong.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Usually, the temptation to cut corners is not about present activities. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine skimping on fall protection harnesses or safety glasses. I can imagine and have seen companies apply temporary fixes rather than replacing pipes and design plants that are less expensive to build, but more expensive to operate.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Small improvements in managing shutdowns can yield significant weight loss for the maintenance department. The key is to cut the waste without compromising safety or environmental compliance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on my experience with shutdowns in oil, utilities, mining and primary metal industries, here are 10 concrete ideas to implement that will lean up the shutdown event without compromising safety or environmental security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1) Discoverables are a key source of fat. Discoverables are jobs that are &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; after the shutdown starts (when you start opening things up.) Some ideas to reduce the surprises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Open everything on day one.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep a history based on previous experience. Such a history will be important because it will show the deterioration in efficiency, if any.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Diagnostic technology (including predictive maintenance techniques such as infrared, vibration analysis, etc.) might give an indication of what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Schedule non-destructive texting (such as X-ray) right before you close the work list.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One option for reducing discoverables is to conduct a &amp;ldquo;pre-shutdown.&amp;rdquo; Maintenance workers on an oil platform out in the Gulf of Thailand do a mini-shutdown before they do their big shutdown. When they do the mini-shutdown, they open everything up; inspect it, close it up and go back into service. Now that&amp;rsquo;s not possible in a lot of places, but in this situation the crew said that their shutdowns were relatively controlled and didn&amp;rsquo;t produce a lot of surprises. The amount of discoverables was dramatically lower, but the crew still had to convince management. Could you imagine this, &amp;ldquo;Well, we want to do two shutdowns instead of one? You know, in order to manage the one, we&amp;rsquo;re going to do another one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Another Asian group did a dry run. A pharmaceutical company hired a contractor to do a complete dry run before the main shutdown. They acted everything out before they touched the equipment. The company paid for it, but when that shutdown started, it was like a choreographed dance troupe rather than a keystone cops episode.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The same company hired the shutdown contractor to draw up and start to plan the next shutdown while they were doing the dry run. With all the equipment opened up, the contractor could make measurements, do sampling and testing, and even count gear teeth to get a jump on the next shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Bad meetings are fat. Yet good meetings are essential to the success of the entire shutdown effort and are lean. Wasted meeting time is highly leveraged. If there are eight people at a meeting and they are waiting for the ninth, then the time of all eight people is wasted. The lean project here might be to train people in better meeting practices to make the meetings more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A lot of companies have very bad meeting habits. People come in late, or don&amp;rsquo;t do their homework. They do not pay attention and then act inconsistently with the decisions of the group. They don&amp;rsquo;t have good discipline around meetings, and management often doesn&amp;rsquo;t model good meeting behavior either. Start sending people to the more popular classes in how to run meetings and &amp;ldquo;take on&amp;rdquo; improving your meeting sophistication. By the way, do you have rules about texting or checking e-mail during meetings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3) If there are more than 25 tasks in the shutdown (a very small event), then using project management software will lean up the shutdown by shortening the duration. Be sure the planners and schedulers are well trained in the project management body of knowledge (called PM BOK), including familiarity with whatever software package you use. The advantages are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By calculating the critical path you know early on if the project is on or off schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By knowing the tasks that are on or near the critical path you know what to focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can anticipate if extra intervention is required to prevent the whole project from being delayed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can see a problem coming when it is small enough to fix easily.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can create displays that explain the shutdown and show its current status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4) Eighty-five percentof the planning and scheduling work is done before the shutdown begins. The point of planning is to identify the elements of a particular, unique job. The main point of scheduling is bringing together in precise timing the 11 elements of a unique specific maintenance job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Person(s) who are physically able and mentally alert with the right skill(s) to perform the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safe job steps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correct parts, materials, supplies, consumables for the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correct tools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Adequate equipment for lifting, bending, drilling, welding, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Personal protective equipment (PPE)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper permits and lockouts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Custody and control of the asset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safe access to assets, safe work platforms, and humane working conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Up to date drawings and wiring diagrams and other information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper waste disposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure you take advantage of the time before the shutdown starts to line up these 11 elements. Remember, if any item is missing, the job will stop or people will improvise (which increases the probability of a problem with quality and safety).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5) Keep an eye on over-ordering of materials and return unused inventory as soon as you know you won&amp;rsquo;t use it. When the shutdown is complete, the tendency is to shove all the extra material into the storeroom and take a credit for the value. That helps the shutdown budget but there is an overall cost to the organization unless the material is used in a fairly short time. Many storerooms have leftovers from projects and shutdowns for years after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6) Note explicitly whether there are enough supplies for the entire shutdown (the planner should put their hands on these items and not accept the computer&amp;rsquo;s inventory level). Supplies include rags, oil-dry compound, welding rod or wire, gases, nuts and bolts, etc. Shutdowns have been stopped in their tracks because someone made an assumption about the availability of simple resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7) Keep an eye on excessive numbers of rented cranes, welding units, generators, compressors, tanks, scaffolding, and other equipment. Investigate and return what is clearly not needed and doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any benefit, unless it is there to provide insurance against some significant loss. Return rentals of all kinds as soon as practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8) Be on the lookout for situations where resources are being paid for but are not being used. Have some lean projects to use them. This would also include spending a little extra to leave scaffolding to do some routine maintenance after the shutdown or keeping cranes for a few extra days as well as labor during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9) Validate the work list and remove duplications. Remove jobs that are not essential and be sure the wording of the work requested is clear. On individual jobs, look at the scope of work as a contractor would. Be sure it&amp;rsquo;s as clear and complete as possible. A better scope will result in lower prices if there are fewer unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10) Settle claims with any contractors promptly to avoid additional fees and penalties. Reducing the fat in your shutdowns can provide large payoffs for your plant in both time and money. Implementing any of the above 10 ideas can put you on the road to leaner shutdowns. Remember, small improvements yield large results.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Rethinking how strategic planning gets done</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;How business leaders evaluate the landscape, make sense of the environment, proactively shape the opportunities they see and then decide on which course of action to take &amp;ndash; in other words, Strategic Planning &amp;ndash; deserves far closer attention than it has received so far.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;There is a strong argument to be made for a more balanced approach &amp;ndash; which has proven to produce superior results over time. The dilemma for most executives, of course, is in finding a balance that will produce the economic benefits they seek in a timeline beneficial to their careers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploration rather than exploitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Our company has studied the growth policies and strategic practices of some of the largest organizations in North America and we have come to believe that success is best achieved when core strategies are framed by a mindset of &amp;ldquo;exploration&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;exploitation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;A strategy based on exploiting a particular product, market segment, customer group or type of technology, etc., we believe, is, I believe, fatally flawed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;One fuelled by curiosity and discovery, however, will produce a higher rate of opportunity creation than will ever be possible through exploitation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;It has been said that strategy is art and execution is science. Unfortunately, in most organizations, the creeping tentacles of &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; soon overtake the entire process. Once again, it is an example of balance being destroyed by extreme over-compensation.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;To put a not so subtle point on it, you simply cannot plan for what you do not know, and what you do not know is a whole heck of a lot more than what you do know. You can&amp;rsquo;t improve the outcome by working harder to put things into even tighter, smaller, more organized boxes and over-analysing possible outcomes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Fortunately, such a traditional Strategic Planning process may have run its course. If this is true, we need to shift the balance back towards an approach that is more appropriate to the conditions and circumstances we face.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Great strategy comes from great thinking &amp;ndash; not more planning. So far, organizations have actually been short-changing their future while only creating an illusion of being in control, which is not possible. The more balanced and sensible thing to do is to put the majority of our effort, both physical and cerebral, into improving the Strategic Thinking process, not trying to lock down the perfect Strategic Plan that, at the end of the day, will only be as good as the thinking that goes into it anyway.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;It was almost twenty years ago that Andy Grove of Intel wrote a controversial, but popular, book entitled &lt;em&gt;Only the Paranoid Survive&lt;/em&gt;. In the book he coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;strategic inflection points&amp;rdquo; to explain how successful leaders seem to have a certain sense of timing and a knack for being able to spot just the right moment to shift position.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;In fact, what Grove was talking about was the willingness and courage a leader needed to know exactly when to move on, when to leave things behind and when to take a bold step forward. Grove knew the advantage created when a leader has the confidence to shift to a new frontier right at the apex of success, rather than ride the downward curve of diminishing influence, profitability and relevance. In more recent times, Steve Jobs at Apple has taken this approach to new and braver heights and, in so doing, has become the poster boy for serial exploration.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;These leaders understand the benefits of exploration and the limits of exploitation. They know that &lt;em&gt;planning&lt;/em&gt; for an unpredictable future can only ever be the second best approach to building an organization that constantly improves its ability to &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; the future.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;In their recent book &lt;em&gt;Deep Smarts&lt;/em&gt;, Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap filled in a bit more of the emerging puzzle as to why some leaders and organizations outperform others in making choices and strategic decisions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just common sense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s just common sense but the idea that a person&amp;rsquo;s strategic thinking ability is enhanced by the &amp;ldquo;experience repertoire&amp;rdquo; they bring with them was a revelation in clarity. It suggests that the greater the variety of experiences (not just work experience) a leader has is directly linked to the quality of the insight and thinking they bring to the table.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;But if improved strategic thinking ability is the key lever to unlocking an organization&amp;rsquo;s business performance potential and if a leader&amp;rsquo;s experience repertoire enhances that ability and sharpens it to a fine point, there must be a certain set of smarts that allow it to be activated. An intellectual catalyst, if you like.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;One of the things that sets the accomplished Strategic Thinker apart from the rest of us is the ability to gauge the sometimes subtle shifts in context and meaning that are the precursor to change and, therefore, emerging opportunity. This, in turn, helps the leader create the vivid image of the future that is necessary to galvanize change, overcome hurdles and shift an organization onto a new path.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Many years ago, in a different life, but in a similar period of economic turmoil (Britain during the late 1970&amp;rsquo;s), I became exposed to Royal Dutch Shell and its strong belief in the benefits of Scenario Planning as a means to guide strategic decision making. I remember being struck by how much sense it made to envisage multiple futures rather than just one and then think deeply about each in order to prepare for different eventualities. As it turns out, the good folks at Shell were way ahead of their time and have been using strategic thinking techniques since the mid 1960&amp;rsquo;s. They would argue it has been a major factor in helping them weather the vagaries and risks of the global energy markets.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shift in the pendulum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Scenario Planning is both a process and a mental model. It is founded on a belief there simply is no certainty and, therefore, no possible way of predicting outcomes in the future. However, by having the rigour or discipline to pursue multiple possibilities at the same time, to hold multiple futures in your mind simultaneously, you achieve perspectives or clues that would otherwise be missed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;It is time for a major shift in the way leaders and their organizations go about the process of creating their business strategy. This will require a new set of tools, techniques, practices and mindsets that are better suited to the world we live in &amp;ndash; rather than the one we thought we had before we were so rudely and dramatically inconvenienced by the shock to our system.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Truth be told, if we had practiced more of what I have tried to argue for here, we would not have been so surprised and, perhaps, would have actually seen the inevitability of the need for a shift in the pendulum, before it was too late.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Strategies to optimize shutdowns, turnarounds and outages</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The traditional view of operational shutdowns, turnarounds and outages (STOs) holds that they are maintenance and engineering events. This simplistic view is held by many organizations. A more realistic and holistic perspective, however, recognizes that the impact and scope of STOs extend far beyond the maintenance and engineering functions. STOs can command significant capital and operating budgets. They attract the attention of shareholders and boards of directors, and impact inventory supply chains and customer relationships. They are, therefore, &amp;ldquo;whole business events&amp;rdquo;, not simple function-specific ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Considering all the potential ramifications, well-executed STOs can represent a source of competitive advantage for an organization. They can drive commercial performance, boost morale, bring recognition to high-performing teams and accelerate individual careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The corollary to this picture of success, of course, is that poorly executed STOs can cost an organization millions of dollars in lost revenue, drive up operating costs and cause permanent damage to the careers of those involved. This has long been true but is now amplified in the current operational environment, in which most organizations are operating with reduced workforces and resources. Simply put: In today&amp;rsquo;s leaner and meaner business environments, STOs represent not only an increasingly significant challenge, but also an increasingly significant opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STOs consist of the following phases of activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detailed planning and organization of the work involved&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removal of assets from production&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspection and work execution, product changes, repairs, improvement activities or a combination of these&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Restart of the asset/unit/plant and restoration to &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; performance levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STO work is usually &amp;ndash; but not always &amp;ndash; recurring or cyclic in nature. An STO is unique in that it &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;involves the plant, unit or asset being taken offline or out of service. An STO is not considered to be complete when the individual work packages are completed. An STO is complete only when the asset, unit or item is returned to service and performing at the desired level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STOs are more complex than other project-based events. Quite simply, they involve both planned activities and unplanned work resulting from inspection of part of a machine or asset which is not accessible or visible during normal operations. The potential for identifying previously unforeseen or emergent work requirements discovered at inspection that must be performed within the defined time constraints of the STO adds the requirement of rapid troubleshooting and decision-making capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a moment to consider your organization&amp;rsquo;s current approach to conducting STOs. Is there a significant reliance on knowledge and experience? Are one or two team members considered critical to STOs because &amp;ldquo;they were there the last four times and know what happened&amp;rdquo;? All too often, the execution of a STO (with all the dependencies and ramifications we considered at the outset of this article) rides on one or two highly experienced &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; employees stepping up to solve the problem or &amp;ldquo;get it done&amp;rdquo; during STOs. But given the demographic shift that is now upon us, many of these individuals are destined to leave the workforce in a relatively short time. This, of course, is in addition to the everyday issues of absence due to sickness, transfers to another part of the business, or career advancement with another company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the knowledge and experience previously relied upon are no longer available for any reason, all the business issues which depend on the STO are in jeopardy. The challenge and opportunity then is to adopt a replicable, reliable, process-driven approach to STO management which harnesses &amp;ndash; but is not totally dependent upon &amp;ndash; team members&amp;rsquo; knowledge and experience, and enables easy knowledge transfer from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Kepner-Tregoe&amp;rsquo;s experience, the top challenges in managing STOs lie in the following critical areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Ensuring workforce safety, whether they are employees or contractors, is the No. 1 priority for the STO management team. &lt;/strong&gt;STOs present numerous challenges for safety. Large numbers of contractors may be working on site for the first time with little knowledge of equipment and processes. Employees will carry out many tasks which are not routine and only occur in the STO situations. For example, cleaning, inspection and repair will often be carried out with special isolation requirements in confined spaces or other challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) The development, deployment and communication of an effective STO process &lt;/strong&gt;which is clearly understood by all stakeholders, and which navigates all concerned parts of the organization through the complex challenges presented. Too frequently, the STO process is unclear, fragmented and not shared. Without a guiding framework, the coordination and execution of the complex tasks involved become extremely difficult. Many departments may need to plan inventory or resources if they are to be impacted in any way by the STO. A lack of general coordination is also compounded when the absence of a common approach results in a myriad of different methods being used, making coordination and communication close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Managing project scope creep is typically one of the top challenges for most STO management teams. &lt;/strong&gt;It is a particular issue in STOs where inspection is only possible when the process or asset is the STO (e.g. opening up a furnace to establish the amount of relining required). Managers need prioritization tools to help them make better decisions on managing emerging work to stay within plan and budget targets. Without such prioritization tools, STOs can quickly experience scope creep, leading to other work cuts from schedules which can have detrimental effects on operational performance after recommissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) The capture, analysis and availability of relevant information and metrics &lt;/strong&gt;via management information systems will enable the appropriate managing of activities and identification of future improvements. Measuring the right things, the right way, at the right time &amp;ndash; and communicating them appropriately &amp;ndash; allows STO leadership to maintain control of the diverse range of activities when work is being executed. While poor planning is usually blamed for cost and time overruns, if problems continue in future STOs, they are very often symptomatic of the absence of a good measurement and control system. This absence will either hinder &amp;ndash; or totally prevent &amp;ndash; the organization from understanding and learning from the problems it experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) The existence of business processes which do not support the needs of the STO. &lt;/strong&gt;We know from experience that organizations should continually evaluate (and, if necessary, adjust and align) their business processes in order to remain competitive, and that misaligned processes will cause inefficiencies. In most organizations, business processes are designed to enable normal day-to-day activities. They are generally not designed to cope with major peak loads, special cause events and the other unusual demands that an STO places on them. A key opportunity for improvement in STO effectiveness lies in re-engineering basic business processes so that they can accommodate the needs of an STO and its related potential emergent work requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Cost management and control in executing complex STOs. &lt;/strong&gt;The existing reporting and control systems do not provide STO budget performance data until sometime after the STO is completed. The STO requires a cost monitoring program that provides timely data throughout the STO, enabling those controlling activities to make more informed choices on course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) The coordination and management of complex resources. &lt;/strong&gt;STOs &amp;ndash; and particularly larger ones &amp;ndash; typically involve technical staff, corporate engineering, specialists, vendors, contractors, government bodies (safety, environmental, etc.) alongside internal employees, whom possess varying degrees of knowledge and experience. It is not uncommon in some operational environments for the number of people on site to grow by 300 percent when contractor resources are used to assist with STO execution. This puts a significant load on processes such as induction, isolation training, material supply and equipment procurement. Even if the internal team is generally experienced, an STO still can involve individuals in roles and carrying out key duties which are new to them. Without clear communication and management protocols, our experience has shown that up to 30 percent of the working day can be lost waiting for adequate instruction or searching for a resolution when a problem occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8) Transforming an organization from reactive to proactive. &lt;/strong&gt;Shedding a reactive culture and moving toward anticipating and resolving issues before they impact is also critical to STO success. Every organization has a hero or two &amp;ndash; people who are remembered for &amp;ldquo;saving the day&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and the individual&amp;rsquo;s reward for this kind of heroism can be great on many levels (job security, advancement, financial incentives, recognition, self-actualization). The problem is that heroism is only required when the organization is already in trouble. How many personnel are rewarded and recognized for the arguably more valuable heroism of thinking about and preventing things from going wrong? This is perhaps the most essential component in executing a successful STO. The few most efficient organizations we know already have replaced the &amp;ldquo;go and do it&amp;rdquo; mantra with that of &amp;ldquo;go and think it through properly first&amp;rdquo;, and have appropriately adapted their emphasis in terms of performance and recognition systems to encourage this type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9) Managing the expectations of diverse stakeholders. &lt;/strong&gt;As noted previously, STOs are more business issues than engineering events; yet, in many organizations, indirect stakeholders are rarely involved in the outage management process. However, one thing is certain, their voices will certainly be heard if restart is problematic, or if supply to market becomes an issue. A key skill requirement, and often a skill gap for todays STO leaders, is the engagement of key stakeholder groups early in the planning process. This enables adequate communication of the likely risks and consequences of the STO and keeps all impacted personnel informed during execution so they can plan their own areas of operation accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimizing the STO Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	STO optimization requires a holistic approach to managing the entire set of complex activities and relationships which exist in the shutdown-turnaround-outage (STO) process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To do this, several elements should be considered. First, a clear and common process framework must exist for the STO activity. Secondly, the processes that drive the flow of information and activities within the STO framework must be aligned and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are three primary phases that exist within a typical STO model. They are outlined in Figure 1 with sub-elements within each phase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/df1eb364-30b7-4780-ac87-11459d1f02a8_KT_STO_1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/6c217409-e3ed-4e31-acd7-77414c798ff6_KT_STO_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definition &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Definition Phase ensures the identification of major sponsors and customers at the initiation of the STO. It also provides communication channels for the business, business units and support functions to prepare the organization for the STO. The most suitable timeframe for the STO is determined by gathering data on the operational process, customer requirements, equipment needs, resources and other constraints. Once this information is processed, the Definition Phase drives decision-making activities in the &amp;ldquo;charter and scope&amp;rdquo; elements of the STO, where detailed objectives and boundaries for activity are defined. It should address the protocols for scope freeze and change control to ensure they are supported by the organization. Without such protocols, achievement of time and cost goals is practically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Definition Phase leads the team through the detailed processes of defining work activities, determining work packages and the resource requirements needed to carry out the work and performing primary risk assessment activities. It also should consider defining work in areas of STO tasks such as the decommissioning or removal of the asset from production. This can have a major impact on restart effectiveness and hamper the organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to synchronize restart with activities in other critical areas. The restart process itself is an area often underplanned and underassessed by STO teams, which in turn leads to poor production efficiency for extended time periods after units are returned to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On completion of the definition phase, the leadership team will have the first indications if the goals and objectives set for the STO are attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Planning Phase is primarily concerned with the organization of the STO activity. Key activities take place to ensure resources are available to execute the work packages that make up the STO activities. Responsibility assignment should consider adequate levels of knowledge, skills and experience of assigned resource bottlenecks where people, but not required skills, are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, tasks can be sequenced and scheduled to confirm the viability of the STO duration, and if the resources identified are adequate to complete the work identified within cost constraints placed on the STO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning activity also focuses the organization on two critical but frequently understated aspects of the STO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		aligning business processes to facilitate STO implementation, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		developing metrics and measurement systems to track a balanced set of indicators to drive future improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All organizations have business processes guiding the daily operational activities. The organization may not be completely satisfied with such processes, but they do for the most part exist. The issue for the STO is that the operational processes that are in place often times are incapable of dealing with the incremental load placed upon them by key STO activity, such as induction, contractor management, procurement vendor payment, cost control and reporting to highlight a critical few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The STO team must carry out a process review to establish the robustness of key business processes. If necessary, redesign and additions should take place so that the processes enable a more effective STO. Often, if this action is not taken, upon post-STO review, it is discovered that these same processes have negatively impacted the STOs implementation phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metric and measurement systems are a component that also must be addressed. These key systems are the providers of information for management decision making, control, and the identification of areas for both recognition and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metrics are an area that are often underexploited in the STO. Generally, most outage metrics are limited to the single dimension of performance covering time, cost and the achievement of overall STO objectives. While these are clearly the fundamental success factors, other important types of metric &amp;ldquo;families&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; process, people, promotional and political which may benefit the team and activity &amp;ndash; are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However well selected the metrics, to be of value, they must be monitored by an effective measurement system that has the appropriate frequency and has clearly understood protocols for escalation and feedback. Good metrics are often devalued, if not nullified, by the inadequacies of the measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to the commencement of STO implementation, a final round of risk assessment should be conducted on the interfaces between groups. This step ensures that planning and risk assessments done at a functional level can form part of an integrated STO plan. The process considers interfaces for master schedules, resource leveling, resource conflict, responsibility assignments, communications and issue escalation. At the same time, all pre-STO work is checked for completion so that there are no surprises when the Implementation Phase begins. As the STO progresses, any emergent work will consume precious time and resources. These up-front risk assessments pay dividends in the long run by keeping emergent work to an absolute minimum. Tactical modifications of the plan &amp;ldquo;on-the-fly&amp;rdquo; will, of course, be necessary to ensure on-time finish, but can be minimized with adequate focus and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	However efficient the design and flow of the Implementation Phase, its ultimate effectiveness is dependent on the outcomes of the Definition and Planning Phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Implementation Phase provides a process to ensure the work that has been organized gets done. It is specifically concerned with the mobilization and management of resources and the monitoring of activities to ensure that they accomplish STO results to the standards required in a safe and proper manner. The Implementation Phase establishes the standards of behavior required to deliver the STO objectives. On a daily basis, teams must communicate, resolve issues, and provide updates among themselves and the management team. The visual representation of the performance, schedule and cost allows close tracking on the progress of the STO, as well as the surfacing of additional issues. This will help to ensure that the information needed for effective problem solving, issue escalation and decision making is available, where required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As STO work packages are completed, and the asset or plant nears reinstatement to operational status, modifications to the restart plan based on lessons learned from emergent work should drive a review of the plans. Risk assessment also needs to be conducted on any modifications before attempting to restart the plant so that potential problems are adequately addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key element in the Implementation Phase is the close monitoring and reporting of the restart activity itself &amp;ndash; and this is vital to the timely resumption of operations. Formal equipment acceptance and handover from external vendors and the STO team must be carried out to make sure potential problems are addressed and desired value is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the restart has been completed, the team inputs the required data into the communication value stream to ensure learning capture and subsequent continuous improvement. The STO team then can be released for redeployment to its next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tie That Binds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Our experience has taught us that the model described is extremely robust. That same experience also has taught us that to be effective as a holistic approach, connectivity &amp;ndash; linking the critical elements in each of the three primary areas &amp;ndash; must be present through the design and implementation of a communication stream which flows through the model. Without such a communication stream, the organization runs the risk of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		having a tendency to look at the optimization of each component block rather than the process as a whole;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		overlooking the complexity of interconnections between the components that can lead to gaps or white spaces in process or organization; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		having different module responsibilities and ownership, leading to inconsistencies in standards in the implementation of the STO process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of the communication stream provides constant information feedback loops among the key elements of the STO process model, and also facilitates closeout and review activities to gather and process information on lessons learned. The communication stream ensures that information flows effectively for the duration of the STO. Stakeholders and performance objectives will require metrics and measurement systems which ensure that implementation activities remain on track to deliver the goals required of the STO. These monitoring frameworks will use dashboards and other visual aids to create visibility for all stakeholder groups, and will promote active communication and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At closure, the objectives and deliverables for the STO are reviewed to determine whether performance and stakeholder expectations have been met. Lessons learned from all STO stakeholders, including contractors and vendors, are documented and codified for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What type of results has been seen using KT&amp;rsquo;s approach to STO management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Development, deployment and communication of an effective STO process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Having a defined process that STO stakeholders and the STO team understand &amp;ndash; and can follow &amp;ndash; minimizes the issues that organizations often experience at restart once STO work packages have been completed. The graph for Changeover Performance below shows how an international display manufacturer improved its restarts over a number of the STOs simply by using a visible process. There was a 318 percent improvement in output for the first 24 hours of production at restart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Changeover Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Capture, analysis and availability of relevant information and metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the highly time-constrained world of an STO, having accurate and up-to-date information is key to making the right decisions. A dashboard that was used at a long products steel mill displayed metrics on progress among various teams, overall progress, costs, safety audits, extra work and other indicators. When the daily dashboard was distributed to stakeholders, it enabled sponsors, STO managers and team leaders to stay in close touch with the progress and performance of the STO. The STO completed all planned work within the scheduled period, and did not record a single case of lost time or medical injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Overcoming business processes which do not support the needs of the STO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A recent engagement with an international mining company necessitated the creation or modification of a number of business processes that impacted STOs. By reviewing these processes &amp;ndash; including contractor management, procurement, predictive maintenance, preventive maintenance, business improvement, lockout/tagout, reliability, permitting and compliance, among others &amp;ndash; the organization was able to improve its ability to scope the STO, start work packages on time and reduce crew waiting times. The impact was significant. Lockout/tagout and parts issues fell by 75 percent, and equipment failures and safety incidents decreased by 30 percent as shown on the &amp;ldquo;Percentage of Issues vs. Prior Shutdown&amp;rdquo; chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/23c54e70-9829-4715-b23f-6faef3de2c85_KT_STO_4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Percentage of Issues vs. Prior Shutdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Coordination and management of complex resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A major oil company underwent a turnaround event in its Singapore refinery which, in excess of US $200 million, was the biggest and most expensive it had attempted worldwide. It involved specialists and sub-contractors with whom the organization had no prior working experience, and equipment which had never been used before. As they neared the event, staff and sub-contractors found that they did not know who to approach for resources, technical support and issue resolution. In other words, there was no clarity on ownership of the work packages. Was it the asset owner, the main contractor or both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establishing an effective communication process in this stage entailed, first, specifically defining roles, such as Approve, Lead, Support, etc., for each major deliverable. Then, through a series of communication sessions, assignments of responsibility for these roles were made among the asset owner, main contractor and sub-contractors. The result was clear ownership and resources who knew where to go when they needed specific types of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Overcoming a reactive culture, moving toward anticipating and resolving issues before they impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In 2006, a major building materials manufacturer ran five days over its planned STO. In 2007, using the KT STO management process, an STO planned for 30 days was completed four days early. The reason they saw this improvement? The detailed risk management allowed the company to identify and prepare for issues before they occurred. Understanding the links between work packages, the resources used and surrounding activities enabled the STO team to look at more than the list of tasks to be completed. The data collected also allowed them to more accurately plan their future STO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/cd1b90d2-28fd-485e-bc84-4787a32c6505_KT_STO_5.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Planned Days Down vs. Actual Days Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Managing the expectations of diverse stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By managing the expectations of the organization&amp;rsquo;s diverse groups, STO improved greatly at a high-production concentrator. If perception really is reality, the STO management needs to not only deliver but be seen to deliver. In this case, all key management personnel &amp;ndash; from the general manager through corporate to operations through to key vendors &amp;ndash; expressed confidence that the impact of the STO management had been better than ever before. Vice presidents spent time in other areas of the organization; capital expenditure authorizations were approved; operations had confidence in scheduling; contractor and vendor idle time decreased. STO quality was shown to have increased overall by 60 percent (measured by on time and on scope), while cost was shown to have decreased by 40 percent (cost of run STO). Key to these results was providing a common language, process and understanding of both, and managing stakeholders&amp;rsquo; expectations. Results and expectations are two different areas of managing the performance of people; this means it is critical that key leaders have a shared understanding, and good information on both what is of value, and what will be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Achieving Shutdown Excellence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Kepner-Tregoe&amp;rsquo;s shutdown programs focus on delivering shutdown results on time and on budget while reducing possible risks associated with shutdown activities. KT has key applications that will ensure a sound risk management system is in place for your business shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KT has experienced successful execution of multi-million-dollar shutdowns. The company&amp;rsquo;s services are tailored to meet the individual needs of your business ranging from single days of coaching/training to full-time project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The KT Approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	KT applications provide the following to shutdowns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Discipline&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A common process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visibility of daily progress&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Managed risk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timely decisions by daily monitoring of cost vs. plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without careful planning and risk management, delays can cause the cost of lost production to far exceed the planned maintenance costs of a shutdown. A small investment in KT is minimal compared to the total costs of your shutdown or the risks of a poorly executed shut with costly delays and incomplete projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Types of Support Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	KT support for shutdowns includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shutdown definition facilitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project management training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shutdown management training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lean shutdown implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On the job coaching&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project planning support&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project software training and support&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Full time on site support to shutdown or maintenance managers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Teams and leader development&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Audits and recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Selected clients with whom KT has engaged in shutdowns include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bluescope Steel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cement Australia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Onesteel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rio Tinto&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Success Looks Like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When management at a heavy manufacturing site engaged KT to improve its shutdowns, the emphasis was to complete the shutdowns on time and on budget. Past shutdowns had run over time; but this time, finished product inventory was low and there was no allowing for extra hours. By working with KT, the manufacturer exceeded expectations. The shutdown came in 4.5 days ahead of schedule and half-a-million dollars under budget. Start-up time to full capacity from the previous year was reduced from 10 days to 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Got hoarders? Squirrels? How to overcome hidden stores</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you spend much time opening cabinets, drawers and looking behind locked doors in facilities and plant sites, it is almost guaranteed that you will come across someone&amp;rsquo;s stash of parts and consumable materials. When you begin a maintenance best practices implementation or storeroom improvement effort, one of the first things is to go and collect up all of those parts and materials to put them back into the storeroom. After all, there is a lot of money just laying around out there in those &amp;ldquo;hidden stores&amp;rdquo; locations, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before you jump to do this, STOP! If I have learned anything over the years, it is to take a few steps back and ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s far better to NOT assume anything, to hold off on assigning blame, and to simply ask &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One reason that is always present with maintenance people (operators aren&amp;rsquo;t exempt, either) is the thought process that says, &amp;ldquo;If I&amp;rsquo;m ordering one, then I better order two or three just in case one doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. After all, we don&amp;rsquo;t stock them, so if we needed it once, I&amp;rsquo;m sure we will need it again one day, right?&amp;rdquo; The downside to this thought process is that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford to stock a complete factory on the side, not to mention that it&amp;rsquo;s money spent that may never be used or used for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases, they &amp;ldquo;hoard&amp;rdquo; these items because they don&amp;rsquo;t trust the storeroom or materials management process. The stashes are &amp;ldquo;workarounds&amp;rdquo; for broken processes. You have to answer the &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;. Maybe they can&amp;rsquo;t find the parts in the storeroom because the short text descriptions to look up parts are not accurate. As they can&amp;rsquo;t find them using the short-text descriptions, they walk the isles looking for them. In an effort to force them to use the catalog and stay out of the storeroom, management decided to lay out the storeroom like a retail warehouse. In that setting, the concepts and processes are different compared to a maintenance storeroom. New stock items are not stored near like parts or by equipment types, but simply placed in the first open bin location they fit when added to stock. After a while, the 1-inch ball valve is stored in one corner of the warehouse, the 2-inch ball valve is six aisles away, stored on the opposite side. So, maintenance can&amp;rsquo;t find it in the catalog with the poor descriptors and they can&amp;rsquo;t find the part or a similar one to get the line up without walking the entire stockroom floor looking for it. Even then, they still don&amp;rsquo;t find it. These are just a couple of examples, as there are many more that reviewing the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You have to fix the system and the processes to eliminate the &amp;ldquo;hoarding&amp;rdquo; and those hidden stores. Once demonstrated and having earned the trust of the users, you can then be successful in collecting up the &amp;ldquo;hidden stores&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about your site? Do you have hidden stores? What are some of the reasons that your &amp;ldquo;hoarders&amp;rdquo; exist? What have you done to fix the issues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/9GZhTTGhJrg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Pop the Hood: A Maintenance Checklist Can Save Your Day</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" border="0" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/11/5/680378fd-af0e-428b-9c1c-162898e90f2d_checklist-large.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As both a practitioner and consultant, I am frequently reminded of how attention to detail somehow escapes us from time to time. I vividly remember the occasions when someone forgot to add oil to a gearbox on installation or got motor rotation wrong on a motor change. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I never enjoyed trying to explain the errors to a plant manager. Words ring hollow when trying to fill the void left from losing several hours of production to events like these. The frustrating part is that a simple procedure or checklist can prevent most, if not all, of these occurrences. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to tabulate the direct cost to the organization. Calculating the indirect loss of a customer or, worse yet, loss of life is not as easy. In some cases, you can&amp;rsquo;t put a number on it as it&amp;rsquo;s priceless. To better highlight procedures and checklists, let me share a recent experience with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It happens that I have been traveling to Mobile, Ala., once a month for the last several months. Every visit, the same major rental car company there has never failed to disappoint from a customer service and rental car perspective. Last week was no exception. I had high hopes for success when the counter agent informed me that my rental only had five miles and was new. That said, my checklist before leaving the lot includes inspecting the fuel level and the car for damage. When checking the fuel level, I noticed the protective clear plastic film had not been removed from the instrument panels. I speculated about their procedure to prep their cars. Did they use a checklist? It only took a 30-minute trip through stop-and-go traffic including about 15 miles on the Interstate at 65 mph to get my answer. No, no smoke, but just a smell that didn&amp;rsquo;t register well. I popped the hood, pulled the dipstick and ... no oil. In disbelief, I checked again to confirm. NO OIL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few calls later, the counter agent relays a message from the manager to drive the car back to the airport 30 miles away. I asked if they were serious. Drive with no oil? The dipstick was completely dry -&amp;nbsp;not a drop. Then, I&amp;rsquo;m told that I can buy the oil and get reimbursed. I like how it&amp;rsquo;s now my problem (go figure). More calls and roadside assistance gets them to agree to transport another car on a car hauler to me and haul the other one back. Now that was an expensive fix. The replacement car is new as well. Applying a continuous improvement loop to my checklist, I check the oil as part of the inspection. It&amp;rsquo;s got oil and the protective film has been removed on most of the instruments. But, the fuel tank is not full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you think established procedures and checklists could have prevented my misery? As the rental car location is not very large, I don&amp;rsquo;t image prepping new cars for service is an everyday occurrence. This makes having a procedures and checklists all the more important. From a maintenance perspective, we have similar issues. Much of the work we do is repetitive, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily do it every day. That&amp;rsquo;s where the maintenance planning function comes into play. These checklists should be built into the job plans and task lists. Many can be generic, meaning written once and reused in multiple areas (think technical library inside your CMMS). Ideally, you want a small area beside each step for the technician to initial indicating they did the work. In the end, management has to audit to ensure the process is working and people are held accountable. You never can predict the complete ramifications of not having the checklists or following the processes. It may be ruined equipment and loss of use, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While most groups will say they have checklists (although I have seen some organizations with none), requiring their use and the accountability are often major factors for success. In your organization, what processes do you have in place to ensure that people use maintenance procedures and checklists? How do you validate their use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/r2cLU-CGBDc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bad part descriptions can gum up storeroom processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to storerooms and materials management, one of the struggles that I repeatedly see in organizations is the issue of effective part descriptions, especially the short descriptions. This is especially true when you consider the domino effect these descriptions can cause. Using valves as an example, if your descriptions look like the following, then you need to give serious thought and effort toward your storeroom processes and data cleansing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BALL, VALVE, SS, 316, 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BALL VALVE, SS316, 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	543564, VALVE, BALL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	VALVE, BALL, 316SS, 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	XOMOX, VALVE, SS 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	V501, BALL, 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you have a large database, say 12,000 individual SKUs, it becomes really difficult for people to find what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for searching the short text descriptions. Sure, you can use a wildcard search like *VALVE*, but that really doesn&amp;rsquo;t narrow it down for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are some of the domino effects of short descriptions like these besides difficult searching?&amp;nbsp;It becomes easier to have duplicate parts under separate SKU numbers. From the descriptions above, each one may actually represent the same valve or equivalent from different manufacturers. When the planner can&amp;rsquo;t find the item using a SKU number or short text from the storeroom catalog, they look up items using past work order history. Odds are the previous item was not associated with a stock SKU either, so they paste the short description text into a purchase requisition and launch it to procurement.&amp;nbsp;Procurement doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time or the part knowledge to hunt the stock SKU number either. The part gets ordered and received.&amp;nbsp;We might even expedite it while four sit on the storeroom shelf.&amp;nbsp;Since there is no stock SKU reference, we can&amp;rsquo;t show usage or use the received part to swap with an older unit on the shelf (think &amp;quot;first in, first out&amp;quot;, or FIFO).&amp;nbsp;Then when we run a slow-moving report on the stockroom inventory, guess what shows up? The same part that we may have been buying every six months shows no issues in the last three years from the stockroom shelves.&amp;nbsp;It may even be automatically deleted from stock based on the mood of procurement if they own the stockroom.&amp;nbsp;It may be that we are using these items all over the plant and have no consumption recorded.&amp;nbsp;We really don&amp;rsquo;t have usage information to determine how many we should be stocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In light of this discussion, examine how you are doing with your storeroom inventory descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spans of control for maintenance planners and others</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As you may know, I travel frequently. The first part of the week was no different as I found myself on a flight to Atlanta. I was leafing through a maintenance book when the person across the aisle struck up a conversation. Turns out, he worked as a veteran maintenance supervisor in a large mill where he has worked for the last two years. He spoke about how things were bad from a reactive standpoint and had gotten worse after the mill downsized. As part of the downsizing effort, they had slaughtered some key players and replaced them with some not-so-key players. We talked about how their maintenance planning and scheduling activities were progressing, to which he was disappointed in the progress they had achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that he had two maintenance planner/schedulers with a span of control of about 1:25, yet he was still doing a tremendous amount of planning and scheduling himself. He commented that the span of 1:25 fell within the best practices guidelines. In addition, he mentioned from previous training that he learned that a planner should be able to plan three jobs per day but the planners were unable to accomplish this amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some additional conversation, we came to understand some of the opportunities present at the mill. I bet you could relate to the rest of the story: Management is dysfunctional. The storeroom is in disarray. The CMMS/EAM system was poorly implemented, and if a part existed in stores, you could not find it in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, let&amp;rsquo;s look as some possible solutions to help this gentleman. There never is but one silver bullet that will fix this stuff and, often, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that a good job plan can start out with three items: the crafts required, the estimated hours needed, along with the parts and materials. These three items are an excellent start, provided that you have a process for continuous improvement, also called a feedback loop. When the crafts execute the job, they should write down additional information to improve the plan, such as tools or additional parts required and task steps. When the planner gets this information back, they update the plan so that it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the next use. You might be able to enlist the help of a clerical person (if you are short on planner resources) who does well tippy-tapping on the keyboard. By doing approaching job plans in this manner, you may find that a planner can successfully plan more than three jobs per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of that said, you still may find planning to be a bottleneck if you are very reactive and the supporting systems have not been well implemented. While maintenance planning and scheduling can happen using a paper system over computerized tools, it&amp;rsquo;s still dependent on the supporting structures for success. For example, if your purchasing process is a nightmare, that can slow down the efforts. If the storeroom and materials management areas are poorly implemented and in shambles, that can affect the planning and scheduling processes, as well. There are a number of other factors that can influence maintenance planning and scheduling success, like the support of maintenance supervision. Now you can see why I tell people that formal maintenance planning and scheduling training is only half of the education required. Formal training should be followed up with coaching and mentoring for the maintenance planner/schedulers. This will help identify and enable the removal of obstacles that impede the planning and scheduling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also may want to consider reducing the span of control for your maintenance planner/schedulers. The recommended span of control for maintenance planning and scheduling is 15 to 30 craftspeople per maintenance planner. Supervision is recommended at eight to 15 crafts per supervisor. If your organization is really reactive, you may want to focus closer to the 15 craftspeople per planner and eight per supervisor. As you become more proactive, you can always adjust the ratio higher over time to reflect that improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What else could you identify from your world that would help a reader in a similar situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/C2rRXfLNNtA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability planning: The earlier, the better</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Proper planning prevents poor performance.&amp;nbsp;Cutting out the&amp;nbsp;roof to extract a critical motor with a helicopter is not the definition of proper planning. Significant thought into maintenance considerations and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) should be&amp;nbsp;part of new project planning. A facility with proper maintenance and reliability planning stands a better chance of maximizing throughput and availability, making them more competitive in the&amp;nbsp;marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Make sure maintenance work doesn't create process bottlenecks</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With there being a never-ending need for manufacturers to produce at reduced cost, all opportunities to improve output must be investigated and exploited to maintain a competitive advantage. One strategy in improving output is to review and address the conditions or events that restrict the output of production facilities, which is often referred to as bottlenecking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bottlenecking can occur in any aspect of a manufacturing process, from the supply of raw materials through to delivery of product to a customer, and the causes will vary significantly between industries and processes. An aspect of manufacturing where bottlenecking is often found is in the inability of the equipment to reliably produce the required output. Potential causes for this may be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Physical&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the equipment breaking down often;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Human&lt;/strong&gt;, such as poor work practices; or&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Latent&lt;/strong&gt;, such as ineffective planning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance and reliability issues touch on all of these potential causes. This article discusses what aspects of maintenance affect plant output, and then what actions can be taken to mitigate these negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reactive Maintenance Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A typical reactive maintenance organization displays the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The organization plans and schedules preventive work on the day the task is required.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Breakdowns are commonplace and are attended to at the expense of completing planned tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Down days are not planned into the production schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Documented planned maintenance tasks are few.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			There are no dedicated maintenance planners.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Materials are not effectively managed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bills of materials are incomplete or don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Operation security risks have not been assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			There is no structured system for development of maintenance plans.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Technical information is not well managed and often difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Modifications to plant are made without applying a change management process.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Analysis of failures does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment being maintained by organizations in this &amp;ldquo;reactive spiral&amp;rdquo; is likely to become less reliable over time because critical preventive tasks are not being completed and root cause of failures is not often addressed. At some stage in this reactive spiral, plant reliability may become a bottleneck in the production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s how a reactive organization can generate bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning and scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Terry Wireman is an author of a host of books that focus on maintenance. Terry claims that highly reactive maintenance organizations can spend as little as two hours per day on the tools, and unplanned work can cost up to five times the cost of a planned task. With tool time being so low, how effective will planned outages be? In reality, good planning and scheduling will improve tool time to at least six hours in an eight-hour shift. So in this instance, a previous eight-hour outage could be reduced to less than three hours. If your process is capacity constrained, then this will eliminate a five-hour bottleneck; however if capacity is not an issue, then up to three times as much work may be completed in the same time frame, effectively reducing the cost to maintain. When you apply this logic to a 12-month schedule of work and include some large multi-week shutdowns, it becomes clear that improving the planning and scheduling of maintenance work is well worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without going on to extensive detail, there are a few critical steps related to implementing effective planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			You have to accept that there is a need for change, and management must support the change.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dedicated maintenance planners must be deployed whose sole task is to plan and schedule work (not execute it).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Detailed task lists have to be developed for all repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Spares and bills of materials must be effectively managed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A process must exist to manage work through the system.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Planned outages must be put in place, and this process must be locked in with production.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For those that want to head down this path or improve their current systems, there are many excellent texts and consulting organizations available that could assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakdown maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Breakdown of equipment can be a significant cause of bottlenecks in production processes. There are fundamentally two forms of breakdown that create bottlenecks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			High-frequency, short-duration breakdowns&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Extended-delay breakdowns&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The effects of an extended delay are obvious; no production equals no output. But how often is the cause of the breakdown assessed with a view of eliminating the defect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The high-frequency, short-duration breakdowns are far more sinister. Often, these types of failures are hidden as the operations staff has developed workarounds, such as following an unapproved procedure, cycling the power or slowing the process down. In time, the operations staff begins to accept these delays as being normal. Does your business measure how often these events occur and how much time is lost for each event? It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to understand what these losses are, but another entirely when it comes to eliminating these defects. Reactive organizations rarely find the time to address the root cause of any issues.&lt;br /&gt;
	The key steps for reducing breakdowns and, hence, removing a potential bottleneck are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use your CMMS to record all breakdowns, no matter how small they are.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use Pareto graphs to regularly assess the failure data to identify chronic reliability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Determine which of these issues are causing the most significant losses or causing unacceptable bottlenecks. These issues will be the highest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Determine which of these issues are particularly annoying to the operations personnel. There may not be significant financial gain in focusing on these issues, however it is likely to have a positive effect on motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Utilize run charts to determine if improvements have been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planned outages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To maintain plant and equipment to an acceptable standard, it is vitally important that maintenance-related outages are valued and embedded in the production schedule. However, in reactive organizations, it is common to see down-day schedules changed or cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not desirable for maintenance work to be planned and scheduled, only to find on the day that the equipment cannot be put down due to production requirements. This indicates a fundamental issue with the production planning system, as missing critical maintenance may lead to chronic losses, which in turn will reduce output. There often is also a significant effect on the maintenance organization in that the well-planned job now has to be moved, and work has to be found for the previously scheduled workers. If the planned outage itself is causing a bottleneck, then the reason for the outage and allocated time need to be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Maintenance strategy is concerned with deciding how to maintain a plant, setting up an appropriate maintenance organization, establishing usable maintenance systems and directing the maintenance effort. Before you can plan and schedule, you have to have a maintenance strategy, because if you haven&amp;rsquo;t defined what you need to know, how can you plan what to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well-constructed maintenance strategies will be unique for each type of equipment and will include a number of different activities which when applied will assist in ensuring that equipment can reliably meet its production requirements. Maintenance strategies generally fall into one of four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Run to failure.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a legitimate strategy when the implications of the failure are minimal or there is no way of predicting the failure. Lighting is an excellent example of this&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Condition monitoring (vibration analysis, thermography, etc.).&lt;/strong&gt; These technology-driven inspections are the preferred method for understanding whether equipment requires overhaul, as they are usually non-intrusive and can predict issues accurately. The theory goes, &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s not broken, don&amp;rsquo;t try to fix it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Fixed-time inspection/replacement. &lt;/strong&gt;Fixed-time inspection is another form of condition monitoring, but it may require some intrusive work. Fixed-time replacement is used where the wearout rate of any item is well known (e.g. oil in a car).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Fixed-time overhaul.&lt;/strong&gt; This should be a last resort for most organizations and should only be used when wearout rates are very well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How maintenance strategies can create bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In years gone by, when maintenance labor was plentiful, there were some very extensive planned maintenance programs in place, with most being based on the &amp;ldquo;best guess&amp;rdquo; of the experienced people in the business. The results were often a plant that was being over-servciced or the servicing was occurring on equipment that had very low failure rates. In the last 20 years, there has been a significant movement to actions being based on the mitigation of failure modes, using tools such as Reliability-Centered Maintenance or PM Optimization. The aim of these tools is to help ensure the right strategy is applied based on sound knowledge and data. The effect of this is that over-servicing is eliminated and the focus of maintenance is moved toward condition-based assessment, which generally can be completed on-line. Over-servicing leads to longer down periods, an increase in the incidence of premature failures, and can possibly create a process bottleneck. Having correctly developed and deployed maintenance strategies will mitigate this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two significant aspects of the maintenance organization that may have an effect on process throughput &amp;ndash; the structure of the organization and the skill level of the members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The optimum organizational structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ultimately, the aim of the maintenance department is to ensure that equipment can meet the output requirements of the business at the lowest cost. Leading from the earlier discussion, it is clear that the less reactive your business is, the more efficient and cost effective you will become. So, the organization needs to be heading toward a structure that supports planning, scheduling and good materials management practices. On the other side of the equation, the organization may need to be able to respond quickly to emergencies and then be able to have time to assess the failures. Ultimately, it is critically important that the structure in place helps support ownership of equipment and issues at a trade/craftsman level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ideal structure will be different for every business, but as a guide there should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A maintenance and reliability manager (may of may not be reporting to a production manager)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Maintenance planners/schedulers (ratio of around one for every 10 trades)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A reactive maintenance crew that deals with all breakdowns and unscheduled work&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A maintenance crew that deals with planned, preventive and predictive maintenance&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Condition monitoring and reliability engineering resources&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Shutdown contract resources for work greater than the base load&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and skill levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fundamentally, if your workforce does not have the skills to complete a task correctly, you will get a second-class result. Maintenance workers must have the appropriate tertiary training in their specific skill area, and the organization should ensure that the workforce is kept up-to-date with equipment and technology they have installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the maintenance organization can create bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	An inadequate maintenance organization structure can create process bottlenecks. If your reactive crew is not resourced enough, then you may have equipment down waiting on repair. If there is little or no higher-level technical support, short delays could become much longer ones. When there are not enough people in your planned maintenance crew, or they are not trained correctly in completing a task, an eight-hour shutdown may become a 12-hour shutdown. All of these possibilities will reduce output and potentially create a bottleneck in your production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The steps required to help prevent your maintenance organization from creating process bottlenecks need to address both the organizational structure and training issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In relation to training, you will need to understand what skills your team requires to maintain the plant. This will have to be matched against the current skills set and the gaps identified. From this, available training programs will need to be developed and a training schedule built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the organization structure, it is important to understand your current work patterns. How much of your current load is reactive vs. proactive? Are you not completing all required maintenance work? This information will help you understand where the labor should be placed and may highlight areas where not enough labor is available. If you are moving to or improving your planning and scheduling, the split between reactive and proactive will have to be reassessed as your systems improve. The ultimate aim is to have a less reactive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If your process bottlenecks are linked closely to the maintenance and reliability of your equipment, it is most likely you have a highly reactive maintenance organization. To move from a primarily reactive regime, significant focus must be placed on developing and deploying systems that move the organization toward being proactive. This requires effective planning and scheduling, well-developed maintenance strategies, a detailed work management process, a skilled workforce that is resourced adequately, a process to determine and rectify the root cause of failures, and a good materials management process. In reality, all of these traits are commonly accepted as being best practice, and the application of them will limit the maintenance and reliability of equipment being a cause of process bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/b22k-W6DyWc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Round out your HACCP plan for maintenance to cut food risks</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance employees are often the exception to the rule for working on both sides of food plants, increasing the risk of cross-contamination. To be followed consistently, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans need to be realistic. Engaging maintenance crafts in creating the HACCP plans reduces this risk. Preplanning steps into every maintenance job plan also can significantly reduce the risk of cross-contamination. Maintenance employees have to take it upon themselves to do the right thing as they cross that often invisible line from one side of their plant to the next. Contractors who come on site need to be trained in safety issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical food site, the buildings are physically divided to contain certain food properties and health risks (see Figure 1). In a precooked meat plant, there is a raw side and a cooked packaging area divided by huge ovens. In beef processing, the complex is divided into two separate areas, kill and packaging, which are divided by coolers. (Similarly, in pharmaceutical plants, there are sterile areas that have 100 percent containment [moon suits required] all the way down to final product packaging areas near the end of the process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/mikes101.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most production employees are intentionally routed to separate areas within these environments. There are different dressing rooms, restrooms and even divided lunch rooms in some businesses. A containment plan is typically well thought out and executed for production employees. However, maintenance employees are not always held to the same strict codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s 3:35 p.m. at shift change and the packaging manager finds out that his key packaging machine has jammed its feed roll, and the only maintenance guy still here during shift change is Louie. Louie has done this job several times, but this afternoon, he has been on the raw side of the house fixing a bacon slicer. He could be 30 seconds away by cutting through the oven rooms, but that would be an exception to the HACCP plan. On the other hand, it could take five to 10 minutes to make sure his tools are cleaned up and he arrives relatively germ-free for the next job. What is Louie going to do? What is an acceptable response and what really happens in your plant? What happens next is really up to the management running the operation. Did the packaging manager reinforce the food safety aspect in his radio call to Louie? Are those ideas shared every time, or just when it is convenient? Because these scenarios occur all too often, maintenance has to care about doing the right thing and management needs to support this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crafts have a double duty to avoid contamination when working in food environments. When possible, maintenance people are assigned to work on only one side of a food plant, but exceptions to the rule do occur. They are truly walking the line with food contamination risks every day. Plant leaders, in coordination with government inspectors and employees, should work together to continuously improve the food safety aspect of daily business. Leaders must take the time to reinforce food safety procedures with their maintenance staff and not request emergency attendance unless it is truly an emergency. They also need to recognize that, for the craftspeople, it takes a little longer to get each job completed and sterilized when working in a food environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some elements to consider adding to your HACCP plan if they have not already been introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Retrain maintenance employees on HACCP training frequently; include them in committees for improving food safety&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Encourage maintenance employees to learn best practices from other maintenance groups&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Include in each job plan:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Instructions to maintain a sterile environment during the tasks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clear direction for any dry clean-up procedures required for that area to get started&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recommendations for cleaning the asset and tools after the job is done&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recommendations for leaving that environment and heading to the next job without contamination issues&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When maintenance must be performed during the third-shift sterilization process, list special considerations that should go into effect for that job at that time of day&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Craftspeople need to maintain records on food-grade lubricants used and make sure they are using clean tools to inject these lubricants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If craftspeople are expected to work both sides of the house, consider:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Disposable gloves that are easy to access (two different colors)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Disposable boot/shoe covers (two different colors)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Jackets or coveralls that can be changed at the point of entry for each environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Toolboxes or carts set up for both sides to reduce carry-over contamination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always use the appropriate disposal containers per type of waste: No. 2 food product, hazardous material, contaminated food, equipment parts and pieces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If there are physical items like janitorial supplies, warning/working placards, caution tape and other commonly used items on each job, purchase a set for each side of the business&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add disinfectant wipes to the toolbox to sterilize tools and surfaces as the jobs are completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/mikes102.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using contractors within the maintenance group also can introduce risk in food safety. Many contractors have been on site many times before and know what they should be doing. Regardless of their past performance, they should be HACCP trained, including a working knowledge of foodborne illnesses and methods to reduce risks. They should be taught how to identify high risk situations and report them to management if there is any possibility of food contamination. Maintain plant records on HACCP-certified contractors and renew that training regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance group has a significant responsibility for food safety and reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Typically, crafts have the authority to cross the line in food plants from one side to the other. With that authority, there is a duty to make sure every reasonable effort has been taken to reduce contamination risks while performing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/G26c5fOFnLM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Strategic workforce planning is emerging as a top priority</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the just-published research report from Aberdeen Group, a Harte-Hanks Company, organizations cited shifting demographics and rapidly evolving business requirements as key factors driving the adoption of workforce planning. The study, &lt;a href="http://aberdeen.com/summary/report/benchmark/6358-RA-workforce-planning-management.asp"&gt;Strategic Workforce Planning: Winning Scenarios for Uncertain Times&lt;/a&gt;, also found that 64 percent of organizations expect organizational efforts in workforce planning to increase in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Organizations are still wary after the ups and downs of the last few quarters, and are looking to new strategies to help them get a handle on their workforce needs moving ahead,&amp;rdquo; said Mollie Lombardi, research analyst, Human Capital Management, Aberdeen. &amp;ldquo;This research showcases how organizations that are taking a longer-term view of their talent needs, and are taking a collaborative approach to aligning their workforce plans to business priorities are seeing the greatest impact on business performance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report also finds that more than twice as many of the top-performing companies are making workforce planning a top executive priority, with 28 percent of Best-in-Class organizations holding the CEO or board of directors primarily accountable for workforce planning, vs. 13 percent of all organizations.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Expert advice on creating partnership agreements</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Partnership agreements are contracts between functional areas of the plant which have an effect on overall reliability. Developing, fostering and committing to plant partnership agreements is an important element in successful reliability improvement initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why use partnership agreements?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ron Moore from the RM Group Inc. in Knoxville, Tenn., in cooperation with Andrew Fraser from Reliability Manufacturing Association conducted a study which shows many functional groups within a plant have an impact on the overall reliability of the site, not just maintenance. In fact, maintenance is not even the major contributor to losses associated with reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="264" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/mikes01.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Losses and Downtime Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chart reveals multiple stages of an asset&amp;rsquo;s life and potential defects. Behind those defects are departments of employees selecting new purchases, receiving and storing goods, and key people installing, operating and maintaining these assets. Organizations need to allow the people who perform these activities day after day to develop a list of ideas of how other departments could make their life easier. The same people will also need to be open-minded enough to accept the suggestions on how they could produce better results for other departments. These lists will become the master list from which people will select a few measureable topics to improve, taking baby steps toward a partnership agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do partnership agreements apply?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A partnership agreement should include business functions affecting reliability. Here are some examples of where partnership agreements can improve reliability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: production and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: services and production&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: reliability engineering and operating areas&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: stores/procurement and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: planning and operating areas&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper give and take: sales and production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you create partnership agreements?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1) Create two cross-functional groups for each agreement and ask several questions to uncover tensions and identify aspects that need to improve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the key success factors for each group?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you could fix one thing about working with the other group, what would it be?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What would change about this process?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What does their work cause you to do?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What do you think the other groups would say about us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answers to these questions reveal subjects that deserve some deep thought on how to improve relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Ask the groups to identify the challenges that need to be addressed. The agreement needs to begin with a stated problem or set of problems that the new processes or tools are going to improve. Summarize on a single page the areas of importance for both partners in the agreement and refine the problem statement to prioritize which processes, assets or interactions to focus on first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3) The groups then begin to consider steps they can take to close the gaps that have been identified. It&amp;rsquo;s important to identify the functional roles involved in the departments or functions within a single department. Tasks and responsibilities are assigned to functional roles, not to individuals, so that improved processes are sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4) The group next develops a set of metrics that measure the performance of the commitments, new processes and/or tools. Defining metrics for each desired change improves the likelihood of success and minimizes subjective evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What factors are critical for success?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Developing new tools and processes takes time and requires the involvement of many different perspectives. Depending on the daily work load, it may take the teams several weeks to gain alignment and consensus. Once developed, an agreement can be piloted in a work area for a period of time to test the agreement. Anticipate that there will be some issues, setbacks and difficulties in execution. Partnership agreements should be viewed as living and ever-changing documents that provide a guiding light for culture change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Getting groups to adapt to the new processes and sustain the changes is the key. A six- and 12-month checkup is recommended. At these sustainability checkups, the group can revisit the metrics that were designed and confirm that they are still valid and add value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Participating in developing partnership agreements builds employee engagement that helps fuel continuous improvement. While the goal of culture change can seem vague and hard to define, well-planned and executed partnership agreements direct culture in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They are visible, traceable and increase accountability, thereby increasing reliability as well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to get the most out of your CMMS/EAM system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many firms today are not leveraging the full capacity of their current computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM) systems. Analyst studies indicate that as little as 5 to 10 percent of current CMMS/EAM capabilities are used in many cases, with medium use factored in the 20 to 30 percent level. It is the exceptional firm that exceeds 40 percent of the capability and benefits available from a fully implemented CMMS/EAM to them. But why is this the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article explores the current trends taking place within CMMS/EAM with a look at both the present and future trends emerging. Many firms, quite frankly, have not kept abreast of the many features and functions available to them or have operated in an isolated world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of change&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We must first acknowledge that we are living and working in a dynamic world. Things are moving around us continuously, whether we realize it or not. It is perfectly natural to attempt to hold the world still as we write new code or add some element of functionality in the perfect operating world. Acknowledging change is the first step; having the necessary support and service systems in place to accommodate those variations is the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changes often take place slowly, like the introductions of steam power over sail or the railroads over the horse and wagon. It took more than 20 years for the car and truck to become commercially viable 100 years ago. Many firms continue to hang on to their &amp;ldquo;tried-and-true&amp;rdquo; manual and paper-based record systems simply because it was the way &amp;ldquo;we always do things around here.&amp;rdquo; Case in point is today&amp;rsquo;s doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, governed by stringent HIPAA regulations, or real estate closings, still requiring a mountain of paper with numerous signatures. Between 22 and 25 percent of healthcare expenses are consumed by administrative paperwork. So, we agree that as the world turns, some systems have an improved adoption over other delivery mechanisms. An example of rapid uptake may be the newest iPod, sold to every available teenager by the millions at Christmastime, with capability to download thousands of songs and a variety of videos and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We live in an integrated world&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As the planet gets smaller with direct connection, we can make ourselves available at any point in the world on very short notice. VOIP (voice over Internet protocol), Web conferencing and satellite technology can find us anywhere on the globe. Examples are Webinars broadcast globally and VOIP, where for nearly free, we can communicate in real-time and Webcast our intentions to a global audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our world is now connected, more than just a few months ago. System integrators (ie: Accenture, Bearing Point, Cap Gemini, Delliotte, IBM, etc.) are earning billions of dollars connecting various software operating platforms and applications so that business leaders have better visibility into their operations. Moving information more effectively today is the new corporate challenge. Being able to move data and process it &amp;ndash; making decisions &amp;ndash; will be even more important in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Twenty years ago, moving bits and bites at 300 dpi with acoustical couplers was considered average, and the high-speed modem was 1,200 baud. Today, most firms are abandoning dial-up, and one advertiser states that they &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t do jack&amp;rdquo;, meaning the abandonment of the wire and connector. DSL and high-speed lines continue to move data traffic at astounding speeds (300 baud vs. 100M) compared to the movements of yesteryear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using this capability, firms need to leverage integration of their applications into a collective executive decision support system often referred to as analytics or business intelligence. The challenge is how to connect the numerous niche applications to be able to operate as a unified enterprise resource planning (ERP) company-wide decision service and maintenance support process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The niche decision; was it the right one?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many large firms have a large number of stand-alone niche service and maintenance applications running. Making the niche decision, selecting best-of-breed, appeared to be the right thing to do at the moment to address a specific service need or service application. Having a human resource (HR/HCM) package, a stand-alone warehouse or inventory system, transportation module or procurement package all seemed like the right decision at the time. But times have changed. These systems now need to communicate with one another. Inventory needs to communicate with transportation and with procurement. The supply chain needs to be completed by interconnection. The cost burden for this synergy of the multiple disparate niche solutions will be a significant portion of any IT organization&amp;rsquo;s costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent estimates indicate that up to 70 percent of IT budgets are devoted to maintaining and interconnecting existing applications. So, in reality, was the niche decision a good one, hundreds of times over, as the new challenge is how to connect them together? The other alternative may be to look for systems on a common platform or already pre-connected such as from full-suite ERP providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fix it yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Surveys indicate that approximately 30 percent of service visits can be avoided by proper care of a skilled or trained operator. Industry is moving toward more highly reliable devices that require less maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When was the last time you changed the spark plugs in your car? With onboard diagnostics becoming more prevalent in products and equipment today, users have the ability to fault locate and repair many of the devices in service. Examples include office copiers or printers that run diagnostics to locate paper jams or failures. We anticipate seeing more CRUs &amp;ndash; customer replaceable units, meaning as a part fails or begins to fail, a diagnostic feature will identify the assembly and indicate to the user that the certain part needs replacement. In turn, the product sends a signal to a call center that can automatically run a diagnostic to confirm the error report, and once satisfied that the unit is in degraded mode, then mails a replacement part to the user for replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent experiments on toner and developer or paper outages have proved successful with printers. When toner or any consumable begins to run low, even when an oil change is due on your car, a replacement package may arrive at your door one or three days prior to stock-outs &amp;ndash; a perfect example of lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last time I went to Costco and stocked up on toner, I found that by the time I used the last cartridge (as I needed to buy a supply of 50), the toner had solidified or petrified and the cartridge expiration date was four years earlier. So, the operation here is seamless to the user and perfect from a lean (zero stock) inventory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Greater emphasis is being placed today on the unit operator to be sensitive to maintenance requirements. On the other hand, management is demanding what seems to be 100 percent availability. In many cases, operators detect malfunction prior to catastrophic failures, such as motors seizing due to lack of lubricant, of strange noises, vibrations, early alerts or some indicator of possible failure. It is in the best interest of the equipment that the unit be investigated immediately; however, logic dictates that if the equipment is engaged in a critical production operation, when taking the unit out of service would result in the loss of perhaps millions of dollars in production volume, then the unit is expected to continue performing despite the possible negative consequences of continued operation (such as in a low oil or overheat condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay me now or pay me later&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the best investments that firms can make is the expenditures on periodic service and preventive maintenance repairs on their operating equipment. Mechanical products that involve any type of movement, even fans on electrical equipment, require periodic servicing, cleaning and update to maintain the original integrity and continued reliable performance. When I travel to numerous locations in the world and take taxi cabs to various cities, I often inquire as to number of miles on the vehicle and the frequency of oil and filter changes. One cab in Houston had more than a half-million miles as the driver reported that the oil was changed religiously every 3,500 miles. Materials used today in the production of equipment are much more durable than the materials of yesterday. If properly serviced, firms can enjoy many years of productive operation from their assets if they were just properly maintained to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil and filter changes along with tire rotations and the periodic 30,000-mile major services are the best investments car owners can make in retaining the original condition and higher residual value of their vehicles. Being stranded on the highway is never a pleasant experience. Failed fan belts, tires, windshield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	wiper blades or hoses are just a few examples of lower-cost items that can and should be inspected for wear and needed replacement prior to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintenance is a business, not just a service&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many think of maintenance as a necessary evil, a cost center, overhead or non-productive. This is far from the truth. Maintenance operations perform a highly valuable service to maintain assets and related production equipment on the condition of its original condition and to provide reliable and economic operation. Maintenance is serious business as it works to comply with safety, health and quality regulations. Units from fire extinguishers to elevators and escalators need to have documented evidence of inspection and service to perform properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Picture yourself picking up a fire extinguisher in the time of an emergency to put out an office fire, only to realize the unit is non-operational with an expired tag from four years earlier &amp;ndash; like my example of the expired printer toner. Fortunately, we have inspection laws that require commercial and industrial work environments to be properly protected with the availability of inspected, tested and operating fire extinguishers. The existence of an inspection tag is not the absolute certainty of a functioning device, as certain very low-cost providers of fire extinguisher services are known to have delivered and installed non-working units as a scam. Of course, firms should be alerted to these scam artists at prices too good to be true because it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The use of consistent-performing service firms is the best assurance for reliable performance. Shaving a few dollars in service procurement by moving to a lower-quality lubricating oil or filter is probably not the best avenue for cost reduction. Many firms take this path on a temporary basis that eventually becomes a long-term trend. The performance eventually catches up with the expenditures. Lower-quality consumables, from copier toner and developer to lubricating oils and filters for engines to pump seals, although attractive in saving money in the short run, eventually lead to asset replacement in a shorter time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It matters because critical production may depend on it. From elevators to automatic doors for office entry, to pumps, pipes, tanks and motors in a refinery, proper service and maintenance are crucial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having all the information available to make the best possible decision in maintenance planning is important in achieving the proper service and production goals for the operation. It would be unrealistic to attempt to run a major service organization manually, on paper, with numerous clerks, as it was done in the early days of the Industrial Revolution. With the advent of the computer and modern databases, firms now enjoy the luxury of enterprise asset management (EAM) to better control maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advanced programs have been developed to guide firms in optimizing the maintenance approach so that performance can be maintained at a highly reliable state, approaching Six Sigma uptime (99.999 percent). Think of the complexity of jet engines mounted on a large airframe that is capable of flight. Jet engine performance at the 99.9 percent level would yield several crashes per day at failed takeoff &amp;ndash; totally unacceptable. As a result, airlines have adopted sophisticated and highly regulated maintenance procedures, coupled with inspections and certifications, to assure proper performance at or above the Six Sigma threshold (3.4 incidents per billion). For this reason, the American airline industry is experiencing one of the best records regarding airline safety and reliability. This safety and reliability model is the envy of industry. If only other operating systems were able to perform at the same level of service, such as our local cable TV provider whose service only seems to fail during playoff games in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is significant to note that many firms are satisfied with the way things have been done in the past. Uptake on advanced maintenance has been adopted by those on the cutting edges of competition, innovation and performance in a survival market. Large firms employing thousands in a continuous production model, such as an assembly line, cannot afford to remove assets from service when millions of dollars in production value are at stake. For this reason, firms have adopted the enterprise maintenance model linking together their operating, production and utilities in a fully integrated view for consistent servicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="382" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/slade01.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance strategies usually fall into one of several categories depending on both the value and importance of the asset. The diagram above depicts the service and maintenance strategy for firms producing products, from razor blades to locomotives. The most inexpensive products are typically never maintained and disposed of after use, called &amp;ldquo;throw-aways&amp;rdquo;. Cell phones, small TVs and VCRs now fall into this category. Some devices such as copy machines or printers are serviced by their users or operators. More advanced, skilled technicians with the proper parts repair units (e.g., washing machines and dryers) typically conduct this service. Moving up the maturity curve, complex or sophisticated devices employing numerous parts and/or of higher value may receive some type of preventive maintenance to achieve proper operation such as the example of regular oil changes for vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the real-time access of low-cost Internet or cell technology, firms can now remotely monitor the performance of their assets to assure proper operations. Unit sensors can transmit temperature or pressure settings along with critical vibration or noise parameters &amp;ndash; such as the impending failure of a bearing. Some firms go one step further to even have cameras focused on assets in the event a foreign object such as a tree limb or other foreign or falling object would interfere with operations. Also, low-cost motion detectors alert security in the event a trespasser or animal violated the perimeter zone such as in secure utility or airport operations. Bringing all of this intrusion, operating and malfunction information together into one place becomes the cornerstone for the modern maintenance EAM operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Design operations need to develop predictive models for their products. We know when razor blades fail after a few uses and we know when it is time to retire a motor once the seals have failed and replacement parts are no longer available. With assets from pumps to motors, vehicles to airplanes, manufacturers need to make available to users a typical use-model of predictive behaviors. These predictions guide operations through normal or abnormal life cycles of assets to better predict performance. Returning to the example of the taxi with 500,000 miles, if properly maintained, car engines can have a long life. Several examples of cars going more than 1 million miles have been validated. Predictive models help companies plan their future capital and maintenance horizons better. Capital expenditures can be better forecasted while units can operate with improved predictability with the availability of such valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The highest degree of integration is the EAM state where all of the assets are interrelated and monitored from a single system of maintenance and operations. Using an EAM in conjunction with operating systems for production allows firms to enjoy the great benefits available from reliable production. Examples include transportations firms that need to take assets out of service when on the ground &amp;ndash; as it is not possible to remove planes from service in the air, or similarly, locomotives, buses, taxis or monorails during operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single source of truth&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Having all of the information available in real time in one place is utopia. By having this, information becomes &amp;ldquo;actionable&amp;rdquo;, meaning if a parameter should fall out of range (min/max), an alert can trigger immediate investigation and create a service order if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technicians can review the operating condition via remote monitor and compare it with the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s predictive model. Technicians would know that by operating the asset under the new parameter, such as in elevated temperature, the asset would fall into degraded mode and either shorten the life span or operate uneconomically until the needed repair was made. Operating options would be available instead of just hard-failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EAM provides the framework for firms to adopt their best practices into operations settings to achieve better performance. However, achieving these goals is easier written than accomplished. To accomplish this end, firms need to adopt IT practices to capture data into a unified database or warehouse for processing with analytics and real-time dashboards for management visibility. Line managers need the drill-down tools to access answers to conditions without leaving their office or the control room. When all of this information comes together, assets can work in harmony with each other and maintenance management can move toward the proactive role instead of the traditional role of reactive fire fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To operate in today&amp;rsquo;s competitive world, firms need an integrated EAM system. By working in harmony, maintenance and production assets can yield greater production provided the information is made available to service management. To achieve this end, maintenance management needs to extract the critical asset information to be in a position to detect failures prior to occurrence. Manufacturers need to share with their customers the predictive behaviors of assets so that user firms can be ahead of the failure curve and take needed proactive steps to eliminate unanticipated failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computer and communications technologies exist today to help firms achieve this goal; acronyms such as BPEL (Business Process Extension Language) and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) will become household words in the service and maintenance communities. With prices shrinking for data storage, communications and networks, cost should no longer be a barrier for firms to use available technology to accomplish their desired operating objectives. Tomorrow, with foreign competition growing at expanding rates, it will be the firm that fully leverages its EAM systems in the context of its enterprise information architecture that will achieve competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Coors Brewing does planning and scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many of you may ask, &amp;ldquo;Why the focus on planning and scheduling at Coors Brewing Company?&amp;rdquo; Why not Reliability-Centered Maintenance analysis or preventive maintenance or MRO or other best-in-class activities? The short answer is that &amp;ldquo;We are.&amp;rdquo; Our current initiative is to develop an effective and efficient planning and scheduling process for CBC. To do this, the overall process of &amp;ldquo;perform routine maintenance&amp;rdquo; must be evaluated. Looking at only the planning and scheduling segment could result in a dysfunctional process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At CBC, we have embarked on a path we call &amp;ldquo;World Class Operations&amp;rdquo;, or WCO for short. WCO focuses on &amp;ldquo;effective maintenance, autonomous maintenance, quality, set-up time reduction, visual performance measures, 5-S and other principles. These are the principles that will support moving CBC to &amp;ldquo;best in class.&amp;rdquo; Why best in class? With today&amp;rsquo;s competitive environment, companies need to become more efficient than ever before. This is particularly true in the brewing industry where domestic beer production has been relatively flat over the past decade. New growth and profit opportunities are in the world markets. This is evident by the number of mergers and acquisitions over the past few years. CBC is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WCO objectives emphasize continuous improvement, standardization, and improved cost and execution efficiency. Within WCO, our maintenance teams are focused on enterprise asset management (EAM) and, more specifically, Business-Centered Maintenance (BCM) principles. These principles assess where we are today and drive goals and objectives to increase our level of performance for tomorrow. This is accomplished by assessing levels of proficiency within the organization and then setting goals for improvement, basically recognizing the principle of &amp;ldquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t improve what we don&amp;rsquo;t measure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planning and scheduling routine maintenance work is a critical process needed to achieve WCO principles at CBC. Within the CBC operational area, we have very diverse business units. They include two brewery and packaging facilities, one of which is the single-largest brewery in the world. We currently have a packaging facility and state-of-the-art brewery in Shenandoah. Add to this our joint venture business units operating our aluminum can and end manufacturing as well as bottle manufacturing. On top of this, we have Golden, Colo.-based malting operations (which supply malt for our Golden, Memphis and Shenandoah plants) and a very large utilities infrastructure to support all of the activities in Golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBC-IPSECI Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you might expect, every group has a somewhat different approach to performing routine maintenance work, and our maintenance teams believe their approach is the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; approach. Our objective is to develop and implement a &amp;ldquo;standard consistent&amp;rdquo; approach to planning and scheduling routine maintenance work which will optimize the reliability and availability of the equipment as well as achieve the lowest total cost of ownership during the useful life of the equipment. This is a cradle-to-grave approach, but this article will focus on the planning and scheduling aspects. Effective and efficient planning and scheduling is the heart and soul of optimizing corrective maintenance work. Our goal is to achieve greater than 85 percent planned maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our challenges to &amp;ldquo;a standard and consistent process&amp;rdquo; are many:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Different levels of planning resources available within each group&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Different levels of personnel performance and experience&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance teams are operating in different modes (some in reactive)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Change in culture (reward planned work vs. reacting to breakdown work)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Possible organizational changes to align with the process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Resistance to change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accountability for results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Data integrity and consistency (BOMs, master data, history)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		And then, how does this process interface with SAP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suffice it to say that we have many opportunities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are the benefits? Developing a standard &amp;ldquo;perform routine maintenance&amp;rdquo; process has many benefits to CBC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consistent, defined process (including roles and responsibilities) for the maintenance teams throughout a diverse organization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consistent standards are the foundation for continuous improvement and best practice environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, a standardized and consistent planning and scheduling process will result in more cost-effective planned work and less expensive reactive work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ability to move maintenance team members from one business unit to the next with minimal onboarding and retraining time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standardized key performance indicators to measure &amp;ldquo;planning effectiveness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;schedule adherence&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficient and effective planning will increase equipment availability, reliability and result in a lower total cost of ownership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spending can be directed to target critical equipment and highest priorities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		And, of course, optimizing/minimizing maintenance cost per barrel of product produced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where do we start? To gain agreement at a specific level of planning and scheduling detail at CBC, we have adopted a standard process approach that we call IPSECI, an acronym for Identify, Plan, Schedule, Execute, Control and Improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To gain agreement and consensus on a standard process, we convened a planning and scheduling summit a few years back where Asset Care representatives from each CBC operating unit were in attendance. This has been a difficult process given the challenges mentioned previously, but we are making progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A standard consistent process starts with defined terminology. We have spent significant time standardizing and defining common terminology &amp;ndash; for example, defining what constitutes a &amp;ldquo;breakdown.&amp;rdquo; In order to standardize the process, we need to be speaking the same language and principles. This underlies the importance of our WCO and EAM philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identifying and Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planning is one of the two focus areas of the improvement initiative; scheduling is the other. As mentioned earlier, planning and scheduling are the critical processes to improve maintenance reliability and equipment availability at the current level of maturity with SAP and within our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once corrective action is identified on our SAP notification and approved to work order status, each work order must be planned. This includes identifying craft hours, materials, special equipment needs and identifying the preliminary maintenance window when the work will be completed. Without a work order plan that includes quantities of labor hours, material dollars and other needed resources, progress toward achieving &amp;ldquo;planning effectiveness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;schedule adherence&amp;rdquo; objectives cannot be measured. All of the planning is for naught if quantities are not entered on the SAP work order and tracked during the course of the work progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next step is to create a work plan for a specific block of time. This work plan is then negotiated with a number of stakeholders to identify the maintenance window to complete the work. A work plan is a collection of work orders assembled for a specific piece of equipment or line to be completed in a specified time frame. The work plan is the basis for our scheduling opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, our most significant challenge is in the area of entering resource quantities (hours and dollars) and dates on the work order. This will require discipline and accountability on the part of our planners, and in some cases significant cultural changes in how they perform their role within the organization. The focus of our KPIs will be to measure &amp;ldquo;planning effectiveness&amp;rdquo;, which will be defined in the improvement discussion. As a starting point in the change process, all planners will be required to enter &amp;ldquo;one line&amp;rdquo; operations on the work order. The entry will include total labor hours for a work order (mechanics, electricians, instrumentation techs and others). As our organization matures, we will progress to multiple operations on the work order to improve planning effectiveness. Without minimal information on the work order, measurements to improve performance are not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scheduling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are using SAP in your business, you will know that SAP is not a very friendly system to scheduling maintenance work orders in an effective way. Our teams have tried to use the SAP capacity planning table to schedule work with mixed results. Work orders must be &amp;ldquo;dispatched&amp;rdquo; and, when not completed, &amp;ldquo;un-dispatched&amp;rdquo;, requiring significant keyboard time. If the maintenance organization is relatively small, this tool can be of some benefit; however, if you have a significant degree of complexity with many functional locations requesting &amp;ldquo;capacity&amp;rdquo; from few work centers, resource visibility becomes a significant issue. Because of the dynamic nature of the SAP capacity planning table, &amp;ldquo;locking&amp;rdquo; in a schedule the Friday before the work week is not possible. This lack of a schedule &amp;ldquo;snapshot&amp;rdquo; does not accommodate our WCO principle to measure &amp;ldquo;schedule adherence&amp;rdquo; at the end of the following work week. All measurements become a manual exercise requiring a significant amount of resources to create information each week and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the help of outside consulting resources, CBC is planning to &amp;ldquo;turn-on&amp;rdquo; the scheduling capabilities in the Project System (PS) module within SAP. We believe the PS module will provide our maintenance teams with a more effective tool to schedule planned maintenance work using WBS (work breakdown structure) and network (schedule) elements. This functionality and the flexibility resides in our SAP system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A Friday schedule version can be &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; in and then measured at the end of the planned work week or window.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When a maintenance window changes, work orders can be rescheduled in minutes rather than hours.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work orders can be planned to the week or the day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planned cost vs. actual costs can be measured.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cost and schedule reports can be created easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Execute and Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At CBC, our craft are very good at executing work once they have been tasked with the work orders. I will not spend much time discussing work execution since it is not the primary focus of this initiative. Our challenge in executing work is to develop the craft discipline, accountability and computer skills to enter information into SAP on a shift basis. Without data entry every shift, work control and schedule adherence becomes very difficult and ineffective. Finding out about unfinished work at the end of the week can have significant impacts on equipment availability and reliability. Unfinished work can result in lost production opportunity and increased maintenance and operations cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Closing notifications and work orders are essential parts of creating equipment history and supports our WCO principles of &amp;ldquo;effective maintenance.&amp;rdquo; Again, this requires craft discipline, accountability and computer skills to enter data on a shift basis and once the work order is completed. Information entered on the notification and work order is essential to controlling and measuring &amp;ldquo;planning effectiveness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;schedule adherence.&amp;rdquo; Information entered on the SAP documents supports ongoing reliability engineering efforts to identify repeat failures, bad actors, cause analysis, and supports reducing MTBF and MTTR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An area that can deliver significant rewards is the continuous improvement process. Organizations often do not institutionalize this opportunity within their work process and lose the benefit of improving task lists, BOMs, quick fix routines and master data. I have a philosophy that once you have caught the mouse in your pantry, why would you turn him loose again? Our IPSECI process will have the continuous improvement segment built into the process. This will be an agenda item and a focused discussion between craft, planners, schedulers and other stakeholders. Identify and make the improvements when you have the mouse in the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KPIs are to be used as an improvement tool and go hand in hand with the continuous improvement process. Too often, organizations use KPIs as a hammer forcing people to develop &amp;ldquo;work-arounds&amp;rdquo; to look good and meet expectations. KPIs should be used as tools to improve performance over time. We started out with the following KPIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Schedule Adherence&lt;/strong&gt; = the number of scheduled work orders completed divided by the number of work orders scheduled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Break-in Work&lt;/strong&gt; = the number of unscheduled work orders completed divided by the total number of work orders completed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Maintenance Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; = the dollars spent on scheduled work orders divided by the total dollars spent on all work orders completed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Planning Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; = the total hours expended on planned work orders completed divided by the total hours planned for planned work orders completed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the current planning and scheduling initiative, we are defining business warehouse solutions to support measuring KPIs and reporting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How are we going to pull this off and deliver results? Change management and training are the keys to success and represent the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the work to be done. Buy-in from the top down and bottom up is essential to a successful roll-out. Integration of the process into the maintenance organizations will require cultural changes, possible realignment of organizations and modification of job roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To assure a successful roll-out, a communications plan is being developed and will include one-on-one meetings with senior and middle management. Without their buy-in, the priority to implement the process will be lost. We also are planning larger meetings with the plant technical leads (Asset Care team managers) and planners to communicate the changes in the process and identify potential impacts to the organizations involved. Training is the next most significant aspect of the roll-out. We are planning two days of training. The first day is the classroom training on the IPSECI process and the SAP Project System tools. The second day of training is the &amp;ldquo;test drive&amp;rdquo; of the process and tools using real data for each area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To drive home the process and cultural changes, planners and schedulers will be asked to use the process and system tools immediately upon leaving the training sessions. KPIs will be reported on a CBC period basis (four-week time interval) to monitor progress and provide opportunity for follow-up training as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The easiest aspect of the process change is configuring SAP to utilize the new tool to schedule maintenance work orders. The toughest hurdle will be managing the cultural change!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/yWDDuJRzEH0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Centralized vs. decentralized maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Companies often ask if maintenance planning and scheduling will work if they have a decentralized maintenance organization. Yes, it will. In fact, they need planning and scheduling just as much as a centralized shop. Let's review why. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Centralized maintenance organizations excel at planning and scheduling - to a fault if they don't give adequate attention to operations' concerns. The operations group may feel there is a "maintenance black hole." "Work orders go in, but don't come out." Or, they say, "I have to make maintenance do it today or promise to do it tomorrow; otherwise, they will never do it!" So, we decentralize maintenance to provide each area with its own maintenance force. The decentralized units may report to a single maintenance manager, but they are primarily responsible for maintenance in their assigned areas. The units may even report to an operations manager. Either of these variations may coincide with each individual on the crew being responsible for a particular machine. All in the name of ownership, management feels these decentralized maintenance resources are more interested in the areas they "own." &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The problem with decentralizing into more ownership is a tangible decline in productivity. Yes, the decentralized maintenance workforce more quickly addresses the urgent work than does the centralized force. Yet, decentralized groups show less interest in scheduling work in advance and are more difficult to steer away from doing reactive work. However, we must complete that lower-priority work to head off reactive work. Hence, the need for schedules. Schedules drive productivity in maintenance through goal setting. Some companies employ a hybrid organization where a centralized force does much of the work while areas still have their own smaller maintenance resources to respond to urgent work. Even so, the smaller decentralized units exhibit low productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Doc_Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200811_Doc_Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1. Centralized maintenance (big circle at left) vs. decentralized (smaller circles). &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second principle of scheduling squarely addresses this issue. It states that schedules and priorities are important. This seemingly simple statement carries much meaning. Centralized maintenance naturally values schedules, while decentralized maintenance values priorities. Company management must employ a system that drives both values, whether centralized or not. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We oversimplify the solution by attempting to make centralized maintenance view operations as its customer or by thinking that the ownership inherent in decentralized maintenance completes enough work to maintain assets properly. Both of these notions imply that the productivity that comes from scheduling is unnecessary. Yet, it is necessary. We need to accomplish enough work. In fact, while most companies do a good job with specializing, they don't do a very good job coordinating specialized groups. Another way of saying this is that most of our improvement opportunities deal with the interfaces between groups. The proper planning and scheduling system deals with maintenance and operations as partners. Balancing schedules and priorities provides coordination between maintenance and operations. Scheduling drives maintenance productivity by setting goals. A proper priority system drives scheduling the proper work. In addition, proper priorities dictate that sometimes we should break the schedule. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Together, schedules and priorities help maintenance, whether the group is centralized or not. Absolutely, formal maintenance planning and scheduling helps the decentralized maintenance workforce. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=authorbio&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility.

            <title>Deming, Drucker and a case for planning and scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A case for a structured planning approach revolves around W. Edwards Deming's work in the 1950s and Peter Drucker's work in the 1960s. America initially rejected Deming, who then became the force behind Japan's colossal turnaround into a world industry leader. America reveres Drucker as fostering the Management by Objective (MBO) movement. Maintenance work involves working on the same equipment repeatedly, so that obviously lends itself to Deming's teachings of continuous improvement. Maintenance also inherently offers opportunities for goals, meaning Drucker's work applies to better maintenance success. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The appropriate structure for planning work is a cycle of continuous improvement. A planner reviews feedback from previous maintenance work and makes improvements to existing plans for the next time. This opportunity exists for every piece of equipment. The only requirement for a company to implement this system is to provide a planner that looks at jobs before they start and applies previous learning from past jobs on the same equipment. Most companies don't employ such a system and instead expect planners to provide perfect plans at the start of any maintenance job. This errant expectation frustrates planners and maintenance technicians alike. In many systems, companies also expect planners to help with jobs-in-progress, finding parts and information. Such tasks usually distract or preempt planners from spending sufficient time on organizing feedback or otherwise planning jobs not yet started. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The goal nature of maintenance work resides in determining how much work maintenance crews should accomplish on a weekly basis. Simply providing enough jobs to fill the expected available labor hours sufficiently sets an adequate goal to boost maintenance productivity. Yet, most crews don't set such formal goals each week and instead rely on a sense of resolving all reactive work each week and perhaps performing some preventive maintenance (PM) work. This latter method typically doesn't sufficiently fill the available labor hours, although it does satisfy immediate visible maintenance needs. So-called wrench time studies provide the proof of this underutilization of resources, showing only 25 to 35 percent average time spent on direct work for techs available to supervisors for entire shifts. Companies with formal weekly scheduling systems should have wrench time in the 45 to 55 percent range, a major improvement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A good question remains: What is the purpose of improving maintenance utilization? It's not to lay off "extra" people. Most crews have backlogs of low-priority proactive work that should head off future reactive work. The plant ideally should have little or no reactive work. In such conditions, a crew should perform PM or other proactive work almost exclusively. By definition, the existence of reactive work means the plant has significant proactive work it isn't accomplishing, whether it is identified or not. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The proof that planning and scheduling helps is intuitive from a review of Deming and Drucker, but is also seen in real-world examples. Other than my own plant, where I saw a 60 percent increase in work order completion and the total elimination of a large backlog of work orders, I've seen other plants achieve success. A chemical plant raised its wrench time from 35 to 42 percent, a 20 percent improvement in workforce utilization. This means that every 10 employees were performing the work of 12. Yet, success isn't simply in wrench time. Wrench time implies that we accomplish more work by spending more time on tools, but we also need to see more physical work completion. More work completion with the same resources should improve plant performance. (Note: This implies a caveat that the plant has other programs identifying proactive work. Planning was never intended to be the lone "silver bullet".) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Two adequate examples of this extra work completion come from a building maintenance crew and an electrical wastewater maintenance crew. The first company had a building maintenance crew that never completed all of its PMs, but always completed all of its reactive calls. Upon formally scheduling the PMs that should be done each week, the workforce was able to complete all of its reactive calls plus the assigned PMs. The second company's wastewater maintenance crew simply found that its backlog had disappeared after implementing formal planning and scheduling. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These examples illustrate that planning and scheduling make an impact by accomplishing more maintenance work and better utilizing resources. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>'Ja, maar' mentality can hurt planning</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;While working this April in Holland, I saw a plant utilizing a marvelous Dutch phrase: "Ja, maar", which means "Yes, but ..." Seeing it first-hand helps me understand a principle of successful planning. Many plants can't implement successful planning because they assign the planners many worthwhile activities that are not planning. "Yes, planning is supposed to really help us, but we need the planner to do this other thing that really helps us." Ja, maar. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What is planning? Planning establishes initial job plans for maintenance work and improves these plans over time using feedback. The craft and time estimates allow scheduling a goal of work for each week matching available crew labor hours. This goal greatly improves productivity. Thus, planning provides a huge boost to crew productivity through helping better coordinate maintenance work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200807_Doc01.gif"&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. When utilized correctly, planners improve effectiveness over time. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The caveat, of course, is that a plant can only realize the benefit of planning if it allows planners to plan. Many plants create and staff a planner position and find the planner to be the ideal person to do a variety of activities helpful to maintenance. These activities do indeed help maintenance improve. Yet, they aren't planning activities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Consider the typical curve of improving maintenance effectiveness with a planner (Figure 1). A plant takes a competent craftsperson out of the workforce to staff a planner position. Area A illustrates the workforce losing overall effectiveness because it has lost a resource. Yet, the new planner soon develops considerable skill in utilizing the plant's CMMS, purchasing bureaucracy and inventory system. Mechanics on the crews leverage the planner's ability to find information and help them more quickly resolve problems for jobs they already have in progress. Yet, this workforce improvement can only go so high, as Area C shows. Furthermore, using planners to help resolve problems for in-progress jobs is not even planning. I call the principal activity of planners in this area "Chasing Parts" because they typically help craftspersons find and procure spare parts not identified in advance on a job plan. Many of those in-progress problems aren't even new. They are reoccurrences of typical problems encountered on those particular machines. This leads to the need for planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By considering past maintenance activities on particular machines, planners can plan to avoid specific problems previously encountered - but only if they are allowed time to plan. It takes time to file job feedback and improve job plans. It takes time to figure out plans for work not yet begun. If planners can plan, they can take the organization to levels of effectiveness indicated by Area E. I call this area "Planning Future Work" because the primary duty of the planner should be to head off problems, not help resolve them as they occur. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My main intent in this article is to shed some light on Area B. The chasing parts activity is worthwhile. It does help accomplish work more effectively. We do need to resolve problems as they occur on jobs in progress. Other activities that management might assign planners also help improve maintenance effectiveness. These might include substituting for supervisors on vacation, participating on root cause teams, researching ideas for new equipment modifications, supervising contractors or even writing follow-up work requests from PM inspections. Yet, they sidetrack good planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is why planning has a hard time getting off the ground. When planners try to plan future work, they have no time. "Ja, maar" strikes. "Yes, but" the other activities are important. Area D even shows an initial dip in overall effectiveness if the planners were to stop chasing parts to concentrate on planning future work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management must decide if it wants to do planning or not. If other activities are important, assign other resources to accomplish them, not the planners. A plant can't achieve the higher levels of performance without planners planning. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Best ways to kill planning, scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;Two ways to kill a planning and scheduling system dwarf all other methods. Be careful with these two schemes. They will make everyone either mad or frustrated. They will also leave management bewildered after it puts them into play. These methods are the perfect job plan and schedule compliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first method, the perfect job plan, is easy to implement and usually wounds all players, leaving nothing in place for use of the second strategy. Management simply proclaims loudly to the mechanics, "Now that we have maintenance planning, no mechanics will ever have to waste time looking for parts or other information because the planner will have provided a job plan for each job." Simple, huh? Of course, we know this is impossible, as do the planners and mechanics. Management also knows this is impossible. That's why it implemented the strategy - to ensure planning dies a slow, lingering death. The whole thing is so subtle that it boggles the mind. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management has been to management training and knows all about W. Edwards Deming. Back in the 1950s, Deming explained the Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle. Nothing is simply Plan Execute. You see how clever the whole thing is. Simply proclaiming that planners will provide perfect job plans sounds good enough to make everyone forget Deming. Deming who? It works! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the proclamation in place, sickness sets in. Planners sweat. They know they could never provide a perfect plan, but that is their very job, to provide the impossible. Fever mounts as mechanics arrive in droves to "help" the planners. One mechanic says, "You gave me a wrong part number. It's only right that I give you a chance to correct your error." Another mechanic interjects, "Wait a minute. The planner is already correcting the silly time estimate assigned to my work order." The fever approaches 102 degrees. Soon, woozy planners must abandon even feeble attempts to plan future work. Instead, they focus on helping these desperate mechanics who couldn't otherwise complete their in-progress jobs. The disease advances as mechanics run out of planned work. Planners conditioned to help jobs in progress continue aiding such jobs. It's their purpose in life, but planning dies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What is this? Some planners escaped the plague? You say they realize that planners can never plan perfect jobs so they have set out to collect feedback to improve future jobs? You say that they resist mechanics seeking in-progress help? Phooey. We must implement the second strategy, schedule compliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Facing an enlightened planning group, management turns its attention to the maintenance supervisors to kill the planning and scheduling program. Management ties supervisor pay to schedule compliance. Nothing to it. Easy as pie. Planning and scheduling will die. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The schedule compliance strategy is more insidious than the perfect plan weapon. It counts on no one knowing that schedule compliance is a measure of our control over plant equipment, not our control over plant supervisors. Now, you and I both know that schedule compliance is the ultimate indicator of plant proactivity. It tells us whether the plant is working on us or if we are working on the plant. But, management knows that compliance sounds like a supervisor control indicator, so it slips it in. Diabolical! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tying supervisor pay to schedule compliance makes the supervisor cringe whenever a hiccup causes an emergency work order. The supervisor must then decide whether to help the plant by breaking the weekly schedule or to help his own family by adhering to the weekly schedule. Unable to sleep at night, the supervisor achieves a record stress level. Supervisors, the keepers of the plant culture, now bad-mouth planning and scheduling, seeking every opportunity to scuttle the ship. Management gloats. As long as management doesn't reveal its Peter Drucker teachings from the 1960s, planning and scheduling will soon die! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What's that? Someone revealed that Drucker's Management by Objective allows for not achieving goals? It's true. As long as we set the weekly schedule as a goal and allow for breaking the schedule, supervisors accept the schedule. These modern supervisors enjoy having a target of work they should do. They enjoy having a culled backlog service. They enjoy the increased control they wield using planned jobs with craft and hour estimates. They complete more work than a crew without planning and scheduling. Resistance to pestilence. Unbelievable! 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Schedule success drives behavior</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Let's continue our discussion on the principles that guide world-class planning and scheduling. This article covers the application of schedule compliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, we use the term "schedule success" to discuss "schedule compliance." Why does this make a difference? "Compliance" makes it sound like supervisors are responsible for whether or not they comply with the schedule. It makes it sound like they could increase schedule compliance simply by sticking to their guns and doing the scheduled work. Companies go so far as to tie supervisor pay to schedule compliance to show their strong support. Instead of "compliance," this leads to "stress" and supervisors with ulcers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Place yourself into the role of a supervisor whose pay is tied to schedule compliance. You are working away through the week when a plant emergency occurs. You need to take your entire crew to head this one off and bring the plant back on line. Let's go. No! Wait just a minute. You now realize that if you drop the scheduled work to meet this emergency, it's going to cost you in the pocket at year end when they figure raises or bonuses. Helping the plant get back on its feet will cost your family money. What a choice. A good supervisor will honor the needs of the plant but eventually despise the management. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Measuring schedule performance with "schedule success" places an entirely different connotation on the whole situation. We all want the schedule to succeed, but if a plant emergency occurs, obviously that takes immediate priority at the expense of the schedule. It's not necessarily the fault of the supervisors if they don't comply with the schedule. It's necessary for a supervisor to break the schedule for work that can't wait. We rely on the skill of the supervisors in correctly judging when to break the schedule, not on their skill of ignoring urgent plant conditions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Second, what is a good schedule success score? This is a trick question because if you aren't careful, it will lead you back to thinking of compliance and not success. John Crosson (a Clorox leader who spoke at the 1997 SMRP conference) says that schedule success is the "ultimate measure of proactivity". In other words, is the plant telling you what to do or are you telling the plant what to do? Low schedule success usually means that things are breaking more than it tells you that supervisors aren't working hard enough. High schedule success usually means that you are working on the correct things to keep breakdowns from occurring in the first place. The schedule success score is more of a measure of how decrepit your equipment is and if you are doing the right things to improve them or keep them in shape rather than getting enough work done. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With this said, I'd be perfectly happy in many plants with a schedule success of only 60 to 70 percent, or even much lower. Regardless of the score, the practice of scheduling leads to more work completion than otherwise, even while reacting to emergencies. We can't dictate that emergencies not occur, but we can make the best use of the remaining time and not encourage sitting back on laurels after fixing emergencies. Now, don't go and say "Doc said we should have 60 to 70 percent schedule success and tie supervisor pay to it". Your schedule success is determined by the current condition of your plant equipment, not the willingness of supervisors to forego pay raises. Your plant is what it is. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Third, and at most a minor issue, how should you measure schedule success? I've seen it measured many ways. I have little preference. I like to measure it in such a way to give supervisors the benefit of the doubt. I like to measure job starts and give supervisors credit for all estimated hours for any job on the schedule that they even start. For example, we give a crew 1,000 hours worth of work and they start jobs with estimated hours totaling 850. The schedule success is 85 percent. It doesn't matter that several of the jobs started weren't yet completed. You see, we know that many jobs stay in the backlog forever, but maintenance crews complete them as soon as possible after they finally start them. Maintenance typically doesn't leave jobs lying around half completed. So, our concern is to get jobs started. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I've seen equally good results simply using jobs instead of hours (e.g. I scheduled 30 jobs and you started 20 for a success of 67 percent). I've also seen success using job completions; but beware, this can lead to problems. It's frustrating to supervisors who complete most of a large job, only to get dinged if the job still has an hour or so left for the following week. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Also, if the plant has a complicated CMMS step that could delay recording the job's completion, this could lead to disparaging the scheduling measurement effort. Be especially wary of using paperwork completion as a condition. I've seen a few plants that have considerable computer entry requirements involving other groups getting around to the paperwork. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, I really don't like giving partial credit for jobs. Take, for example, a job planned for 20 hours where the crew only completes 12 hours by the end of the week. The partial credit concept gives the crew credit for only the 12 hours. In practice, this partial credit idea quickly becomes very complicated. It requires checking on the partial status of every job (time consuming) and also presumes that there are only eight hours left anyway. In reality, the uncertainty of individual job time estimates might mean there are actually 30 hours or two hours left on the job planned for 20 hours. In the case of 30 hours left, why is it appropriate to give the crew credit for completing over half the work? In the case of only two hours left, the crew really should be given credit for much more work on the job. These are academic exercises at best and don't support our real purpose. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What is our real purpose in measuring schedule performance anyway? It isn't to see if the work got done. From a maintenance planning and scheduling standpoint, we measure schedule success to insure other good behavior to achieve our real purpose - namely, completing more work. Measuring success drives the fundamental practices of planning and scheduling, which is what gets more work done. You can't measure schedule success if you aren't doing weekly scheduling. And, you can't do weekly scheduling if you aren't planning work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From a maintenance and reliability management standpoint, we measure schedule success to gain an indication of the reliability of the plant equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can we get through the week reliably without emergencies? With all the different aspects of proper maintenance working together, we can. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Crew supervisors rule daily schedule</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;My preceding &lt;I&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/I&gt; columns presented the six principles of planning and then started presenting the six principles of scheduling, now to arrive at the fifth scheduling principle. These principles have built onto each other, finally arriving in the last column at the creation of the weekly schedule. Nevertheless, each principle points out concepts that can help any planning organization on its own. This is even truer of the fifth principle, which states that the planning group does not create the daily schedule. How about that? The planners aren't involved with the daily schedule. More precisely, this principle gives control of the daily schedule to the crew supervisor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This transfer of responsibility is primarily due to the uncertain nature of individual job estimates made by the planners. Maintenance work isn't assembly line work where industrial standards for motion and actions can precisely determine time estimates for individual work orders. Many maintenance jobs on specific equipment are performed less than a single time per year and rarely by the same craftsperson. Even by moving each job up its own learning curve with a good file system, I still claim that "job estimates are only plus or minus 100 percent accurate." A job estimated to be four hours long actually might be worked in as little as one to two hours or take as long as eight hours. (Anyone who has ever worked on his or her own car might agree with this.) Even so, the estimates have a very even distribution of accuracy, and a week's worth of work typically averages out to be only 10 percent off in accuracy overall. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The application of these accuracies means the planning group can put together a simple list of work orders as a weekly schedule, but the daily schedule itself must be managed each day. The planners must work in the future while the daily scheduling activity must be managed in the present. Daily scheduling isn't a planner function. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To illustrate this point, consider the first day of a typical work week (say Monday). The crew supervisor used the estimated times of jobs in the weekly schedule list to create a daily schedule for individual crafts personnel. However, by the middle of the day, the supervisor notes that some of the jobs that should be finished today look like they will require some extra time tomorrow. The supervisor also observes that two jobs that were supposed to take all day are almost complete. What's more, the supervisor decides to interrupt a lower-priority job for a new urgent task that operations insists can't wait until tomorrow. The supervisor does have some success by gaining an operator agreement that another crisis could wait until later in the week. Thus, the creator of Tuesday's schedule must be aware of what is going on with today's schedule. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the perfect assignment for the supervisor, who should be in the field most of the day. This isn't so with the planner, who should be in the office most of the day creating future work plans. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, remember that the planning function is to help the supervisor, not take away all supervisor duties. In addition to daily scheduling being a supervisor task, assigning names is clearly a supervisor responsibility. The supervisor knows who called in sick today. The supervisor knows who the best person is for this pump job. The supervisor knows who needs more experience with fans and should be assigned to that job. The supervisor knows who works best with whom and, vice versa, who to keep apart from whom. (Ah, we cannot escape the human element.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Along with creating the daily schedule, the supervisor must also manage the daily schedule in respect to equipment work permits. Requesting equipment clearances from operations on a daily basis requires precise knowledge of when the crew will be available to work, so coordinating clearances also falls best to the supervisor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, to emphasize the point, it's the supervisor's responsibility to react to true emergencies even to the extent of rescheduling the entire crew and forsaking the daily schedule, if necessary. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Go, supervisors! These people are critical to our maintenance success. Don't try to eliminate them with planners. Instead, provide them with role clarity in the planning strategy. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Week is enough for advance schedule</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The key period for advance scheduling of routine maintenance is only a single week. This does not mean that the plant engineers and managers do not have longer-term projects under way and are not looking at maintenance strategy several months or years in advance. It also does not mean that the plant does not plan lengthy shutdowns in great detail. But after the glory of the shutdown fades, plants need to consider productivity of routine, day-in and day-out maintenance. Down in the trenches, where the crews, supervisors and planners live, a single week is all that it takes to control productivity of routine maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As in most walks of life, setting goals helps achieve results. In routine maintenance, plants tend not to give this enough attention as long as maintenance seems responsive to urgent plant needs. They do not have a clear goal of maintenance productivity. Unfortunately, management noticing only maintenance responsiveness leads to maintenance organizing its efforts around quick repairs and not preventing problems in the first place. Fortunately, maintenance usually has excess capacity in its staffing to handle the emergency work and much of the proactive work to head off problems. The plant simply has to set a goal of work to help maintenance focus on completing more proactive work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As it turns out, setting a goal of a week's worth of work for each maintenance crew provides an astonishing increase in productivity. One wastewater plant reported that its electrical backlog "disappeared" after starting weekly scheduling. A group maintaining buildings found it could do all of the usual reactive work plus its preventive maintenance tasks after they set a goal for the week. A seasoned crew supervisor at a power station exclaimed that he now understood his job in terms of completing work orders instead of simply waiting for operations to call with problems. These wonderful results are not due to brilliant new ways of managing maintenance. Instead, they are due to simply setting a goal. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The goal of maintenance work is set at one week for several reasons. First of all, a single week is short enough to allow supervisors to protect the schedule somewhat. Many new work orders might be able to wait a week, but far fewer could be put off for several weeks. Second, a single week is short enough to provide a reasonable goal. If the schedule were, say, three weeks of work, what is the difference between three weeks of work and the whole backlog? A goal that is too large is meaningless and tantamount to saying "We need to get busy." On the other hand, a single week is long enough to dampen out the effect of inaccurate job plan estimates. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance is not routine assembly-line work where hours can be estimated with great precision. A simple job estimated for three hours might take all day while another job estimated for a whole day might be finished before lunch. Fortunately, as many jobs exceed their estimates, other jobs will take less time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A week's worth of work for a whole crew generally has great overall accuracy in the sum of the work order actual vs. estimated hours. There are enough jobs, so the inaccuracies of individual estimates cancel out each other. A week is long enough to provide a reasonably estimated goal of work. In addition, a week is long enough to include preventive maintenance tasks and other proactive maintenance activities in the goal. It is easier to skip this proactive work if only scheduling day to day. Similarly, a week is long enough to consider scheduling lower-priority work with higher-priority work for the same equipment. This is also harder to accomplish if only scheduling day to day. Thus, the one-week time period strikes a good balance between the advantages of shorter and longer advance schedules. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The form of the advance schedule is as uncomplicated as the concept of the goal. An advance schedule is a simple list of work orders. The advance schedule dictates neither the day nor the person the crew will use to work each work order in the following week. As simple as this list is, it provides the needed goal that produces an impressive boost in maintenance productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As simple as it sounds, it cannot be emphasized enough that the great productivity boost from planning and scheduling comes from the goal provided by the weekly schedule. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Is It OK to break the schedule?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In my previous columns, I've outlined the overall benefits of planning and scheduling as well as my six principles that make planning "work." The past two columns explained scheduling as a specific element needed for productivity and identified the first principle of scheduling, needing a planned backlog. In this issue, we move on to the second of my six principles of scheduling. This principle states that both the schedule itself and the priorities of individual work orders are important. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The statement "schedules and priorities are important" seems so obvious; it's almost overkill to include it as a principle. Nevertheless, planning and scheduling isn't rocket science. It's mostly putting together a framework of commonsense ideas. Let us review why productivity suffers at the feet of these issues. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance provides operations with equipment that operates. However, when equipment breaks, maintenance swings into its secondary role to restore equipment into service. Unfortunately, many maintenance forces (as well as the operations groups) see restoration as the primary maintenance role. This perception leads to some bad behaviors. First, maintenance generally rushes to respond to urgent maintenance work - the visible work of which everyone is aware - but never seems to start much of the lower-priority work that might head off later urgent work. Many plants have enough visible work to make maintenance feel productive (or at least effective). Second, the operations personnel feel that there are only three true maintenance priorities: "Now, Tomorrow or Never." Therefore, to get anything done, operators believe they must declare a false urgency or not bother reporting something at all until later, when it becomes really urgent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In reality, the maintenance forces do have some extra time on their hands after urgent work. Yet, if they were to work on lower-priority jobs, urgent work arises and interrupts them. This further discourages maintenance from beginning lower-priority work. Overall, productivity suffers because there is usually not that much visible work to keep everyone busy all the time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Scheduling as a process encourages maintenance to begin lower-priority jobs to do "enough" work. This goal of work created by a schedule is the key to productivity. Furthermore, we can advance productivity if we can avoid job interruptions. This avoidance depends on operations not declaring false emergencies. If we can put off a new job until next week, we can include it in next week's work schedule and help us meet our goal of work this week. If we can put off a new job until tomorrow (or later in the week), we can avoid interrupting today's schedule, which has given each individual technician a goal of work. If we can put off a new job until this afternoon, we can at least have a planner look at the job and see if we can develop a scope and a parts list to give the technician a head start. We can also provide the supervisor with craft skills and time estimates to allow work control. If we can put off a new job until we at least finish completing a current job-in-progress, we can avoid interrupting that low-priority job we finally started. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To have operations avoid declaring false emergencies, management needs to emphasize the importance of the schedule and the priority system. Management needs to have the maintenance crews start each week with a goal of work. Management also needs to empower crew supervisors to challenge the priority of new work to protect their schedules. When presented with a new "emergency," the crew supervisor asks the operator how long it can wait and then works it into the schedule as appropriate. Of course, if the new work can't wait, management must allow crews to respond. It is OK to break the schedule for the proper priority work. Finally, management needs to encourage operations to report that lower-priority work without delay. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With all of this said, once maintenance productivity increases by working to a weekly schedule, the fear of lower-priority work never getting done greatly decreases and abuse of the priority system lessens. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Experience shows that starting each crew with a week's worth of work (schedules are important) and allowing supervisors to interrupt these schedules (priorities are important) greatly increase productivity for completing not only more maintenance work, but the right maintenance work. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Scheduling needs a planned backlog</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Having a formal scheduling method should improve wrench time dramatically. Formal scheduling answers the question &amp;quot;How much work should we do next week?&amp;quot; Scheduling is a matter of control. The responsibilities of management can be divided into Plan, Organize, Staff, Direct and Control. Unfortunately, as with most management, maintenance management does a much poorer job with the responsibility of control than with its other areas of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The notion of control simply means comparing one&amp;#39;s performance against a standard and making adjustments, if needed. In maintenance, we&amp;#39;ve abdicated this responsibility by not having a standard for productivity. We have expected &amp;quot;craft persons to work hard to keep the plant running and keep the backlog under control.&amp;quot; This expectation is somewhat of a standard for quality, but worthless for productivity. Nearly everyone on the site knows whether we are doing a good job with plant availability, a quality standard. Indeed, we would rather have everyone sit around and the plant run than everyone be running around and the plant sit unavailable. Nevertheless, after quality, productivity must be addressed. First effectiveness, then efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Making a schedule for &amp;quot;How much work should we do next week?&amp;quot; provides an excellent and easy-to-use standard for productivity. The schedule figures how much work we should complete and then compares this quantity against the amount of work we actually complete. Companies can make this schedule creation and comparison easy or extremely complicated. Many maintenance organizations that advance beyond planning to scheduling falter here when they make their scheduling too complex. This column and the next few will discuss the proper principles to prepare and use a schedule as a control standard to improve maintenance productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first scheduling principle is the prerequisite of having a planned backlog. Maintenance planning supports maintenance scheduling by providing estimates of job hours and craft skill levels required for every work order. Planners must stay ahead of the crafts by planning enough work to provide a week&amp;#39;s worth of work for scheduling. Typically, by adjusting the level of detail poured into job plans as more or fewer work orders come into maintenance, planners can plan nearly the entire backlog on an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The estimated hours planned on work orders are entirely adequate for advance scheduling. Interestingly enough, this is in spite of the time estimates not being very accurate on individual jobs due to the nature of maintenance. A &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; job planned for half a day might run into problems with rusted bolts or who knows what and take all day. On the other hand, many times technicians complete these same jobs in an hour or two. Maintenance is simply not as easily estimated as assembly line work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nonetheless, these actual hours vs. estimates have a very normal distribution (statistically speaking), and a stack of work orders encompassing a week&amp;#39;s worth of work for a crew gives a very accurate estimate. The bottom line we need to understand is that the actual hours worked for a 10-person crew on 400 hours of planned work might be accurate to within 10 percent of the job plan estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to simply having the hour estimates, the planner must identify these hours by lowest qualified craft skill level. Instead of simply &amp;quot;20 hours,&amp;quot; the estimate states &amp;quot;10 hours for mechanic, 10 hours for helper.&amp;quot; This allows the schedule to know which crafts to assign in the scheduling process. Furthermore, note the crafts identified in this example are not &amp;quot;two mechanics for 10 hours each,&amp;quot; even though this is a mechanical job. By identifying one of the craft persons as a &amp;quot;helper,&amp;quot; the planner gives the scheduler and crew supervisor the flexibility by allowing anyone to be the second person on the job. If the scheduler came to the point of including the job and only had a mechanic and a welder left as a resource, yes, the welder could be the helper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first principle of scheduling simply states that maintenance plans must contain planned estimated hours for the lowest-needed craft skills. Well, I must admit that, so far, this is pretty simple. I&amp;#39;ve been told that having written the industry handbook on planning and having talked exhaustively about it for more than 13 years, we should expect a little rocket science. Sorry. While predictive maintenance might be high tech and high value, planning and scheduling remains low tech and high value. Rest assured, though, that it is high value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This first principle is the first part of the framework we are establishing to build an advance schedule. We&amp;#39;ll then use this schedule as a productivity standard to dramatically improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The need for scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;Why do we need formal scheduling? This is a legitimate question. If we have already established a maintenance planning process, shouldn't we have reduced job delays? Shouldn't we have gradually found out the tools and materials required by most equipment jobs? Shouldn't jobs with planned time estimates insure that craft personnel don't spend too much time on jobs? Why do we need to invest the additional time and effort to create a formal maintenance schedule? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, simply having maintenance planning without scheduling does not increase wrench time (time spent actually on jobs in the field). Delays occur not only during jobs, but between jobs as well. Planning an individual job to have the proper skills, instructions, materials and tools helps reduce delays during the execution of that job, but does not directly reduce any delays between jobs. You would think that if craft personnel execute individual jobs more quickly, they would execute more jobs overall. Nonetheless, actual experience shows that even with planning, wrench time does not improve much without formal scheduling. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Several main keys help explain this phenomenon. These keys involve the past experience of assigning work, the lure of urgent work and inadequate assignment methods. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, many plants come from a background of having poor storerooms, inadequate bills of equipment, and little, if any, formally planned work. Supervisors under these circumstances developed experience knowing how many jobs a person might reasonably accomplish in a day. Against the obstacles of obtaining parts and other problems, it might take all day long to finish only one or two maintenance jobs. However, with improved storerooms, planning and other maintenance aids, we often find these supervisors still relying on their past experience and only assigning one or two jobs each day. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Second, the culture of maintenance remains in many plants to resolve plant emergencies and urgent work only. There is never much pressure to work the non-urgent maintenance tasks diligently to keep ahead of minor problems. These plants frequently have large backlogs of low-priority work, and the operators feel that maintenance assigns hidden priorities of "now, tomorrow or never." These plants see delays between jobs after they complete the emergency work. Even in plants that do not think they are merely doing urgent work, there is often a mind-set of not really having that much other work or a reluctance to assign yet another low-priority job after the troops have victoriously conquered the latest emergency. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Third, the true assignment practices in many places are heavily drawn toward either assigning one job at a time with the expectation that the craft personnel will come back for another job when finished or not assigning specific jobs at all with a misapplication of the notion of empowerment. Assigning a single job at a time ensures that peer pressure will wreak havoc with productivity. People who consistently finish jobs on time and go back for more work subject themselves to ridicule from slower people. At best, the most conscientious people are resentful that they do more work than others. In addition, never knowing what "the next job" will be stirs the imagination that the next job will be a worse job that the one in hand, which encourages slowing down. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many plants have also taken empowerment to the extreme of allowing technicians to pick what they should be working on altogether. This practice brings out the worst of the second point about tackling only reactive work. We would be better off from a productivity standpoint telling the technicians what their assignments are and then empowering them to execute that work. These factors of relying too much on past experience to assign work, primarily focusing on reactive work and other inadequate assignment methods, work as powerful agents to keep wrench time low, even at plants with maintenance planning functions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fortunately, with this information guiding us, we see that we need some method to determine how much work we should execute. This method is formal scheduling. Instead of the question being, "Why do we need formal scheduling?" the question should be "How much work should we do next week?" The answer is best determined by having a formal scheduling method if we want to improve wrench time dramatically. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Making sense of wrench time totals</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;After rambling on in the last column about what wrench time is and how to measure it, I want to reinforce how hard it is to believe wrench time could be so low. The more we understand how hard it is to believe, the more we see why the opportunity is hidden. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Thirty-five percent is a typical wrench time for a maintenance workforce. Many managers find it hard to believe that a workforce's productivity could be so low. Some time ago, Danny Mallard provided me with a numerical scenario of how hard it seems it would be to intentionally try to achieve a wrench time as low as 35 percent. Mallard is a maintenance manager at Jacksonville Electric Authority's Northside Generating Station, an electric power plant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Consider an average technician throughout an average day (Figure 1). Beginning a 10-hour maintenance shift, the technician first took 30 minutes to get started in the morning. This was essentially a check-in time where the crew met and the technician had a cup of coffee or two. The supervisor gave the technician several assignments and then the technician got busy. Yet, during the course of the day, the technician came back several times to the supervisor for various instructions and to clarify a point or two on the work. This time, receiving instructions took a total of 45 minutes. In addition, the technician spent 30 minutes during the day waiting at the tool room to check out some special tools. The technician also spent 30 minutes waiting at the storeroom obtaining parts. To move around the plant site, the technician spent 45 minutes of the day traveling. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So far, these times might not seem too unreasonable, but next consider breaks, lunch and check-out times. Instead of two 15-minute breaks, the technician took a total of 90 minutes in breaks (a whole extra hour) and 30 extra minutes for lunch. The technician also took 90 minutes for showering and otherwise preparing to go home at the end of the day. With all this wasted time (390 minutes), the technician had only 210 minutes left out of the 10-hour shift (600 minutes) for work. This time arrangement netted the technician a 35 percent wrench time and 65 percent delay time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can you believe it? Does it hit too close to home? The technician seems to have gone out of his way to avoid wrench time and still achieves what is thought to be an industry average rate. Incredible as it seems, the typical wrench time reported in industry ranges between 25 and 35 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While some technicians at each plant are in more productive situations than others, studies show that overall productivity measurements are in this range. A few minutes here and there add up to a productivity problem with significant delays. In spite of the notion that wrench time could not possibly be so low, Mallard's plant conducted a wrench time study and found the average wrench time to be . . . 35 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So, we see that the reality of wrench time can be surprising and yields an opportunity for improvement. Effective planning and scheduling addresses this opportunity in maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Doc_Figure1.gif src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200703_Doc_Figure1.gif"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. Is this really an 'extreme' scenario of delays? &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The what, why, how of wrench time</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Let us share a few words about wrench time: What is it? Why is it important? And, how do we measure it? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;W&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;hat is wrench time?&lt;/B&gt; Wrench time is a measure of crafts personnel at work, using tools, in front of jobs. Wrench time does not include obtaining parts, tools or instructions, or the travel associated with those tasks. It does not include traveling to or from jobs. It does not include time spent obtaining work assignments. Obviously, it does not include break time. These non-wrench time tasks are often necessary to get work done, but are not "wrench time." The craftsperson is in a delay situation. We should also ask ourselves whether the crafts personnel perform tasks efficiently while they are on tools in front of jobs. This is a legitimate question, but not answered by wrench time. Nonetheless, if we increase the time employees are "on the job," we should get more work done. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition, planning should increase the efficiency of a craftsperson while on a job if the plan provides helpful instructions and provides a time standard for a good technician performing the expected work without unanticipated delays. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To define something as wrench time or not, I find it helpful to consider what I would be willing to pay for if I hired someone to do a job. Would I be willing to pay for someone getting a part? No, I would have wanted them to have that part available to begin with. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Why is wrench time important?&lt;/B&gt; Industry experience shows that typical workforce wrench time is between 25 and 35 percent. Planning and scheduling can help raise this rate above 50 percent. One of my earlier &lt;I&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/I&gt; columns stated what this means in monetary terms. For now, accept that increasing a workforce at 25 percent up to 50 percent would double the labor. A 30-person workforce would perform the work of 60 people. You can see this is a vital issue. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My sixth principle of planning states that wrench time is the primary measure of planning and scheduling effectiveness. The purpose of planning and scheduling is to increase productivity. It's not to prepare job plans or operate the CMMS. Planners might prepare job plans or operate the CMMS, but that's not the purpose of planning. The job plans and CMMS help the planners in their goal to increase productivity. Wrench time best measures this productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;How do we measure wrench time?&lt;/B&gt; Before we discuss how to measure wrench time, let me first say that formally measuring wrench time isn't a requirement to implement helpful planning and scheduling. Wrench time studies are easily seen as obtrusive and heavy-handed. Implementing a fundamentally sound system that plans most of the work and schedules each crew with a weekly goal of work improves wrench time whether it is measured or not. In addition, the metric of work orders completed per month shows a dramatic increase when the scheduling effort takes off. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nonetheless, plants can measure wrench time in-house with reasonable accuracy with a limited number of days and in a manner acceptable to crafts personnel. First, use an agreeable, in-house supervisor as the observer who knows everyone. This avoids putting numbers on hats or other perceived demeaning methods to identify people. Second, announce the study ahead of time to the crafts during breaks or other convenient settings. Frame the observations as finding out what delays are hindering work, not as measuring whether people are lazy. Third, use a sampling method, sequential or random, to insure each person has an equal chance of selection. Fourth, five days of sampling two people each half-hour of an eight-hour shift produce accurate enough results to confirm a 35 percent wrench time with a plus or minus 7 percent accuracy. Often, this result makes the study worthwhile as the plant discovers it does not have 80 percent wrench time as commonly thought. Plus or minus 7 percent is also accurate to confirm a productivity increase. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A plant might move from a range of 28 to 42 percent to a range of 43 to 57 percent, a definite improvement. (Certain statistical tests also exist to confirm improvement even if the ranges overlapped.) In addition, a study would quantify delays such as parts, tools, instructions, traveling, etc. with better accuracy than plus or minus 7 percent because delay areas are smaller. E-mail me to receive a sample wrench time study that compares delay areas. If you just have to do a wrench time study, I'd recommend such a mini-study. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How much detail for job plans? </title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;This column continues the discussion of how many hours a planner should plan each week. In the final analysis, the planner must vary the level of detail in job plans in order to keep up with the backlog and stay ahead of the scheduling process. Thus, my fifth principle of planning states that plans recognize the skill of the crafts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Consider 10 jobs. The planner must not spend so much time planning three jobs that seven do not get planned at all. Those seven would not get the benefit of past learning because the planner never reviewed their files, and the scheduling process would have difficulty including them without time estimates or craft skills. We would rather have the planner plan all 10 jobs to support the scheduling process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Detailed procedures and checklists contribute to better reliability. Less is left to chance and technician memory. Yet, planners frequently do not have the time to plan thorough step-by-step procedures in time to support scheduling. The plant could use specially assigned personnel to develop the procedures for many common jobs. Even then, many maintenance jobs come up for the first time without a set procedure in the file. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To establish the proper level of detail within the constraint of planning most of the jobs, we should consider the type of work, the crafts personnel, supervisors and the repetitious nature of maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, the planner can select certain jobs to give more attention. Planners can give critical equipment and safety issues more detailed job information. Planners can also give more attention to special areas where confusion might result. Planners can include fewer detailed instructions for jobs involving inconsequential work or obvious work. For urgent work, the planner can write a job objective with few or no job steps while still providing labor estimates and craft skill requirements. Emergency work generally does not receive any planning, although planners can help such work-in-progress if requested. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Second, planners must specify the minimum level of craft skill for each job. If the job requires a top-level electrician, a lower-level electrician should not be planned. The planner should not include excessive job steps to explain the work to an unqualified craftsman or craftswoman. The plant should have practices in place to hire, train and keep qualified technicians for most maintenance work. Planning work orders does not replace proper staffing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Third, planning also counts on having qualified supervisors in the field to help with special problems and to guide the crafts personnel. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, the planning group counts on developing better procedures over time. The planners can't develop perfect procedures for jobs the first time. Not only is there not enough time, but the planner's expertise can never match the cumulative skill and experience of the 20 to 30 technicians in the field. Because the plant repeats maintenance over time, the planner can use feedback and files to gradually perfect job plans. A certain valve may require maintenance three times over five years. A different technician might work on the valve each time and suggest improvements to the job plan. The planner must be adept at filing and improving the job plan each time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The bottom line of how much detail a planner should put into a job is this: If the planners can't plan all backlog jobs in time to support the scheduling, they must put less detail into each plan. If the planners can plan all the jobs in time, they can go back and put more detail into some of them. The plant should put its emphasis on developing a system that perfects job plans over time. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SIDE_BAR_TEXT&gt;

            <title>Planned hours: What's a good total?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A few weeks ago, someone asked me, âHow many hours should a planner plan for each week?â This is a great question, but I can only give a touchy-feely answer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Iâm hesitant to push planners into a numerical-type standard or quota. But, letâs first try to analyze this in a quantitative manner. A single planner should be able to plan for 20 to 30 technicians. Therefore, a planner needs to stay ahead of at least 20 techs on an ongoing basis. As a minimum, there needs to be enough planned work available at the end of the week to enable scheduling for the next week. This could mean as much as 800 hours planned (20 techs times 40 hours per week). However, the plantâs preventive maintenance program also should be generating work orders that donât need advance planning. Presume the plant wants to spend 20 percent of hours on PM tasks. That subtracts 160 hours and suggests each planner should plan 640 hours of work per week. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A variable that would increase the weekly planning hours is if the planner had to plan for more than 20 techs. Variables that would lessen the hours would be: if some techs were on vacation, sick leave, in training or unavailable; and, if plant emergencies or urgent work caused the techs to forsake the schedule to do unplanned work. For simplification, letâs consider these factors are a wash and stick with 640 hours. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the same time, keep in mind that planners not only plan future work, but also review feedback on completed jobs in order to update job plans and file work orders. Thus, can a planner plan 640 hours of work each week while keeping up with job closeouts? Iâm not satisfied with this quantitative analysis. Iâd like every job to have someone look at it and examine the history file before any techs are assigned to the work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs proceed with a qualitative approach to planner productivity. There is no simple ânumber of hours plannedâ answer here. Consider first, the maintenance crews themselves. We want 20 techs (two crews of 10) completing 400 hours of work each week (minus carryovers, training or vacation). We donât want a crew slowing down or speeding up based on the outstanding backlog. This isnât the case with planners. If there is a low backlog, they could spend more time planning each individual job. But if thereâs a large unplanned backlog, itâs essential that they plan more work even if the plans arenât very precise. A simple scope, craft skill, labor hours and list of parts used last time, if any, may be all the planner has time to put on each plan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Iâd push the planners to complete more plans if the unplanned backlog became too high. Itâs essential that the scheduler be able to select jobs from the entire backlog even if some jobs only had rudimentary plans with hours. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The biggest improvement opportunity lies in scheduling. If I had to get quantitative, Iâd insist that the planners plan all the reactive work each day. Iâd look at the lower-priority proactive work in terms of some timeframe. For example, if the priority system dictated that crews complete Priority 3 jobs within two weeks, Iâd want the planners to aim for a target of five days. This allows a crew time to schedule the work after planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200609_Doc---Advisor-Fig-1.jpg" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This figure displays a traditional driver of productivity.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=296 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200609_Doc---Advisor-Fig-2.jpg" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;These last two figures show productivity driven by planning and&lt;BR&gt;scheduling.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A strict numerical approach to productivity might miss the point of why planners exist (to promote crew productivity). I want the planner to keep the unplanned backlog under control by adjusting the time spent on the level of detail put into each job plan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, Iâve worked with slower and faster planners. Some could only keep ahead of 10 techs while others could plan for as many as 60. These were all good planners. The key was to balance the planners and techs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All this information doesnât provide a precise answer to the columnâs topic, but at least itâs food for thought. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>What makes a good planner?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;I canât overemphasize the importance of selecting the right person to be a 
maintenance planner. Controlling the entire planning effort relies on staffing, 
period. At stake is a 1.57-fold increase in workforce efficiency. Planners 
function as respected professionals making highly independent judgments one 
after the other based on their skills and experience. These skills include craft 
skills, people skills and data skills. A company can usually find a few of these 
people. However, making them want to be planners can be a challenge.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article doesnât delve into the benefit of planning. Nevertheless, itâs 
worthwhile to mention it. Work coordination from planning increases wrench time 
from the 35 percent of a typical good maintenance force to as much as 55 
percent. Fifty-five percent divided by 35 percent yields a 1.57 improvement. 
This means 30 people with planned and scheduled work could perform the work of 
47 people (30 x 1.57 = 47). Hence, investing in a single planner creates a 
17-person increase to the workforce!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Staffing refers to selecting and training. Itâs the primary controlling 
mechanism for a group of professionals. Without getting too deep into 
organizational theory, other coordinating mechanisms such as continuous 
communication, direct supervision, extensive rules and numerous indicators 
arenât appropriate for the planning function. If a doctor didnât have the proper 
training and skills, all the other coordinating mechanisms would simply confirm 
that the doctor canât perform. Similarly, you canât hire the wrong planners and 
make them into good planners.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Planners should have a combination of key skills and experience. The first of 
these is craft skills. Planners should be journeymen-level craftspeople. Having 
15 to 20 years of experience actually doing work makes them better planners. 
Candidates planning work outside their own areas of expertise could somewhat 
compensate if they excelled with people and data skills.&lt;/P&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
  
&lt;br&gt;


&lt;P&gt;Planners also should have superb people skills and be able to talk with 
anyone. Planners ask operators to clarify needs. They deal with supervisors on a 
peer level. They arrange materials and services through purchasing personnel and 
vendors. They encourage and interpret feedback from technicians. They must also 
write accurate work descriptions in the job plan. A regional manager for a shoe 
distributor told me that his No. 1 problem was salespeople who couldnât write a 
letter that made sense. The same goes for craftspeople. Also, note that planners 
interact with others not under their supervision. A supervisor may have 
responsibility with authority, but a planner has responsibility without 
authority.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Planners must also have excellent data skills. Planners canât fall into the 
trap of planning every job from scratch. They must not only research information 
for new work but also use past feedback and files to make job plans better. In 
addition, they must be able to use a computer to speed the flow of 
information.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On top of these requirements, planners must be self-motivated to stay ahead 
of 30 technicians and be well-respected by the crafts. The nature of job 
planning is that estimates are many times merely an educated guess, and the plan 
itself is only a head start. This is the nature of maintenance work over 
assembly line work. Nevertheless, these estimates and plans are sufficient to 
assign and control work and form the basis to improve plans. Technicians canât 
complain about the âdim-witted planner who came up with this plan.â Technicians 
must realize that the âplanner is a top craftsperson and the plan is a starting 
point. Letâs get on with the work.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, realize that the people who often meet these requirements are the 
hard workers who volunteer for overtime. They arenât afraid to get their hands 
dirty. They would make good supervisors if there were enough openings. Yet, they 
donât want to become planners for two reasons. First, past frustration with 
planning creates a stigma. Second, many plants wrongly transfer technicians to 
planner positions at the same pay rate. Therefore, because itâs difficult to use 
planners to work much overtime, the planners take a net pay cut from the OT 
loss. Thus, only the technicians who avoid OT and want to get off the shop floor 
are interested in the job.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Planning canât work when you select the wrong people. Know how to control 
planning with staffing. Know what makes a good planner. Deal with the issues 
involved and be on your way. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Accurately estimating labor hours</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the principles of effective planning involves how best to estimate the labor hours for a job plan. It turns out that the simple opinion of a skilled technician is preferred over complex methods such as using industrial engineering standards or methods such as averaging past job performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chore of estimating labor hours for a job is a serious planning issue. It can consume so much time that planners can&amp;rsquo;t keep up and leave unplanned work at the time of scheduling. We must have estimates of labor hours to support scheduling and promote productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planners struggle too much over developing an accurate estimate for each job. Many managers expect planners to develop perfect time estimates. They may even grade technicians and planners on actual field performance vs. the estimates. As a result, planners agonize over the estimates to the point where they don&amp;rsquo;t get all the jobs planned; even the ones planned still aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;accurate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The nature of maintenance work in a large industrial complex is that planners can&amp;rsquo;t say with certainty how long a job might take. Maintenance work isn&amp;rsquo;t assembly line work. Job time depends on the actual condition of the equipment and the actual technician assigned. A planner doesn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what needs to be done. The planner doesn&amp;rsquo;t have perfect vision knowing exactly how many bolts need to be burned off. The planner doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the actual condition of the equipment before disassembly. In addition, the person assigned to the job may or may not be a top technician. He or she might be the least-skilled technician on the crew. Experience shows that the best estimates are routinely off as much as 100 percent. A job estimated to take five labor hours might take as many as 10 hours or as few as two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some plants instruct planners to use industrial engineering standards for each tiny portion of a job. For example, planners figure how long each bolt should take to be removed times the number of bolts and then add how fast a typical person walks times the distance the job is from the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They add the job elements together for a total plan estimate. Not only does this type of estimate take forever, it&amp;rsquo;s no more accurate than plus or minus 100 percent. This method is more appropriate for estimating an assembly line task. The execution of an assembly line task thousands of times in a week (or day) justifies the time spent on the estimate. Specific maintenance tasks are usually unique in their actual conditions. Maintenance might service the same type of equipment but in different applications. Also, maintenance may perform the same task only once or twice each year for any specific application, so developing an engineered standard may not be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some planners take strict averages of hours for previous executions of similar work. Some CMMS programs even average past work automatically. The problem with this approach is two-fold. First, execution of the work is, at best, an average. If technicians took too long on past work, their performance carries into the future estimate. The past performance also can include activities such as time associated with interrupting the work. Second, we want a standard, even if not an engineered one. We want to know how long the job should take a qualified tech to perform, but we don&amp;rsquo;t want an estimate to include lesser-skilled technician efforts or unusual past problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that a skilled technician can usually make just as accurate an estimate (plus or minus 100 percent) from a simple review of the job and a quick review of the equipment file (if any history exists). The planner with a skilled technician background should estimate labor hours for a smooth job by a qualified technician. This yields a standard, as accurate as any, for typical maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What good are &amp;ldquo;plus or minus 100 percent&amp;rdquo; estimates? They aren&amp;rsquo;t dependable for individual jobs, but they are extremely useful for a grouping of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Schedulers can group a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of work very accurately. Also, a supervisor can assign a day&amp;rsquo;s worth of work with better control. A single job planned for five hours might run high or low, but a supervisor has more control in assigning a five-hour job, a two-hour job and a one-hour job to an eight-hour technician than if he didn&amp;rsquo;t have any estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The simple estimate of a planner with significant craft experience is preferred over other methods. It yields an estimate useful for scheduling, and the planners can also keep up with the backlog to support scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>File at the component level</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;My previous columns outlined common frustrations with planning and the value of planning. They also provided an overall listing of the main principles that make planning effective. This column continues to dissect the principles of successful planning by exploring how planners should file information. (This is Principle 3 from my â&lt;A href="http://www.noria.com/secure/product_detail.asp?catalogid=103"&gt;Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook&lt;/A&gt;â.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management first rescues planners from working on field crews and then from spending all their time helping jobs-in-progress so they can focus on planning future work. Future work is work not yet started or assigned. At this point, planners encounter a new issue: what level of equipment or system to file information from completed work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Imagine a condensate polisher (Figure 1). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_condensate-polisher.jpg" target=_blank&gt;&lt;IMG height=62 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_condensate-polisher-thumb.jpg" width=100 border=1&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1. Condensate Polisher&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It purifies water by removing anions and cations. This system has hundreds of different pieces of equipment. In this scenario, imagine someone wrote a work order on the Unit 1 condensate polisher anion regeneration valve. One of the first actions of the planner to plan this work order is to check the history file. Unfortunately, with a plant filing work orders by system only (Figure 2 shows a system-level file for the polisher), the planner must sift through hundreds of work orders to find a few on the valve in question. So the planner canât incorporate past learning and feedback into the plan for the current work order. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=91 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_system_level_file.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2. System Level File&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=90 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_component_level-file.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 3. Component Level File&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But for plants that file at the component level (Figure 3), the planner can easily find the two or three work orders written in the past few years on this exact valve. He or she can view past failure modes as well as parts used and time expended to improve the current job plan. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Maintenance typically works on discrete pieces of equipment, not entire systems at once. Even system problems are typically traced to individual pieces of equipment. Thus, maintenance files should be kept at the same level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, those who write work orders should include the component number to assist maintenance. With known component numbers at the start, planners easily can consult the right files or create them if needed. Having tags hung on equipment greatly helps this effort. (Figure 4 illustrates a typical tag hung on a valve. Note that the component tag number exactly matches the component file number.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=138 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_equipment_tag.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Figure 4. Equipment Tag Matches File&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Even a computer system must heed this principle. The computer in its equipment hierarchy may allow people to write a work order for simply N01-CP, thus creating a system-level filing problem for planners. With many plants having thousands of pieces of equipment, consulting a tag number hanging on the equipment is preferred over depending on drilling down computer hierarchies to select correct equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Doc Palmer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility. Publisher McGraw-Hill subsequently sought out Palmer to author the âMaintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbookâ, published in 1999 and now in its eighth printing.

            <title>Inside the Toyota MR-50</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent" is a lofty goal, but who is going to bet against this automaker?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=232 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-georgetown-plant.jpg" width=300&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Georgetown, Ky., plant makes the Camry four-door &lt;BR&gt;sedan, Avalon sedan, and the Solara coupe and convertible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How are your companyâs numbers? For comparison sake, here are some of Toyotaâs: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3 - its rank on the list of the worldâs most respected companies, based on the results from a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers and Financial Times poll. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5 - its rank on the list of the worldâs most admired companies (No. 1 among automobile manufacturers), as selected by 10,000 executives in a survey by Fortune magazine. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;6 - its rank in Harris Interactiveâs study on the worldâs best brands. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;10 - its rank in Harrisâ corporate reputation survey (again, first among car makers). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;10 - its percentage of corporate growth in 2005. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;13 - its percentage share of the global auto market in 2005. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;13.3 - its percentage share of the United States market last year. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;9.06 million - its planned production for 2006, which would surpass General Motors as tops in the industry. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But if you think those numbers are impressive or deserving of attention, consider this one: 50, as in 50 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;

&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The 7 Deadly Wastes&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After years of work to eliminate waste, Toyota identified the following seven types of waste as the most prominent ones: &lt;BR&gt;1) Overproduction &lt;BR&gt;2) Waiting &lt;BR&gt;3) Excess conveyance &lt;BR&gt;4) Over-processing &lt;BR&gt;5) Excess inventory &lt;BR&gt;6) Unnecessary motion &lt;BR&gt;7) Defects and corrections&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent, or MR-50, is the latest in a long line of Toyota initiatives aimed at eliminating waste and inefficiency in its automobile plants. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At most companies, those four words â Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent â would incite panic. However, to understand MR-50, and what it is and isnât, you must know all the details, and you must know Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=187 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-kentucky.jpg" width=291&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky (TMMK) &lt;BR&gt;employs approximately 7,000 workers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Great Expectations &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;High expectations are a key part of the Toyota corporate culture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teruyuki Minoura, the president and CEO of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) from 1998 to 2002, once stated, âItâs a basic characteristic of human beings that they develop wisdom from being put under pressure.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More recently, Atsushi Niimi (TMMNA president/CEO from 2002 to 2005) pressed for high returns when he rolled out Global Body Line, an initiative aimed at increasing production line flexibility. During a keynote address at the 2004 National Manufacturing Week trade show, Niimi proudly reported a 50 percent savings in the cost to put in a new body line and 50 percent space savings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With that as the backdrop, itâs not surprising that maintenance and reliability leaders at Toyotaâs plant in Georgetown, Ky. â the companyâs largest site in North America in terms of size, employment and output â were unfazed when the company requested that its well-established plants pursue a 50 percent maintenance reduction over the next few years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=208 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-maint-leaders.jpg" width=288&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota maintenance leaders Ed Welch (left), David &lt;BR&gt;Absher and Bruce Bremer.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMR-50 is just an acronym,â says Ed Welch, the maintenance manager at the plant, known as Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky (TMMK). âItâs a challenge and a matter of emphasis.â The emphasis is pure Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, it is Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent, not Cost Reduction 50 Percent or Employee Reduction 50 Percent. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âThe goal is to reduce maintenance activities and the maintenance that you perform on a machine by 50 percent. That goal covers every machine and every activity,â says TMMK facilities control manager David Absher. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is not about arbitrarily chopping budgets or personnel. Itâs a game plan that balances todayâs corporate wants and needs with long-term implications and vision. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;

&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Just the Facts&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Site&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. (TMMK), in Georgetown, Ky. Toyota Motor Manufacturing North Americaâs headquarters is located in nearby Erlanger, Ky. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TMMK employment&lt;/STRONG&gt;: approximately 7,000, including 710 in maintenance. &lt;BR&gt;Site size: 7.5 million square feet spread out over 1,300 acres. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Products&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Camry four-door sedan, Avalon sedan, and Solara coupe and convertible; also, four-cylinder and V6 engines, axles, steering components, machined blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies, and dies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Production&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In 2005, the site produced 492,889 vehicles (including 351,883 Camrys) and 498,908 engines. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FYI&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Production began in July 1988; the site made its 6 millionth vehicle in June 2005.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bruce Bremer, the facility engineering manager stationed at Toyotaâs North American manufacturing headquarters in nearby Erlanger, Ky., aligns it with the basic principles of the Toyota Production System. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMR seeks out anything in the organization that is waste or sets you up for waste,â he says. Welch gets specific and straightforward. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhereâs the muda (a Japanese term for waste)? Is it overtime? Reduce it. Is it your indirect material costs? Find out why your costs are higher than the benchmark and find ways to reduce them,â he says. âSpare parts, downtime, planning and scheduling â identify the waste, then go after it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But is a 50 percent reduction in maintenance realistic, let alone possible? Consider your own activities and determine if half of them are unnecessary. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=301 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-identify-waste.jpg" width=204&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota has a long history of initiatives &lt;BR&gt;aimed at identifying waste and &lt;BR&gt;inefficiency. If a process or an activity &lt;BR&gt;(in maintenance, production, etc.) does &lt;BR&gt;not add value, it is targeted for elimination.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âIt may be an impossible dream, but you donât know unless you try,â says Absher. âOur mind-set is to be aggressive. We donât go into anything with the attitude that this is the best we can or could do. If you donât have aggressive goals, how do you determine success? Did you get the maximum out of the initiative? Who knows? We set really high targets and then try like crazy to get there. If we donât reach a target, we try to figure out why we fell short. What stopped us? Is there anything we can do to take it another step?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While itâs apparent what the M in MR-50 stands for, these leaders explain that this is not a âmaintenance initiative.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âEveryone is involved with it,â says Absher. âOur people hate waste â waste of motion, all of the seven deadly muda (see sidebar on page 10). Itâs like we have 7,000 industrial engineers working here. They see waste, and they know how to fix it.â&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.practicingoilanalysis.com/cgi-bin/redirect.exe/0.08011634217857527"&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Shunning the S &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before this article continues, you need to understand that these concepts and the ones that follow are not for the weak-willed. More importantly, you must understand that these concepts are applicable to you and your plant, not just Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI am surprised by folksâ perceptions of us,â says Welch, explaining that outsiders hold the company and its people up as manufacturing Supermen. âWeâre the same humans that are down the street. I donât think weâre that different than most American manufacturing facilities. We have the same bureaucracy, the same frustrations that most companies do.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Absher also shuns an elite label for his plantâs 710-person maintenance crew. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI donât know if I am in a position to offer any advice because, frankly, there are many companies out there that are really, really good at maintenance. They are a lot better than we are,â he says. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=223 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-reduction-percentage.jpg" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent is not a âmaintenanceâ initiative . &lt;BR&gt;It involves all plant employees.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Absher and Bremer cite Eli Lilly, National Starch, Alcoa and Harley-Davidson as maintenance role models for a variety of reasons. For example, they tout Alcoa for its long-range planning capabilities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What makes Toyota different than other companies is culture and how the maintenance department applies an assortment of tools from the Toyota Production System. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Kaizen Culture &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most companiesâ plants, perhaps even yours, thrive and function on the principle of history. âOur original manager in this area put that process in place.â âWe won a best plant award in our state in 1991.â âWeâve always done it that way.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota discourages such rear-view thinking. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Taiichi Ohno, the companyâs former executive vice president and the man credited with developing the Toyota Production System, once said: âSomething is wrong if workers do not look around each day, find things that are tedious or boring, and then rewrite the procedures. Even last monthâs manual should be out of date.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Employees are encouraged, even expected, to shake things up and seek a better way. This system of all-hands continuous improvement is called kaizen. It is applicable for anything from bottlenecks to neck soreness to soaring energy costs and everything in between. Kaizen activities seek to identify and eliminate waste, while also striving to ensure quality and safety. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=228 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-ims.jpg" width=150&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota is a cutting-edge, &lt;BR&gt;high-tech leader. That will &lt;BR&gt;continue with the adoption &lt;BR&gt;of predictive technologies &lt;BR&gt;such as intelligent &lt;BR&gt;maintenance systems (IMS).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âWe donât accept the situation,â says Absher. âWe have the kaizen mind and we work toward continuous improvement. Everyone does. My job is equal to work plus kaizen. Itâs not just the work. Itâs thinking about improving whatâs going on.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are no sacred cows. Employees are encouraged to ânot be afraidâ and to âchallenge the norm.â Problem-solving skills are honed to handle these tasks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Stopping Short &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The kaizen mind-set is most visible in formal kaizen events. These projects bring together a cross-functional team of individuals for a week to three weeks to find solutions to a high-priority problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a tool utilized in many American plants, perhaps even yours. At TMMK in Georgetown, maintenance personnel play key roles on production-led kaizens. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âThat is the perfect situation, a great way to work together, and I encourage that,â says Welch. âMaintenance members have their finger on the pulse of plant manufacturing issues. Their skills are put to good use.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For instance, production workers sought to address an ergonomic issue on the Solara line. During the assembly process for this two-door coupe, operators who work under the car in a pit had to manually open and close each of the heavy doors 150 times a day. The process was physically taxing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance team members designed, fabricated, programmed and implemented a very basic device that used a pneumatic cylinder to close the door when the operator hit the complete button. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The Roots of MR-50&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to TMMK facilities control manager David Absher, MR-50 started as a quality circle project in Japan. This particular quality circle group of Toyota team members reviewed the maintenance procedures on a single piece of equipment, a compressor. The project wound up reducing maintenance on that compressor by 50 percent. The title of the groupâs subsequent presentation was âMR 50 Percent.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota corporate leaders were impressed by the project and felt this thought process could be applied to all plant equipment. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The MR-50 message eventually was delivered to all Toyota plants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For maintenance crews at most U.S. plants, this is where the kaizen process stops. Very few incorporate kaizen and other Toyota Production System (you may call it lean manufacturing) tools internally to address their own wastes and inefficiencies. They also fail to use them to troubleshoot problems or to create strategies for optimal machine reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That P (production) in TPS (or the âmanufacturingâ in lean manufacturing) is often hard to look past. Even Toyotaâs maintenance organization had its difficulties. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLike many organizations, we struggled in trying to take the TPS message from production into maintenance,â says Welch. âWe got stuck, and we still get stuck at times, trying to turn âproduction-based toolsâ into maintenance tools.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But the utilization of TPS components and other optimization strategies is what these leaders feel will make the difference in MR-50 and the drive to reduce maintenance activities by 50 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What follows is an explanation of the traditional and non-traditional tools that the maintenance organization at TMMK and other Toyota plants has at its disposal. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;The MR Toolbox &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintenance-focused kaizen:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Production has problems that can be solved by creative team thinking, but maintenance does, too. The key is to use the available time and energy on kaizen events that address meaningful issues. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âWe use data for all of our analyses,â says Bremer. âWe have key performance indicators that look at downtime, energy usage, reliability, costs and much more. That information will tell you where you need to focus your time.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, Welch and Absher recently assembled groups for events related to spare parts reduction and duplication, servo driver axis wear in robots, planning and scheduling, electrical fault response, and identifying a stronger global CMMS solution. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSpare parts has traditionally been a tough nut to crack,â says Welch. âIf we can commonize equipment designs, we can get to the point where the design that one person builds uses the same cylinder as the design that I build.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Absher lauds the maintenance reduction result from the fault response event in facilities control. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe found that, on average, we experienced a fault on the bus duct in the plant every nine months that typically took 2.7 hours to repair and affected production in the area where the fault occurred,â he says. âWe did a tremendous amount of problem solving, and when we were convinced we had done everything we could to prevent the faults, we determined we would do everything we could to minimize the impact. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=267 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-georgetown-plant2.jpg" width=175&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In 2005, the Georgetown plant &lt;BR&gt;produced 498,908 engines.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âWe developed procedures for an electrical bus duct fault response and practiced them with every team until we got the procedure and the teams to a point where they could correct the fault condition and have a bus back on line in 0.9 hours. This was a 66 percent reduction. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe then developed an electrical system breakdown cart. The cart has everything in it that we determined, through our examination and through dry runs, was necessary to correct and restore the condition. It also has everything necessary to change fuses on the bus and to troubleshoot and operate a distribution system breaker.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;While kaizen events are finite in length, consortiums allow for continual examination of specific issues as well as standards development. Water quality, electrical equipment, welding and energy are some of the active consortiums. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Toyota is exploring the application and feasibility of intelligent maintenance systems. IMS predict and forecast equipment performance so that ânear-zero breakdownâ status is achievable. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data comes from two sources: sensors (mounted on the machine to gather information) and the entire enterprise system (including quality data, past history and trending). By correlating data from these sources (current and historical), itâs possible to predict future performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota has been a financial contributor to the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems program at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Michigan. As a result, TMMK serves as a testbed site for this groundbreaking technology. Activities currently center on air compressor efficiency, robot health and bearing monitoring. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThatâs a nice marriage of academia and manufacturing,â says Welch. âSome of the problems that weâre working on now arenât our top-10 problems because academia does not move at that rate. They are researching much deeper.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He says the alliance is still in its infancy, and that practicality and cost-effectiveness will dictate expansion and overall incorporation of next-generation IMS technology. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âPredictive maintenance will be wonderful, and that is something in the future,â he says. âBut even if we found a predictive tool, could it be cost-effective? Two-thousand robots, seven joints each: Thatâs 14,000 sensors that we would need to put on if weâre going to look at those robot joints. So, how far do you go?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Five-whys:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This simple problem-solving technique helps users get to the root of a problem quickly. The strategy involves looking at any problem and continually asking âWhy?â and âWhat caused this problem?â The answer to the first âwhyâ will often prompt another âwhy.â The answer to the second âwhyâ will prompt another, and so on. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âYouâll find the root cause, and if you can get rid of that, it will never happen again,â Ohno is quoted as saying. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An equally relevant Minoura quote goes, âIf you incorporate all the accumulated knowledge of root causes that youâve got from always asking âWhy? Why? Why?â into your equipment, youâre going to have something that no one else can come close to.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Five-whys, root cause analysis and Reliability-Centered Maintenance are all used by TMMK to determine the appropriate level and method of maintenance for a given plant asset. They also allow the organization to direct limited resources to where they will have the greatest effect. For instance, facilities decided to let roof exhaust fans run to failure rather than regreasing the bearings and replacing the belts. Resources were redirected to chiller maintenance, an endeavor with bigger total cost implications. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Heijunka:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Toyota defines this as the overall leveling, in the production schedule, of the volume and variety of items produced in given time periods. However, heijunka is easily applied to maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Focus on leveling. Maintenance workloads are famous for their peaks and valleys. Through proper planning and scheduling, workloads can be leveled, reducing overtime as well as inactivity. The creation of standardized work and the breakdown of large projects into smaller ones are good ways to reduce time blocks and to level the peaks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âRather than planning a huge PM once every six months, break it into very small increments that you can standardize and do on a daily or weekly basis,â says Absher. âWhen you do that, you can truly achieve heijunka.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bremer applies leveling to maintenance skill standards. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=131 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-workers.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inside the kaizen culture, workers &lt;BR&gt;identify trouble spots, figure out their &lt;BR&gt;root cause and then develop a solution.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=left&gt;âStandards are the base. They explain how something should be done,â he says. âStandards help a new maintenance hire quickly bring his or her skill level up to the level of competence of more experienced technicians. The goal is to achieve a consistently high level of competence for all technicians in your organization.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmarking:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As you may have noticed, humility and continuous improvement are components of the Toyota culture. To that end, maintenance personnel at TMMK and other Toyota plants are constantly on the lookout for best practices. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe arenât anywhere near excellent, but we are on that journey. We learn quite a bit by benchmarking other facilities,â says Welch. âWe are currently benchmarking our (Tier 1 and 2) suppliers whose reliability efforts are, frankly, stronger than ours.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;They benchmark auto plants and non-auto plants. They attend industry events to hear case studies, meet peers and take plant tours. They visit other Toyota sites in the United States and Japan. Some good âfive-whyâ thought occurs from checking out their Toyota brethren. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is that plant different than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy are their reliability numbers higher than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is their safety record better than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Examinations are made to close the gaps. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Genchi genbutsu:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Good things come from walking around someone elseâs plant, but equal good can come from standing still in your own. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The practice of genchi genbutsu holds a colorful place in Toyota lore. Countless stories (real and embellished) tell of a new hire being sent out to the shop floor to âgo and see.â The person stands or sits in one place for an entire eight-hour shift and takes note of anything of importance. More often than not, the person pinpoints waste and issues related to safety, flow, quality, etc. But he or she may also identify maintenance issues. Perhaps a machine is making uncharacteristic, intermittent noises. Perhaps lubrication procedures are not being properly followed. Perhaps a technician needed to make numerous trips to the tool crib to complete a particular work order. Maybe an operator made improper adjustments to the machine. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In October 1935, five years after the death of Toyota Group founder Sakichi Toyoda, family members gathered his teachings and published them as the Toyoda Precepts. The precepts act as the core of Toyota management and guide the companyâs actions. They include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Be contributive to the development and welfare of the country by working together regardless of position, in faithfully fulfilling your duties. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be at the vanguard of the times through endless creativity, inquisitiveness and pursuit of improvement. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be practical and avoid frivolity. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be kind and generous; strive to create a warm, homelike atmosphere. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be reverent and show gratitude for things great and small in thought and deed. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An eight-hour standathon is not required in this practice. The bottom line is: To know the problem, you need to see the problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Total Productive Maintenance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The benefits of TPM are well-documented. The more maintenance activities that can be shifted to the operator, the more time technicians have for productive, proactive work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At TMMK, operators are involved with tasks ranging from lubrication, filtration, calibration and minor repairs. In the weld shop, they perform the tip changes on welding robots. Overall, assignments vary based on operation complexity and safety. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOver the years, Iâve seen fewer tasks termed as âskilled work,ââ says Absher. âSkilled work has taken on an entirely different meaning because of the rapid advancement of technology.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visual controls:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This tool is closely tied to TPM. Basically, it is a method of visually conveying information. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Gauge taping is a simple example. Color-coded tape is applied to a gauge in pie-shaped sections to pinpoint levels that are proper (green zone), elevated (yellow) and high (red). A newly hired operator may know nothing about his machine, but he can draw a conclusion from that visual. âItâs in the red. I better tell someone.â Quicker identification of potential issues leads to fewer breakdowns and shorter outages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe person calls you and says âthis and this is out of standard.â In the 90 seconds it takes to get there, you should already be troubleshooting in your head,â says Absher. âThat saves time.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quality circles:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A small group of team members meet on a regular basis to identify and solve problems. These people raise the level of quality, efficiency and other aspects of work performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe experts â production, maintenance and facilities personnel â determine how to make improvements to processes and remove waste from the system,â says Bremer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;The Numbers Add Up &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The items mentioned are just nine of the tools that Toyota maintenance departments have at their disposal to reduce maintenance and increase overall plant reliability. There is just as much maintenance applicability in other TPS tools, including 5-S, hoshin, jidoka, jishuken, kanban, nemawashi, poka-yoke and yokaten. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The bottom line is that TMMK is not trying to reduce maintenance 50 percent through a two-week kaizen event or any other single tool. Thatâs not the Toyota way. By taking a plethora of tools traditionally thought of as benefiting production and translating and applying them into the maintenance world, the chances of realizing goals â even âimpossible dreamâ goals â increase. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=162 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-production.jpg" width=250&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;By utilizing Toyota Production System tools &lt;BR&gt;like heijunka, five-whys, visual controls and &lt;BR&gt;genchi genbutsu, the TMMK maintenance &lt;BR&gt;organization is becoming a fine-tuned machine.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Kaizen events might reduce maintenance 12 percent. TPM might supply 8 percent. Intelligent maintenance systems might return 5 percent. 5-S . . . perhaps 4 percent. And so on and so on. Pretty soon, MR-50 doesnât seem that impossible. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You donât have to be Superman, or even Toyota for that matter, to make groundbreaking, meaningful change. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A Toyota saying goes that âthere can be no successful monozukuri (making things) without hito-zukuri (making people).â Developing all those involved with maintenance and reliability into kaizen-minded problem-solvers, and then giving those people the time, tools and support needed to pursue best practices, can radically change the numbers for your department, your plant and your company. Enhanced reputation, production, market share, etc., are within your reach. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you donât think you can apply this, start asking âWhy?â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/RFdJXE4Zug4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Maintenance management legends</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;There are many paradigms and legends surrounding maintenance management in plants. Often, the legends are known to be untrue, but people live with them because it is politically correct, or simply convenient. To be successful in improving equipment reliability and maintenance management, plants must break the legends that exist in their organizations. Some of the legends will be addressed in this article. You may find that these legends are uncomfortably close to describing how your plant operates. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 1: Maintenance cost must be reduced quickly &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Plants should reduce maintenance cost. But there are many variables that can be affected by lowering the maintenance budget. It is, therefore, important to consider how the cost cut is implemented. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of us can cut maintenance costs in any plant in the world very quickly by 40 percent. We simply get rid of some people and stop doing certain maintenance jobs. If you get the opportunity to take a job like this, don't plan on staying more than a year. The consequences of short-term maintenance management will most likely be devastating to the total cost, and problems will start to show after a year or two due to ill-maintained assets. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mandating a plant to lower maintenance costs quickly can be compared to asking a hockey team to increase the average number of goals per game from two goals to four without any coaching or guidance. The team can most likely produce four goals per game, if no other variables are considered. Obviously, we want the hockey team to win, not just score four goals per game. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is a balance between goals scored and goals given up. It is a mystery why many plants don't pick up on this simple concept of balance. It is not uncommon to see an organization completely focused on cost without considering the total picture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If we lower the maintenance budget and don't change other aspects of the business practice, the results will most likely be very poor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Changes in maintenance cost are interrelated to product quality and production output. A reduction in maintenance cost will not lead to improved quality and production output. But an improvement in equipment reliability will most likely improve production output and quality. Improved quality and production output will reduce maintenance cost. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance cost cannot be reduced quickly because it takes time to improve equipment reliability. Improved reliability will reduce cost, but reduced cost will not improve reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 2: People don't like change &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I often hear that people don't like change. In my experience, people love change â they just don't want to be changed by someone else. People are often very receptive to change as long as they are part of the change process. The problem is when a project improvement plan goes through the usual number-crunching, while the involvement of people is often forgotten. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, people in the plant typically can identify planning and scheduling improvement opportunities, yet most of us are reactive by nature; we don't want to work to strict guidelines, such as planning and schedule exactly what to do three days from now. Improving planning and scheduling requires a culture change together with detailed, agreed-upon processes and procedures. Even though we know this, plants sometimes try to improve planning and scheduling by talking over a cup of coffee or, at best, sending a couple of planners on a two-day planning and scheduling course. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Production and operations changes are often 80 to 90 percent dependent on technical solutions including process automation. An equipment reliability and maintenance change initiative is 95 percent dependent on changing peoples' behavior. Management must address the issues of involvement and acceptance while encouraging the few enthusiastic souls in a project. Project success can be expressed as R = Q x A x E (Results = quality of actions x acceptance for change x enthusiasm for change). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 3: People are our biggest asset &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If you work in plant management or as a corporate officer, it is politically correct to say "people are our biggest asset." Most managers would agree to that statement. I don't agree. People are not a company's biggest asset â the right people are a company's biggest asset, and the wrong people are liabilities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I confirmed this opinion during a recent seminar for a group of supervisors and craftspeople. One of the discussions started with the question, "Isn't it true that if any given crew in this plant would lose its poorest performing people (about 10 to 20 percent of the total), the loss would hardly be noticed?" After the laughs and pointing had subsided, several people confirmed that there were always a number of people in any given crew who had "never accomplished an honest day's work." These people destroy morale and, in some cases, even slow the rest of the crew down. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management must deal with underperforming people. If you have a decent relationship with your union or your non-union workforce, they are usually receptive to discussing these matters. Poor performers are a big problem for them as well. It is also true that people cannot be more effective than the system in which they work allows them to be. Management can minimize the amount of wasted time and energy by implementing good maintenance and reliability processes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 4: Having more maintenance people on shift reduces downtime &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If you have many problems in your plant, operations typically requests more people on shift to fix the breakdowns. If this is the situation in your plant, you are going down the wrong path. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you have a multitude of problems in your plant, you need to find out why and fix the source of the problems. What is the solution for your plant? Most likely, you don't have enough time to repair all equipment problems found in your area, and you don't always find the problems before a breakdown. So, we need more people, right? In the short run, possibly, but not necessarily. Definitely not in the long run. Here is a checklist of possible problems: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do operators perform detailed equipment inspections? If not, make sure operators know how to inspect a bearing, motor, coupling, hydraulic motor, fluid coupling, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do your maintenance people have detailed inspection lists, take readings and analyze trends in order to identify symptoms on equipment? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do you use your craftspeople by having well-planned jobs for them? Do you schedule maintenance jobs in coordination with operations? By executing high-quality inspections, we can make sure that we know about most symptoms. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 5: We can't motivate maintenance craftspeople to improve reliability because they make more money when things break down &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Maintenance people typically do make more money when things break down. A perceived Catch-22 by maintenance management is that crews can't be motivated to improve reliability and maintenance because higher equipment reliability will reduce the amount of overtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, the answer to the question goes back to Legend 3. Only a minor percentage of people don't contribute as well as others; the rest of us want to be good performers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key word is pride. Pride matters more than overtime pay. Pride drives a relatively low-paid U.S. Marine to risk his or her life for months at a time. Pride drives a maintenance craftsperson to spend an extra hour or two to align a pump to one-thousandth of an inch even though few will notice. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management can instill pride in an organization by developing clear expectations for reliability and maintenance, and by training and supporting people long term in achieving these expectations. For example, develop a clear definition of preventive maintenance and develop an action plan and training initiatives on how to improve inspection routes, lubrication, cleaning practices, operating procedures, alignment and other preventive maintenance practices. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since money also is a motivator, provide incentive pay for equipment reliability. One of the fastest preventive maintenance program setups we have seen was at a car manufacturing plant in Europe that offered its crews (operations and maintenance) a bonus on each percentage over 97 percent line efficiency. The results appeared on reports just weeks after the announcement â the actual equipment reliability improvement probably started hours after the announcement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 6: New computer software will improve reliability and maintenance performance &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It is not unusual to see a maintenance organization implement a new CMMS with the hopes that this new computer software will improve plant reliability. In truth, new software can be a great help, but it is only a tool. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If plant performance improves following a software change, it is not the software itself that contributes the majority of improvements. Improvements will be a synthesis of the implementation and execution of better work processes, behavior changes and higher-quality data from the software. The obvious question then becomes, "Can't the plant improve work processes, behaviors and data quality with the old CMMS?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sometimes maintenance software updates become so cumbersome that a plant disregards obvious fundamentals due to work overload. For example, the bill of material for equipment isn't always up to date in the old system, and it will not be up to date in the new system unless an effort is made to improve the data. It is a common argument that it costs too much to update the bill of materials, yet we accept the cost of having each craftsperson use a significant amount of time every day looking for parts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In some plants, training is reduced to a minimum and often performed several months before the system is put in use. The result is that, at best, about 30 percent of the CMMS functionality is used and that only 30 percent of the people know how to use it effectively. This results in a 9 percent usage of the system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If your organization is ready to implement a new CMMS, make sure you update the bill of materials, standard job plans, equipment numbering and asset numbering in the old system. Also, ask yourself if you plan and schedule jobs well today. If not, the problem is usually not the software. People will blame the software because it can't talk back, but the real problems are lack of discipline in backlog management, prioritization issues, and the inability of operations and maintenance to coordinate production and maintenance schedules. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 7: Equipment criticality decides inspection frequency &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It is common to see plants base component inspection frequency on a criticality analysis study. At first, it may seem sensible to base inspection frequency on criticality of equipment, but let's illustrate the misconception with an example. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let's assume we are setting the inspection frequency for a very simple component such as a bolt. Let's assume the bolts in question are holding a mechanical seal on a pump. The pump and seal are very critical according to the criticality study. The inspection frequency for the highest criticality score is often recommended to one inspection every shift. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Intuitively, you notice that it doesn't make any sense to inspect a bolt every shift. Why? Because the inspection frequency must be based on how long, on average, it takes to develop a failure in a component. The bolt in our example will not fail from one shift to another unless there is a completely random event. The most likely failure is that the bolt comes loose over a two- to six-month period. We should therefore set the inspection frequency according to the Failure Developing Period (FDP), by estimating the FDP, and set the inspection frequency to FDP over two. In our example, we estimate an FDP of four months and set the inspection frequency to two months. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Planning: What's in it for you?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;What is the value of planning and scheduling maintenance work? It depends on 
who is asking the question. Are you a technician, a crew supervisor, a plant 
manager or a company? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Technician&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Enlightened maintenance 
technicians welcome planning for a few reasons. First, technicians gain their 
own file clerks. No longer do they have to keep tidbits of technical information 
in their lockers or memories. They simply write down information on job plans as 
feedback and the planners include it on future plans for the same equipment. The 
planners keep a file for every piece of equipment. In a plant with thousands of 
devices, technicians need the services of a competent file clerk. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Advances in plant maintenance often result from little lessons of the past. 
The lesser technicians simply canât keep up with the minute details. The better 
technicians have a wealth of this information stored in their minds. The planner 
as file clerk can put the lessons learned into plant memory. &lt;/P&gt;

  


&lt;P&gt;Second, planners not only save these past lessons for future job plans, they 
codify the lessons into formal procedures. They take the lessons from feedback 
and gradually improve written job plans for specific equipment in specific plant 
environments. Technicians would be crazy not to want planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Crew Supervisor &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Enlightened supervisors 
welcome planning because it gives them more control over maintenance work. This 
is a huge statement because the chief impediment to planning is supervisors that 
fear a loss of control. These supervisors reason that their specific role in 
maintenance is to decide what maintenance to do and which jobs to work on. Yet, 
maintenance supervisors should never assume this role. The priority system of 
the plant should dictate work. Maintenance should do the higher priority jobs 
first. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enlightened supervisors realize their role is to be out in the field 
supervising. One reason supervisors donât supervise present maintenance work is 
they are too busy lining up future jobs. They look over the work and decide how 
they would assign it. Planners free them of this task by taking care of the 
future work. They include craft needs and labor hours on job plans in addition 
to general job scopes. This allows supervisors to assign work without inspecting 
every job personally. Not only does this give supervisors information to control 
their work better, it gives them extra time to spend with their crews on 
maintenance work already in progress. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A planning group further frees supervisors from constantly reviewing entire 
backlogs of open work to decide on the next job assignments. A planning group 
provides a backlog service when it develops a weekly schedule. Instead of a crew 
supervisor having to scan an entire backlog of open work orders, the group gives 
supervisors a subset of the backlog matching their available crew labor hours 
for a week. A supervisor needs only to scan this subset instead of the whole 
backlog when selecting next work assignments. Supervisors would be crazy not to 
want planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Plant Manager &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Enlightened managers welcome 
planning because it allows them to control maintenance productivity. How much 
maintenance should be done? Is it enough to handle all the emergencies? What 
other work should be done? With the planning group developing a weekly schedule 
as a work goal, management can see if the maintenance force accomplishes the 
expected amount of work. If not, the manager has a basis for asking, âWhy not?â 
Did the storeroom run out of parts? Did emergencies interrupt the schedule? 
Simply starting crews with a goal of work each week lifts wrench time from the 
traditional 35 percent to upward of 55 percent. Thatâs a 57 percent rise. 
Multiplying a 50-person group by 1.57 yields a 78-person workforce, a 28-person 
improvement. Managers would be crazy not to want planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Company&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Enlightened companies and their 
shareholders welcome planning because the additional productivity means more 
completed maintenance work. More completed work means higher plant availability 
for producing product and higher profits. Companies would be crazy not to want 
planning. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TD&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a 
practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 
1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance 
planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning 
to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility. Publisher 
McGraw-Hill subsequently sought out Palmer to author the "Maintenance Planning 
and Scheduling Handbook", first published in 1999 and now in its second edition 
in 2006. Contact him at &lt;A

            <title>Morning meetings: Maintenance planning and scheduling</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;All over the world, most plants have morning meetings. As a consultant, I have been asked to sit in on many of these meetings, and my conclusion from these experiences is that most of them are not very effective or meaningful to the attendees. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;First of all, the focus of the meetings is often on past events. For example, each department reports what happened yesterday, and very little time is spent on today's plans. In addition, even less time is spent on activities that must take place tomorrow and beyond.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;The worst-case scenario&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Let me tell you a little about the least effective meetings I have attended by describing a generic case. At this meeting, the room is noisy, people have to stand up because there is no place to sit, and there are no visual aids such as an overhead projector, flip charts or a white board. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In addition, the leader of the meeting does not lead the meeting at all and often speaks with a low voice, making it impossible to hear. Attendees receive the latest production report and are asked â one by one â to read the part for which they are responsible. At this point, it is common to see that people do not listen to parts of the production report that do not directly apply to them. In addition, when they read their own parts, others do not listen to them either. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the very worst scenarios, maintenance craftspeople do not start working in the morning until they have talked with their supervisor. This often causes a delay in work because the supervisor attends the morning meeting at 8 a.m., while the crew arrives at 7 a.m. The crew has learned, from long experience, that job schedules and work assignments are frequently changed as a result of the morning meeting. Therefore, they wait until the supervisor comes back from the morning meeting around 8:30 a.m. to begin work for the day. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;Creating more effective meetings&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;To improve the effectiveness of your plantâs morning meetings, I propose that you ask yourselves some of the following basic questions: &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Why do I attend the meeting? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Do I attend because our plant has always had those meetings every day at 8 a.m.? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Do I attend because this is the most efficient way for the organization to receive information about what happened last night? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;What do other attendees expect from me, and what do I expect from them? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Is there a way I can improve communication at these meetings? For example, could I prepare my part of the presentation with charts and other visual aids and hope that others follow the example? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Do we need to have these meetings every day, or would it be enough to have them on Mondays and Fridays? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Do we need to have these meetings in the morning, or could we move it to mid-day and then focus on tomorrow's activities? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;Effective meeting characteristics&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Some very effective meetings I have attended share some of the following characteristics: &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The leader leads the meeting, and he or she can be distinctly heard throughout the entire room. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The meeting starts on time and ends on time. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Visual aids are used, and only information meaningful to the majority of the attendees is presented. Especially effective meetings present all their information using Power Point or other presentation software projected on a large screen. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The meeting focuses on communicating important information, describing recent results and defining problems that must be solved. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Each meeting includes a three- to five-minute teaching/discussion break. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;No meetings?&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Personally, I believe it is good to have meetings if they are productive, and it is a given that attendees must include operations and maintenance people at a minimum. If the purpose of your meetings is to spread information, you can sometimes accomplish this using internal televisions and computer networks. With those capabilities, you can possibly have fewer meetings.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Follow these planning, scheduling principles</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the first two issues of &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;, I outlined why planning frustrates many companies and why many planners do not plan. I explained that serious frustration stems from incorrectly encouraging supervisors to wait on planning for all reactive work. I also wrote that planners commonly help jobs in progress to the extent that they have no time left to plan new work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With these major issues addressed, this column enumerates all of the principles of a successful planning and scheduling program. The six planning principles and six scheduling principles listed on this page form the essence of my âMaintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbookâ. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; requires keeping planners independent from the supervision of the individual crews. Supervisors commonly grab planners to help on jobs, making them unavailable for planning. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; is to have the planners (now available for planning) concentrate on planning future work rather than merely helping deal with delays of jobs already in progress. This principle takes advantage of the repetitious nature of most maintenance work and moves jobs up a learning curve. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 3&lt;/STRONG&gt; recognizes that planners can only practically retrieve prior job feedback to improve jobs if the file or computer system tracks jobs at the component level (e.g., a valve instead of a system). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 4&lt;/STRONG&gt; utilizes the expertise of an experienced technician as a planner (with perhaps limited history review) to estimate job labor hours. This avoids time-consuming techniques of building estimates. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 5&lt;/STRONG&gt; has this planner utilize the skills of the field technicians and avoid extra time giving more procedural information than necessary on initial job plans. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planning Principle 6&lt;/STRONG&gt; reminds us that the purpose of planning is to reduce delays and help technicians spend more time on jobs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Planning also involves scheduling because reducing delays during individual jobs allows supervisors to assign more jobs. Scheduling answers the question of how many jobs to assign. While the planning principles address major issues, the scheduling principles are more of a framework. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; obligates each job plan to estimate labor hours and craft skill levels. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; encourages not interrupting jobs already in progress through proper prioritization of work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 3&lt;/STRONG&gt; commits crew leaders to forecast labor hours for craft skills available for the next week. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 4&lt;/STRONG&gt; combines all of the forecast crew labor hours with the estimated labor hours of the planned jobs, generally in order of job priority. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 5&lt;/STRONG&gt; has crew leaders schedule and assign daily work (even though the planning department allocates the weekâs goal of work). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduling Principle 6&lt;/STRONG&gt; establishes the importance of measuring schedule success. Measuring this outcome helps management insure that planning and scheduling does take place. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Finally, maintenance must acknowledge reactive work. Management must assure crew leaders that for urgent work, it is OK to work an unplanned job and it is OK to break a schedule. Planning must not constrain crews from immediately beginning work on urgent jobs. Nevertheless, planning can abbreviate its efforts on urgent work and many times produce a helpful job plan before maintenance begins work. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Allowing crews to work unplanned work and break schedules is vital to consider, especially for reactive plants. If it is OK to work on unplanned jobs and break schedules, where is the productivity gain? Actual experience shows that simply starting each crew every week with a sufficient allocation of work as a goal significantly boosts crew productivity, usually in excess of 50 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This column and my previous two are most appropriate for readers that already recognize the value of a planning program. My column in the January/February issue will address and quantify the value of maintenance planning. Future articles after that will review the principles in greater depth and will also handle individual issues that commonly arise in planning efforts.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TD&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility. Publisher McGraw-Hill subsequently sought out Palmer to author the "Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook", first published in 1999 and now in its second edition in 2006. Contact him at &lt;A href="mailto:palmerplanning@bellsouth.net"&gt;palmerplanning@bellsouth.net&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/planning_and_scheduling/~4/bScUBq9rvoQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Constructing an Effective Maintenance Plan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/5ea7b841-e5c7-473a-b804-e7f78e9cc4d4_effective-maintenance-plan.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Creating a maintenance plan is generally not difficult to do. But creating a comprehensive maintenance program that is &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; poses some interesting challenges. It would be difficult to appreciate the subtleties of what makes a maintenance plan effective without understanding how the plan forms part of the total maintenance environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article explains what makes the difference between an ordinary maintenance plan and a good, effective maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Defining the terms&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance practitioners across industry use many maintenance terms to mean different things. So to level the playing field, it is necessary to explain the way in which a few of these terms have been utilized throughout this document to ensure common understanding by all who read it. It must be emphasized, however, that this is the author&amp;rsquo;s preferred interpretation of these terms, and should not necessarily be taken as gospel truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In sporting parlance, the maintenance policy defines the &amp;ldquo;rules of the game&amp;rdquo;, whereas the maintenance strategy defines the &amp;ldquo;game plan&amp;rdquo; for that game or season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance policy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Highest-level document, typically applies to the entire site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance strategy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Next level down, typically reviewed and updated every 1 to 2 years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance program&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Applies to an equipment system or work center, describes the total package of all maintenance requirements to care for that system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance checklist&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; List of maintenance tasks (preventive or predictive) typically derived through some form of analysis, generated automatically as work orders at a predetermined frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Short-term &lt;strong&gt;maintenance plan&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimes called a &amp;ldquo;schedule of work&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; Selection of checklists and other ad-hoc work orders grouped together to be issued to a workshop team for completion during a defined maintenance period, typically spanning one week or one shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;The Maintenance Information Loop&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 below describes the flow of maintenance information and how the various aspects fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

	Figure 1 &amp;ndash; Maintenance Information Loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The large square block indicates the steps that take place within the computerized maintenance management system, or CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is good practice to conduct some form of analysis to identify the appropriate maintenance tasks to care for your equipment. RCM2 is probably the most celebrated methodology, but there are many variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The analysis will result in a list of tasks that need to be sorted and grouped into sensible chunks, which each form the content of a checklist. Sometimes it may be necessary to do some smoothing and streamlining of these groups of tasks in an iterative manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most obvious next step is to schedule the work orders generated by the system into a plan of work for the workshop teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less common, however, is to use this checklist data to create a long-range plan of forecasted maintenance work. This plan serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results can be used to determine future labour requirements, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They feed into the production plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The schedule of planned jobs is issued to the workshop and the work is completed. Feedback from these work orders, together with details of any equipment failures, is captured in the CMMS for historical reporting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A logical response to this shop floor feedback is that the content of the checklists should be refined to improve the quality of the preventive maintenance, especially to prevent the recurrence of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common mistake however, is to jump straight from the work order feedback and immediately change the words on the checklists. When this happens, the integrity of the preventive maintenance programme is immediately compromised because the revised words on the checklist have no defendable scientific basis. This should be avoided wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The far better approach to avoid this guessing game is to route all the checklist amendments through the same analysis as was used originally to create the initial checklists. This means that the integrity of the maintenance program is sustained over the long term. Implicit in this approach, however, is the need to have a robust system in which the content of the analysis can be captured and updated easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, all the information that gets captured into the CMMS must be put to good use otherwise it is a waste of time. This is the value of management reports that can be created from maintenance information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;In the RCM analysis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without describing the complete RCM analytical process, it is instructive at this stage to point out a few details that are important to the content of such an analysis because of the way they can impact the overall maintenance plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Table 1 &amp;ndash; Information captured in the RCM-style analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="177"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="180"&gt;

			&lt;/td&gt;

			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="177"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
					Preventive/ corrective maintenance tasks (as appropriate)&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="200"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="177"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="180"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Task frequency&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;

			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="200"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Task duration&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Running/stopped marker&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The center column is what will be found in any typical RCM-style analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to that, there is value in constructing a hierarchy of the equipment system showing assemblies, subassemblies and individual components. This helps to keep track of which section of the system is being considered at any time, and the list of components also helps to identify the spare parts requirements for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of vital importance is the clear identification of the root cause of each failure, as this will affect the selection of a suitable maintenance task. To illustrate this point, consider for example, a seized gearbox. &amp;ldquo;Seized&amp;rdquo; is an effect. There could be several root causes of this failure mode that can be addressed in different ways through the maintenance program. There is usually no value in aiming maintenance at the effect of a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also important from a planning perspective is to identify the time it will take to carry out each task independently. The sum total of these task times gives a good indication of how long the total work order will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the above depends on the production process and the site&amp;rsquo;s operating context, so these comments should be taken simply as a guideline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following are a few points to consider when constructing a preventive maintenance program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance tasks must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		aim at the failure process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		be specific&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		include specifications or tolerances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wherever possible, aim for predictive rather than preventive tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		measure or check for conditions against a standard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		report the results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		create a follow-on task to repair or replace at the next opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Check and replace, if necessary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; tasks destroy planned times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequencies and estimated times for each task must be accurate and meaningful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Try wherever possible to only plan shutdown time for &amp;ldquo;non-running&amp;rdquo; tasks. Keep &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; tasks to be done during periods of normal production. Structure the maintenance program to allow for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Sorting and grouping of checklists&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After analysing all the maintenance requirements for the equipment system, these individual tasks would be grouped together to create the checklists, based on common criteria for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Craft&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Frequency&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safety / Non-safety tasks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Running / Non-running checks and sensible&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timing, etc. &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Smoothing the PM workload&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to smooth the PM workload, a robust approach is to base the spread of PM activities on the checklists arising from the RCM-style analysis. This assumes that the analysis has been conducted thoroughly and that it is in a format that can be amended easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The graph in Figure 2 below illustrates how it is possible to arrange the occurrence of the PM work orders in such a way to create the smoothest possible flow of regular preventive maintenance work, while still leaving enough time to carry out those &amp;ldquo;follow-on&amp;rdquo; corrective maintenance tasks that were identified from conducting the preventive/predictive checks during the last maintenance stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to notice that just because two checklists may have the same frequency, it is not necessary to schedule them to be done at the same time. Sometimes, of course, it does make practical sense to schedule PMs for the same day, but don&amp;rsquo;t assume that this is always true. As a general rule, in an automated or continuous process production environment, the total amount of work on one checklist or work planned for one maintenance period should not exceed 80 percent of the total time available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-2.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 2 &amp;ndash; Smoothing the PM workload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to achieve this smoothed workload pattern, it may be necessary to return to the timings, frequencies, groupings, start dates, etc., that were specified in the original analysis and rework some of the data. This is the iterative approach that was mentioned earlier in the description of Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Short-term scheduling of planned maintenance work&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is well-recognized in modern maintenance circles that there is great value in planning the maintenance workload at a macro level over a long-term horizon as well as at a detailed level over a short horizon. These two activities serve significantly different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regular work orders are created automatically in Maximo every night from the work order templates in the PM Master table. These fresh work orders are generated typically 30 days prior to the Target Start date specified on the PM. Other work orders are also created manually by the system users, such as craftsmen and engineers. All these work orders need to be prioritized according to the importance and urgency of the tasks, and they need to be planned into the weekly workload of the maintenance crews to ensure that a well-balanced selection of work is assigned to each crew without them becoming overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example layout of the weekly maintenance work schedule is shown in Figure 3 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-3.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3 &amp;ndash; Example of weekly maintenance work schedule &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most often, a CMMS will only produce report data in text or numerical format. Because engineers like to see things in a graphical or pictorial representation, however, it may be necessary to combine the use of the CMMS with another package that has graphics capability, such as a spreadsheet. The following descriptions rely on the ability of the CMMS to produce a &amp;ldquo;flat file&amp;rdquo; from a report, which can then be imported into a spreadsheet and manipulated further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If possible, it would be preferable to retain all the raw data within the CMMS and simply produce all the graphs and reports from that environment. There are two obstacles to this approach, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Very few CMMS packages have graphical capability;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Very few CMMS packages will capture or provide the full spectrum of data that may be required to construct the desired selection of graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The alternative solution, therefore, is to copy the required selection of data from the CMMS to the spreadsheet environment where it can be manipulated further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Long-range maintenance planning&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some sites enjoy the luxury of having regular, fixed maintenance windows built into the production plans. For example, it could be agreed that every Tuesday morning Production Unit 1 will stop production and the equipment will be made available to the maintenance crew for six hours. During this six-hour window, the maintenance crew has the opportunity to assign as many people as required to complete all the planned maintenance activities in that work center. Thereafter, the system is handed back to the production team until the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases however, there is no such regular routine in place. Opportunities for the maintenance teams to conduct planned maintenance need to be negotiated and agreed with the production teams on an &amp;ldquo;as-needed&amp;rdquo; basis. Unfortunately, this is very often reduced to the maintenance department begging for access to the equipment. Furthermore, this plea is often met with the unsympathetic response from the production teams that they have to run the equipment in order to meet their targets and they therefore cannot afford to release it for maintenance. This is a very short-sighted view in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The generation of a long-range maintenance plan that shows the number of hours of preventive maintenance work to be done in each work center over an 18- to 24-month horizon is a valuable tool. It gives the production schedulers visibility of the amount of time that is required for this preventive maintenance so that they can proactively plan to release the equipment for those periods. This makes the job of planning the maintenance activities so much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The nature of the production environment at the author&amp;rsquo;s site makes it difficult to implement a regular, fixed pattern of maintenance windows as described above. For this reason a long-range maintenance plan is produced to give the production teams as much advance warning as possible of the anticipated maintenance requirements. This plan shows the forecasted maintenance hours for each operating unit, by craft type, in weekly chunks over a 24-month horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Table 2 below illustrates what the structure of a long-range maintenance plan might look like. A flat file is created from the master data table in Maximo which contains details of all the maintenance tasks and checklists with their corresponding equipment details, duration, frequencies, crafts, next due dates, etc. This information is imported into a spreadsheet, which uses a series of filters and formulae to produce the long-range plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-tab2.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Table 2 &amp;ndash; Example layout of long-range maintenance plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on this report, the production planners make the necessary allowances in the production calendars so that the equipment will be made available for maintenance. This allowance is initially made at a macro level. The exact dates and times for maintenance will be agreed in the week or two before it is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This arrangement of the numbers can also be used to help smooth the workload across the weeks by adjusting the due dates of the maintenance tasks in the CMMS as described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Long-range labor plan&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The above explanations describe how to identify the anticipated number of maintenance hours in a production area. This next section covers the approach to verifying that there is sufficient manpower available to carry out all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to ensure that each team on site has adequate craftsman resources available to cover all the work that will arise in their areas, a long-range workload vs. manpower forecast can be produced. This amounts to a graph that compares the hours of work to be done each month with the corresponding man-hours of labor available. A graph is constructed for each craft group within each workshop team, spanning the next 18- to 24-month horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the long-term prediction shows that the level of maintenance activity is about to increase beyond the level that can be accomplished with the existing resources, this advance warning will ensure that there will be sufficient time to recruit and train additional resources before the situation goes out of control. Similarly, a decrease in the predicted level of maintenance activity will give sufficient advance visibility of the opportunity to reassign craftsman resources to other teams or activities. This proactive approach will lead to improved manpower utilization and less panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Listed below are some of the categories of data that are used to construct the graphs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Workload (i.e. everything that will occupy the craftspeople&amp;rsquo;s time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		preventive maintenance hours from the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		breakdown allowance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		corrective / follow-on work / results-based tasks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		project work (ad-hoc hours for each forthcoming project activity independently)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		allowances for meetings / training, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower (i.e. net man-hours available)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		gross man-hours available in the crew&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		allowances for leave and sickness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		additional allowance for overtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sum of the workload hours for each month draws the workload line. The sum of the manpower hours draws the labor capacity line. Where the workload exceeds the labor capacity, the load must be smoothed, or additional resources may be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The preventive maintenance hours from the CMMS are obtained from the totals from the long-range maintenance plan described in the previous section. The allowances for breakdowns, corrective work, etc., are calculated as a rolling 12-month average of the demonstrated actual data from the CMMS. Data for other allowances may be sourced from elsewhere if not contained in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower is basically the effective number of man-hours available for each craft in the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some example graphs are shown in Figure 4 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-4.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4 &amp;ndash; Example workload vs. labor-capacity graphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where the manpower exceeds the workload, everything is in control. Where the workload exceeds the manpower, it will be necessary to reduce some of the non-essential activities at that time, or increase the people availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;Feedback and reporting&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Feedback information returning from the shop floor, either by way of the planned work order responses, or from equipment failures will be captured in the CMMS. This information can be summarized on a report such as shown in Figure 5 below. The key recipients of these reports are the reliability engineers who look after each equipment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ideally, the engineer should look at every work order that was raised in his area, but this is not always feasible, so a summary report such as this is useful. The reliability engineer must then decide on the appropriate course of action in response to each failure or observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-5.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5 &amp;ndash; Example weekly failures report &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The algorithm shown in Figure 6 below describes the thought process that should be going through the minds of the reliability engineers every time they review the failure work orders as shown on the summary report in Figure 5 above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It must be remembered, however, that every time the &amp;ldquo;Amend Checklists&amp;rdquo; option is selected, this amendment should be routed through the original RCM analysis to ensure the integrity of the maintenance program is not violated. Amending the checklists without running through the method and structure of the original analysis is a mistake. Regardless of the approach that has been used to record the original analysis, it is worth it in the long run to force the reliability engineers to route every amendment through the analysis and record the results for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a spreadsheet has been identified as the most appropriate option, then it should be structured in a robust and user-friendly fashion. If it is clumsy to update, it will fall into disrepair, and the integrity of the program is lost. A database system is a far better option for this purpose, if a suitable one is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_porrill-constructing-6.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6 &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;What broke&amp;rdquo; algorithm &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;font class="subtitle2"&gt;The results&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The purpose of maintenance measures should be to monitor the health of the maintenance organisation. Where everything is in control, the metrics will reflect the success that has been achieved. Conversely, they should also be used to highlight problem areas and irregularities in order to drive the desired behaviours or areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The graphs in Figure 7 below illustrate some of the benefits that have been realized on the author&amp;rsquo;s site as a result of having a well-functioning maintenance organisation. These graphs form just part of the regular reporting metrics by which the maintenance activities are managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first graph shows the conformance to the weekly planned maintenance schedule. The target is set at 95 percent and is consistently being exceeding across all of the engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Graphs 2 and 3 show how the number of failures has been decreasing month-on-month in one particular work center over the past 12 months, and correspondingly, the mean time between failures has been increasing over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last 2 graphs show machine availability in two of the key work centers where a full re-analysis of all the maintenance requirements was recently conducted using an adapted RCM2 approach. It is clear to see how, in both cases, the equipment availability was far out of control and from the time the improvement activity was started, the availability stabilized and is now still tracking consistently above 90 percent. This has been the result of a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	one is improving the quality of the preventive maintenance routines, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	another is good maintenance planning&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;P&gt;A primary reason that planning fails is that planners do not plan! They do not have time to plan because they are in the wrong time zone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-timezones-fig1.gif" width=200&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows the cycle of maintenance improvement possible through maintenance planning. First, a planner plans a job. Then, a technician works the job. During the job, the technician learns something. The technician records this information as feedback. The next time the job occurs, the planner uses the feedback to improve the job plan.The next technician receives a better job plan. Productivity and quality improve each time the planner improves the plan. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;For example, a pipe flange leaks and a planner plans to break the flange and replace the gasket. On the job later, the technician breaks the spool at both ends. The technician learns that the job really needed two gaskets and records this as feedback. Six months later, the same piping run has a leaking flange and the planner ensures the plan includes two gaskets. Does this matter? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Are maintenance jobs repetitive? Is there opportunity for improvement over time? Yes, yes, yes! Most maintenance jobs are repetitive. The perception they are not stems from different technicians working different jobs over the course of time. A crew might repeat a similar job on the same piece of equipment several times over the course of several years, but each time with a different technician. Yet, maintenance must take the long view and recognize that equipment needs recurring maintenance, often in a similar fashion. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-timezones-fig2.gif" width=200&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 2 shows the planning zone where planners live. Planners live in the future and the past (at the same time!). They live in the future because they plan work that supervisors havenât yet assigned. They plan to head off potential delays and leverage their often-superior experience as top technicians. Nevertheless, they also live in the past as file clerks or librarians researching for helpful information. They want to leverage the experience of the 20 to 30 technicians for which they plan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-timezones-fig3.gif" width=200&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 3 shows that technicians live in the maintenance zone. They live in the present. The technicians work the jobs and learn the lessons. These lessons are not the âlight bulb above the headâ single ideas that transform maintenance. These lessons involve special wrench sizes, recorded part numbers and unusual clearance details that make jobs better each time around. As a whole, these seemingly minute improvements, job-by-job, year-in and year-out, transform maintenance. They feed the files in the planning department. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, many planners do not live in the future or the past. They live in the present. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-timezones-fig4.gif" width=200&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 4 shows planners helping technicians with jobs-in-progress. Technicians often find they need more information after they start assignments. It would seem natural that technicians engage planners (who did not provide the perfect plan) to help. In addition, the planner is often the best suited at finding information quickly to prevent a team of stymied technicians from remaining idle. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=202 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200509_adv-timezones-fig5.gif" width=200&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Yet Figure 5 shows that this seemingly reasonable practice thwarts planningâs effect on long-term maintenance improvement. Many planners are overwhelmed âchasing partsâ for jobs-in-progress and have no time for either planning future jobs or researching past jobs. The cycle of maintenance improvement breaks down. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management must protect planners and allow them to stay in the planning zone. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TD&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility. Publisher McGraw-Hill subsequently sought out Palmer to author the "Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook", first published in 1999 and now in its second edition in 2006.

            <title>What constitutes world-class maintenance and reliability?</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;I have 
received many calls asking, "How can you tell if you are a world-class 
maintenance and reliability organization, or not?" &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;How 
well the systems and practices discussed in this column are being used indicate 
to me how far a plant has to go to become world class in the areas of 
maintenance and reliability. I would suggest reading this column with a group of 
operations and maintenance employees that includes both management and 
craftspeople. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;On a 
scale of zero to 10, rate your plant's use of the following systems and 
practices, with 10 meaning that you are so good that it would probably not pay 
off to do more improvements in this area. A 5 indicates that you feel you do a 
good job, while a zero means that your performance is a disaster. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;1) Assets 
are specified, designed and purchased based on life-cycle cost (LCC) instead of 
lowest cost to buy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that decisions 
on what to buy are based on costs to buy and costs to own an asset over its 
economical life, instead of buying assets solely on purchase price. A 
world-class organization has maintenance professionals involved very early in a 
project. These professionals know how to perform reliability and maintainability 
analyses of systems and components. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, complete bills of materials, training manuals and detailed drawings 
are delivered according to your documented maintenance standards. Also, guards 
allow easy inspections on the run, components requiring frequent maintenance are 
easily accessible, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;2) The 
management team is focusing on the same results.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; Operations, engineering, maintenance and stores are 
working toward the same goal. Your organization is jointly focusing on 
reliability performance, not on cutting costs until it sees what results it 
gets. This means that your whole organization's most important goal is 
competitiveness through manufacturing reliability and cost, rather than focusing 
only on maintenance costs and perceived maintenance downtime. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your overall production efficiency (OPE) continuously increases and, 
consequently, total manufacturing costs decrease. This is very important because 
increasing product throughput to sales generates three to 20 times more revenue 
in a normal market when compared with cutting costs for work done to generate 
the needed reliability for increasing product throughput. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;3) A 
reliability and maintenance policy has been developed and documented that 
includes a three- to five-year improvement plan.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;This policy is communicated to all employees. This means 
that you have described all essential reliability and maintenance elements, 
their key performance indicators, why these are important, how people are being 
recognized when improving toward goals, the importance of reliability for plant 
competitiveness, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your employees are well-informed and motivated to do their part to 
continuously improve toward the same goals. People know which product line to 
prioritize because they know what the market demands. Work priorities are not 
based on emotions. Instead, they are based on what is best for the plant. There 
is a certainty of direction and a good understanding of what the future holds. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;4) 
Craftspeople have a high level of skills and front-line supervision adjusts its 
management style accordingly.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;This means that 
front-line supervisors, team leaders or coordinators do not need to spend much 
time instructing people. Instead, they support them through good planning and 
scheduling of work, identifying individual training needs, organizing this 
training, coaching root cause failure analysis, and other empowering tasks. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you have a thinking and problem-solving organization instead of a 
reactive one. People are enthusiastic about what they do. Their griping level is 
very low, and 10 to 30 percent of all maintenance hours, including crafts 
people's hours, are used on problem-solving and implementation of improvements. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;5) 
Maintenance crafts people's work is limited by their skills, not by rigid craft 
lines.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that you might have only one 
mechanical craft that includes welders, pipefitters, machinists, millwrights, 
etc., and another craft for electricians and instrumentation. However, to have 
this on a piece of paper is not worth anything. Your people are being trained to 
use all necessary skills, and supervisors are assigning work in a way that 
reflects your multiple skills or multi-craft work practices. At the same time, 
while you have work flexibility (horizontal skills), you still have vertical 
skills in areas such as hydraulics and electronics and other areas requiring 
specialists. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, you find it very easy to plan and schedule work because it involves less 
people to do a job that crosses over between traditional craft lines. Your 
crafts people's job satisfaction is also higher after the initial frustration 
created by the change you might have to go through to become more 
flexible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;6) The 
level of planning and scheduling is high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Whatever you call your maintenance program, and whatever 
improvement initiatives you implement, you will find that planning and 
scheduling are at the hub of cost-effective maintenance practices. Even programs 
like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
Reliability-Based Maintenance (RBM) or other three-letter acronyms for 
maintenance programs will soon discover this fact. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before you rate how 
well you think you plan and schedule, it is necessary to understand the basics 
of these concepts. First of all, planning can be described as all work you do in 
order to prepare for a job. These preparations include the final scope of work, 
safety requirements, major steps of work, important clearances, spare parts 
needed and secured as available for when the job is scheduled, special tools, 
scaffolding, skills required, time needed to do the job, and so forth. Secondly, 
scheduling means to decide when the job will be done and who will do it. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The following are some effective guidelines for planning and scheduling. 
When evaluating how well your mill plans and schedules, examine how well you 
follow these practices: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;A. 
Planning is done before scheduling. &lt;BR&gt;B. Planning and scheduling are done 
before execution of the work. &lt;BR&gt;C. Scheduling is done for the work that needs 
to be done. Then, you find and assign the right people to do the work. &lt;BR&gt;D. 
When executing a planned and scheduled job, people are not interrupted to do 
other work. &lt;BR&gt;E. A job is not finished before you have documented why the job 
had to be done. &lt;BR&gt;F. You later find the root cause of any identified problems. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
you implement the above planning and scheduling practices, your results will 
show less use of outside contractors, less unscheduled overtime, increased 
overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), less unscheduled downtime and more free 
time to perform root cause failure analysis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;7) Work is correctly prioritized.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;To prioritize work correctly, you must realize the 
consequences of not doing the work before a given time. Consequences include 
environmental damage/personal injury, high costs for lost production, and/or 
maintenance and asset deterioration. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In 
a plant with multiple product lines, it is necessary, at any given time, to know 
which line is the most important to keep running in order to deliver to the 
customer on time. It is also important to know what the added value is for the 
product. In addition, it should be very difficult to add a job to a closed 
schedule at your mill. As a result, you will have very few changes in your 
weekly/daily and shutdown maintenance schedules. Disciplined priorities will 
also lead to correctly performing planning and scheduling tasks. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;8) Preventive maintenance (PM) and 
essential care and condition monitoring (ECCM) content are right.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; To have the right content in your PM/ECCM program, you 
must base it on the consequences of not preventing the failure as mentioned in 
the previous section. Also, the consequence of a failure must be more 
"expensive" than the cost of trying to prevent it. &lt;BR&gt;The right content also 
includes using the right methods for basic inspections and condition monitoring. 
This means that you do not have "check," "inspect" or such as the only 
descriptions of inspections in your PM/ECCM program. Your methods and 
descriptions must be more precise. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of your PM/ECCM should be done 
while equipment is operating. Very little should be done while equipment is not 
operating due to inspections, fixed-time maintenance overhauls and replacements, 
or other such tasks. Also, PM/ECCM frequencies should be based on failure 
developing time and failure distribution, according to results-oriented 
maintenance teachings. &lt;BR&gt;As a result, your PM/ECCM program will be very 
cost-effective. Also, you will do less PM/ECCM than before you implemented the 
above principles.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;9) PM/ECCM 
execution is 100 percent.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If you have the 
right content in your PM/ECCM program, there is no reason to have less than 100 
percent completion of the PM/ECCM you have implemented. Operators should be 
trained in essential care and inspections of equipment and should perform most 
of these activities when it is practical to do so. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you will have very few, if any, unplanned and unscheduled maintenance 
events. More than half of the work you do during your shutdowns and in 
weekly/daily schedules will be as a result of your PM/ECCM program. This, in 
turn, will give you an opportunity to plan and then schedule more work. Also, a 
good PM/ECCM program is a prerequisite to good planning and scheduling of 
maintenance and, consequently, to increased overall equipment efficiency. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;10) Eighty-five percent of spare parts and 
materials are delivered to the job site.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
planning and scheduling are done correctly, the spare parts store will be in a 
position to effectively deliver spare parts and materials to the job site or to 
designated areas. Or, it will at least stage spare parts in, or close to, the 
store area. As a result, you will have very few people going to the store to get 
parts or waiting at the store window to get what they need. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;11) Service level is 97 percent for the spare parts 
store.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;To maintain a necessary level of trust 
in your store system, the service level â getting the right part when you need 
it â must be very close to 97 percent. If it goes much below that level, people 
will lose trust in your store, and to survive, they will start building their 
own stores without the knowledge of the store's management. This could lead to 
the store's management falling under the false impression that they are doing 
very well in their efforts to reduce the store's inventory, causing them to 
continue their current practices. This will eventually lead to less trust in the 
store's ability to deliver what is needed when it is needed. As a result of good 
and cost-effective management of the spare parts store, you will see that the 
store's inventory value is decreasing with maintaining the service level. Also, 
there will be no unknown and undocumented store items in maintenance areas, 
offices, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;12) The technical database is 
95 percent correct.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The technical database 
should always be up to date. Equipment, loop or electrical circuit identity 
should be the only thing needed to find and request or purchase spare parts or 
other information. As a result, no time is wasted in searching for store items 
or other information.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;13) The 
very basics of maintenance are instituted.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; I 
have mentioned many times before in this series of columns that the only major 
difference between the best performers and others is that the best performers 
implement what others only talk about. Best performers continuously work on 
improving the very basics of maintenance, while others often overlook them. Some 
of the maintenance basics include: &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Detailed cleaning of components &lt;BR&gt;â¢ 
Lubrication &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Alignment &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Balancing &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Filtration &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Operations 
practices. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleaning of components:&lt;/EM&gt; Detailed cleaning of 
components and equipment is often a âno manâs land.â Everybody agrees that it is 
important, but nobody wants to do it. In a world-class reliability and 
maintenance organization, components and equipment are cleaned in detail. Such 
an organization realizes that good inspections canât be done without this level 
of cleaning and that cleaning also extends the life of components. For example, 
the life of electric motors (electric life) varies between five months for a 
dirty motor and more than 20 years for a clean motor. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers also work on continuously 
improving lubrication. Their lubricators â because they do believe they need 
skilled lubricators â are trained in component wear criteria and required 
lubrication. Good lubrication must include such work as improving the choice of 
lubricant, method of lubrication, filtration of oil, cooling systems, prevention 
of water content and removal of water content. There are many examples of how 
this work results in significant life extension, lower lubrication costs and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Alignment and balancing:&lt;/EM&gt; Best 
performers have, and adhere to, alignment standards of, for example, 0.002 
inches or less parallel misalignment for an 8- to 10-inch-diameter coupling 
running at 1,500 rpm in most installations. Precision alignment and balancing of 
rotary assemblies results in reduced levels of vibration, longer component life, 
lower costs and increased equipment reliability. On average, a world-class value 
is 0.1 inches per second or lower. Several experts in this area have shown a 
strong correlation between low vibration level and high reliability and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Filtration:&lt;/EM&gt; Filtration of 
hydraulic fluids, lubrication systems and seal water for mechanical seals is 
very important. In most cases, standard filters are not good enough. If you use 
filters that filter out particles smaller than 5 microns (0.0002 inches), you 
will have much fewer problems with leaking hydraulics, bearings and mechanical 
seals. For example, hydraulics will not leak, bearing life will be extended by 
up to four times and the average life of mechanical seals will be more than 
eight years. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Operations practices:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers teach the 
operators essential care and inspection of components and equipment. This 
includes how to start up and shut down processes and equipment without causing 
any damage. In many mills, it is not uncommon that equipment fails because a 
steam system was started up too fast, causing equipment failures because of 
water hammer and thermal stresses, mechanical seal failure because pumps were 
started up before seal water was turned on to the seals, and so 
forth.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;14) Safety 
standards are very high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Without having enough 
statistical data to make this a proven fact, I am convinced that there is a 
strong relationship between good maintenance practices and a millâs safety 
performance. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The 
average OIR (OSHA Incident Rate = incidents per 200,000 working hours) for the 
U.S. pulp and paper industry is about 8.5, though below 2 is considered good. 
Even given the fact that OIR reporting disciplines differ between mills, a mill 
with a low rating is doing something different than the average mill. Three 
things they do better are maintenance prevention, preventive maintenance, and 
planning and scheduling. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;15) 
Front-line supervision supervises many crafts.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;A good organization needs good supervisors. However, the 
role and management style of a supervisor must change with the skill level of 
their craftspeople. To be effective, systems and procedures must be instituted 
to support the supervisor and the team of craftspeople. If your millâs 
craftspeople have a high level of skills, they do not need detailed technical 
instruction. Instead, they need support in the form of priorities, planning and 
scheduling. Both craftspeople and supervisors must realize that people skills 
are more important than technical skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, your mill will see good teamwork, motivated people and high working 
morale. People will also have more time to work on problem-solving and to 
eliminate sources of failure. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;16) 
Individual training plans are developed and used.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a result of a crafts skills analysis, your mill will 
have individual training plans for each craftsperson and supervisor. Your 
training is than very focused and cost-effective. You measure training by 
increased skill levels, not by the number of training hours. In addition, your 
mill very rarely lacks the skills to do a proficient job. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;17) You 
incorporate root cause failure analysis.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Your 
mill has established a reliability group as task forces or as a separate 
function. You know which problems you should work on, by priority, and you are 
continuously designing out problems. Key people are trained in FMEA (failure 
mode and effects analysis) methodologies and are using these skills to solve 
operations and equipment problems. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In a 
bigger maintenance organization, you have a separate reliability group. Because 
problems are a combination of equipment, operations, people and other factors, 
this group might not report to operations or maintenance but to the mill manager 
or independent engineering manager. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your mill has continuously fewer problems. You do not discuss increasing 
your preventive maintenance efforts, but instead you decrease (optimize) 
predictive maintenance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;18) You 
make full use of time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This column includes a 
table that describes the typical, good, and world-class distribution and use of 
time in a maintenance department. If you take some time to study the figures in 
the table and compare them to how your maintenance department honestly uses its 
time, you might be in for a surprise. Before you do this, however, it is 
necessary to go through the definitions for the categories of work used in the 
table. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Daily and weekly work means all work you can

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Shutdown is all work that requires the 
process to be down in order to do a safe job. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only planned work is for all work executed 
after it has been planned, though it has not been scheduled. In a pulp mill with 
a continuous digester, or for a paper machine and other processes that are 
difficult to start and stop, this category of work is less common than in a 
packaging or finishing area where there are many minor stops and it is easy to 
stop and start equipment. However, it is still very cost-effective to use this 
category where applicable. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only scheduled work is for all work executed 
as scheduled before it has been planned. You can say that you have turned the 
planning and scheduling process upside down. If you do it correctly, however, 
you plan before you schedule. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Break-in work is all work that is added to 
the schedule after it was closed. Closing time for a schedule is recommended to 
be about 19 hours in advance of execution for daily and weekly work. Closing 
time is about one week for shorter shutdowns (10 to 12 hours) and four weeks for 
a longer shutdown (over five days). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Many 
readers of this column have e-mailed me with questions concerning a typical 
evaluation average. Perhaps this question is coming up because you find that 
your millâs ratings are low. We have done more than 250 similar evaluations in 
mills worldwide and the average in most mills is between 4 and 5. Best mills 
rank above 6, and very few are above 7. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Hopefully, this gives you some encouragement. If you rated 
yourselves above 6, you are either very good, or you might be overly optimistic 
or unaware of your actual performance. Remember that we demanded no fewer than 
50 percent crafts people to participate in the evaluations that resulted in the 
above averages. If only management does the evaluation, ratings tend to be 
higher. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>What kind of job plan is that?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Although planning and scheduling is somewhat of an intricate process that we will spend future issues of &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt; examining and discussing, I wanted to spend this very first issue going right to the area of frustration within many existing planning programs. The key frustration comes ultimately from crew supervisors being told not to work unplanned jobs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A crew must respond immediately to a breakdown to restore critical equipment to service. But the job has not been planned yet! If the crew waits to repair the equipment, the supervisor takes a hit. On the other hand, if the crew works without a planned job, the supervisor takes a hit. It does not help that the planner takes a hit as well for not providing a plan in time. This is the definition of frustration and stress. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The plant should allow the supervisors to start truly urgent jobs without plans, but also instruct the planner on how to plan reactive jobs in time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=231 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_job_plan.gif" width=400 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pressed for time? A few simple planning steps can &lt;BR&gt;add meat to a reactive job work order.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the reactive job requiring work soon, the planner cannot do extensive research and plan a job with meticulously detailed steps. Instead, the planner first must simply look at past work orders filed for this equipment. Then, the planner quickly inspects the job site. Next, the planner quickly writes down craft skill and hours required with a general job approach. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So the planner opens the file, peeks at the job, and slaps down craft skill and hours and a scope on the work order. Youâre saying, âWell, what kind of job plan is that? Where are all the job steps and any operations and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) manual information?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Wait a minute. What do you mean by stating, âWhat kind of plan is that?â You didnât even want a job plan. And not only that, now you have several things you wouldnât have on an unplanned job. You have craft skill identified. In the old days, sometimes you assigned a mechanic to a job that needed a welder. The mechanic would then come back (much later) and report that the job needed another craft. In addition, if you did assign the right craft, there was no telling when the job might finish, so you didnât know how much work to assign. Now with the hour estimates, you can assign a full dayâs work to everyone. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Planners do not need to list extensive job steps for 90 percent of maintenance jobs. Think back to the Garden of Eden, when planning did not exist. You expected your technicians to solve problems and take care of job needs. Planning is not trying to replace the need for skilled technicians. Planning is trying to be a library service so that when technicians do find information, including O&amp;amp;M manual information, they can provide that as feedback for planning to file. Then on the next job for that equipment (and there will be one), planners have a duty to include that information from the file of past jobs. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Planners should generally be able to plan all the new reactive work orders in the morning (many times before the first break) and get the reactive work out of the way, often before supervisors assign the work. Then the planners can spend more time putting together job plans for proactive work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And with a planning method that provides time estimates on all the backlogged jobs, planners can prepare weekly schedules for crews. When a crew starts a week with a specific, tailored amount of work to accomplish as a goal, the crew does not sit back on its heels waiting for equipment to break. That is when productivity picks up, and thatâs the ultimate goal of planning. So, itâs a great job plan!&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TD&gt;Doc Palmer, CMRP, has nearly 25 years of industrial experience as a practitioner within the maintenance department of a major electric utility. From 1990 through 1994, he was responsible for overhauling the existing maintenance planning organization. The resulting success played a role in expanding planning to all crafts and stations owned and operated by the utility. Publisher McGraw-Hill subsequently sought out Palmer to author the "Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook", first published in 1999 and now in its second edition in 2006.
