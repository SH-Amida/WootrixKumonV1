    <title>Americaâs Broadband Improves, Cementing a âPersistent Digital Divideâ</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546341/americas-broadband-improves-cementing-a-persistent-digital-divide/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;New figures show that U.S. broadband access is improving, but only for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. broadband infrastructure is improving fast, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/nation-makes-progress-broadband-deployment-challenges-remain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new figures&lt;/a&gt; from the Federal Communications Commission. But the gains are uneven, with people that live in rural areas left behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>This Is How to Stop the Zika Virus</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546331/this-is-how-to-stop-the-zika-virus/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Halting the explosive spread of Zika means waging war with mosquitoes. There are several ways, old and new, to win that war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zika virus is out of control. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization called it an âexplosiveâ epidemic, and officials in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the disease, have admitted that they are âlosing badlyâ to the disease. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff went so far as to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/zika-virus-brazil-war-on-mosquitos-microcephaly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;declare war on &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the mosquito that transmits Zika. Officials in several other countries in the region have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546041/women-asked-to-avoid-pregnancy-as-zika-epidemic-worsens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asked women to consider not getting pregnant&lt;/a&gt; until the epidemic is brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Spam Trail Leads to Chinaâs Three Largest Banks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546311/spam-trail-leads-to-chinas-three-largest-banks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A researcher made 300 purchases of fake luxury goods online and found that 97 percent were handled by Chinaâs largest three banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An academicâs investigation into the underpinnings of the fake luxury goods spam that pollutes in-boxes, social networks, and search results sheds new light on the economics of online crimeâand implicates some of the largest banks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Is Facebook About to Kill Off Twitter?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546286/is-facebook-about-to-kill-off-twitter/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is struggling to grow, its executives are leaving in droves, and now Facebook looks to be muscling in on its turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitterâs stock price has been tumbling for months, and CEO Jack Dorsey announced this week that several of its highest ranking executives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-managementchanges-idUSKCN0V20ZF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are fleeing&lt;/a&gt;. The deepest concern, though, isnât about corporate machinationsâit seems that the product itself simply isnât as compelling as Facebook. Walt Mossberg, one of the better-known tech pundits anywhere, said Twitter had become way too complicated to use and called it â&lt;a href=&quot;http://recode.net/2016/01/27/mossberg-twitter-has-become-secret-handshake-software/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret-handshake software&lt;/a&gt;â that only people who invest huge amounts of time can get full benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Will Machines Eliminate Us?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/546301/will-machines-eliminate-us/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;People who worry that weâre on course to invent dangerously intelligent machines are misunderstanding the state of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoshua Bengio leads one of the worldâs preÃ«minent research groups developing a powerful AI technique known as deep learning. The startling capabilities that deep learning has given computers in recent years, from human-level voice recognition and image classification to basic conversational skills, have prompted warnings about the progress AI is making toward matching, or perhaps surpassing, human intelligence. Prominent figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have even cautioned that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity. Musk and others are investing millions of dollars in researching the potential dangers of AI, as well as possible solutions. But the direst statements sound overblown to many of the people who are actually developing the technology. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, put things in perspective in an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;âs senior editor for AI and robotics, Will Knight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>California Decides the Future for Solar Is Net Metering</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546156/california-decides-the-future-for-solar-is-net-metering/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;New state regulations attempt to strike a balance between rooftop solar owners and utilities in the nationâs largest solar market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a victory for the solar power industry, Californiaâs Public Utility Commission voted Thursday to approve new regulations for net meteringâthe compensation to residential solar power owners for excess electricity that they return to the grid. The regulations will help set a course for distributed renewable energy in the largest solar market in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the powerful anesthetic propofol, researchers have begun to pick apart how human brain activity gives rise to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although doctors have been giving general anesthesia to patients for more than 150 years, the mechanism by which it puts people under is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/426432/the-mystery-behind-anesthesia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a medical mystery&lt;/a&gt;. Unraveling that mechanism could shed light on another mystery: how consciousness works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>How DARPA Took On the Twitter Bot Menace with One Hand Behind Its Back </title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;When DARPA ran a competition to find Twitter bots designed to influence online debates, it inspired a new generation of anti-bot strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more disturbing phenomena on Twitter is the proliferation of bots that generate tweets automatically in an attempt to spread spam, to make money illicitly through click fraud, and, most worryingly, to influence the discussion on topics such as terrorism and politics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Problem with Biofuels</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546196/the-problem-with-biofuels/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy is touting its âGreat Green Fleet,â but why havenât biofuels made a bigger splash despite a decade of hype and investment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week the U.S. Navy, with its accustomed pomp and fanfare, launched its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/21/us-navy-launches-first-biofuel-powered-aircraft-carriers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first carrier strike group powered partly by biofuelâ&lt;/a&gt;in this case, a blend made primarily from beef fat. The biofueled warships form a central element of the Navyâs &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil/energy/great-green-fleet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Great Green Fleet&lt;/a&gt; program to draw half of its power from clean energy sources, rather than petroleum, by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
