            <title>Apex Power Tools to Open New Maintenance Facility in Kentucky</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Apex Power Tools North America operation recently announced the opening of a new service and aftermarket center for all U.S. maintenance and repair operations near the UPS Worldport Air Freight hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Featuring 28,000 square feet, the high-throughput service center is being created to consolidate the company&amp;rsquo;s U.S. service centers into one convenient location. The service center will begin operations May 1, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our new service center is designed to significantly improve turnaround time for our U.S. customers to a target of five to seven business days,&amp;quot; said Ken Kaszubinski of Apex Tool Group. &amp;quot;With high throughput and improved logistics, we will be able to offer 20 times our current service flow capacity for motor vehicle, aerospace, and high-end general industry fastening and material removal products.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the service center&amp;rsquo;s close proximity to the UPS Worldport Freight facility, Apex Tool Group can provide efficient transportation of service and aftermarket products. The service center will accommodate scheduled preventative and predictive maintenance onsite to allow for 24-hour turnaround time from receipt of goods to return shipment. Repair and test areas will also be available for electronic controllers, cable, angle heads, electric tools, pneumatic tools and advanced drilling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The ability to share real-time service performance data enhances our parts coordination and management of customer KPIs,&amp;quot; added Kaszubinski. &amp;quot;This ensures we are providing superior value and customer service, and high-quality hand and power tool restoration using certified processes while reducing overall costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training will also be a key element of the new facility, which will have a full-time aftermarket technical trainer for Apex Tool Group&amp;rsquo;s sales, marketing and service personnel as well as for distributor partners and customers. An ISO quality management system and ISO 17025-accredited calibration laboratory will also be deployed at the site to ensure products comply with industry certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Maintenance Strategies for Special Tools </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We all accumulate special fixtures, lifting frames, carts, transport pallets and piping inserts that are infrequently used but save time and enhance safety when their time comes. What you do with these special tools in between determines whether you get that savings and safety boost again or if you have to make the same investment over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What kind of an investment? If you do the job infrequently, you have to retake the measurements, find the stock material, fabricate the pieces and verify the fits. None of this is cheap, and it usually happens in the middle of a job when you can least afford the time or diversion of labor. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously not cost effective to do it over and over again, so why not make the first time count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure that it will ever be used again, wait until things calm down and then evaluate the item. If it was a once-in-a-century affair, trash it and move on. If it looks like something that will be used again, record the dimensions and take pictures. Digital pictures can be inserted into or linked to a document for that equipment file or the file for that special job, and it helps explain the application of the item if you can take some pictures of it in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Color-coding your special tools is also a good practice. Pick a color scheme that is unique and make sure everyone knows that anything painted that color, no matter how much it looks like junk, is to be preserved and returned to shop storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labeling that special tool or fixture is another must, as well as its storage container. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen special tools painted a fluorescent yellow with numbers stenciled on them that were several years old. The yellow was their special color that was easy to recognize from a distance, and the number corresponded to a file folder that contained a scaled drawing, a detailed description and a step-by-step procedure on how to use it (with photos). Employees at that plant knew what the color meant and how to find the file on the specific item. They also knew that destroying or trashing a special tool was a termination offense at that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The good part about the unique ID number is that it allows you to reference it in work orders, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and bills of materials (BOMs). Add a designated, labeled storage spot and you get maximum value from your first-time expense. Another advantage is that if you have similar equipment at multiple plants, you can ship the tools or fixtures as needed and leverage the investment even further. This saves overall costs and increases reliability as jobs get done easier, faster and probably better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you manufacture equipment and you use special tools and fixtures during assembly, you may even open a new revenue stream by renting them to customers during major rebuilds or modifications. Just loaning them out for free builds customer loyalty and improves your equipment reputation for maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a simple, rare-use specialty item is one from my own past. We needed to move 3,200-pound grinding roller assemblies around every fall during mill overhauls at a brewery. This process involved going in and out of elevators, plus maneuvering through some tight doorways and passages. These assemblies could crush feet and break legs if they got away, and their awkward shape made them difficult to fit onto off-the-shelf carts, so it was important to have control of them at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our technicians initially designed an all-steel cart that ran about $3,500 each to have built, but after one of only two disappeared during a plant expansion phase, we went low-tech for the replacements. Our carpenter contractor bolted together replacement carts from 4-by-4s, three-quarter-inch plywood and heavy-duty casters with angle-iron capture brackets at the corners. The carts&amp;rsquo; wood protected the roller surface profiles, and the four swivel casters allowed for perfect control into and out of tight spaces. The low profile kept the center of balance low to minimize tipping concerns. The carts stacked for storage in a designated location until needed the next fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At only $800 each, we got six for the price of one steel cart, so that simplified handling the three rebuilt assemblies and the three old assemblies without the need for much handling during the job. Pre-staging was a snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lesson here is that a low-tech solution is sometimes the most cost-effective one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key lesson is that you need to control your specialty items so that they are there when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if it will be used again in your lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make a dimensional drawing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number, label and color-code it if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create a file for it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Include how-to procedures and photos of it in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Designate a storage location that is labeled and record it in the equipment master file.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Refer to it in your work procedures and SOPs.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>The Hidden Costs of Manual Tool Tracking</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I recently had a fascinating discussion with a friend who performs materials inspections for one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest suppliers of aircraft parts and assemblies. His company had just switched from manual materials tracking to radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based tracking, and he calculated that the changeover had already saved them hundreds of thousands of dollars &amp;mdash; maybe more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before they adopted RFID, materials frequently left his inspection facility and failed to make it to their intended destinations. Sometimes they were tracked down, and other times orders valued at as much as $300,000 vanished forever. RFID has entirely solved this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is an excellent example of the savings RFID can bring to a large operation. Although his story relates to materials inventory, tool tracking offers similar opportunities to reduce losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material losses are easier to measure. When one-third of a million dollars&amp;rsquo; worth of composite fabric vanishes into thin air, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing complicated or ambiguous about the cost. When a tool is missing or poorly calibrated, less visible losses appear on other parts of the balance sheet (beyond the direct cost of the tool, which can be significant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you add up these costs, the adoption of RFID tool tracking can make as much financial sense as RFID materials tracking. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few examples of indirect losses and some unprecedented opportunities related to the automation of tool tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lost Tools Increase Operating Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most manufacturers invest in sophisticated software systems for everything from resource planning to project management, yet their tool-tracking systems are entirely manual. When tools go missing, the benefits of the other software programs lose effectiveness in terms of on-time performance and labor efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Product Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A poorly calibrated tool cannot produce consistent product quality, which can increase quality-control costs, or worse yet, damage a company&amp;rsquo;s reputation. These are difficult costs to track, but they are every bit as damaging to the bottom line as tool-replacement costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tool Tracking to Augment Project Management Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RFID tool tracking can add new value to manufacturing processes when used in conjunction with project management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.&amp;nbsp;The use of a specific tool often represents a process step, and work orders often specify that tool. This means that work in process and tool inventory can be tracked simultaneously, providing a real-time view of order tracking and capital allocations. This introduces new profit in the form of production efficiency, especially in this age of just-in-time delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It also allows tool inventory, preventative maintenance and calibration to be managed across multiple facilities, which reduces spare inventory and improves asset utilization across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, my friend&amp;rsquo;s company has not yet adopted RFID tool tracking or RFID inventory control beyond the incoming materials stage. But they are getting there, and so is the rest of the manufacturing world.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DeWalt, Empire Level agree to end private-label partnership</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	DeWalt, the leading manufacturer of industrial power tools and accessories, and Empire Level Manufacturing Corporation, the industry leader in developing accurate levels and measuring tools, announced today that they will end their partnership on the private label line of professional box levels that Empire Level licensed, designed and manufactured in 2010 under the DeWalt brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In February 2010, the companies launched the DeWalt levels in retailers nationwide after many months of development, and the products enjoyed strong sales success. However, the acquisition of DeWalt by Stanley Works in 2010, created an undesirable competitive situation, and both parties felt the best action moving forward was to end the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re disappointed that this agreement didn&amp;rsquo;t work out as planned, but we certainly understand that a partner who becomes a direct competitor through acquisition is an untenable situation, and we&amp;rsquo;re pleased that an amicable resolution has been reached,&amp;rdquo; said Jenni Becker, president of Empire Level Manufacturing Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Though we enjoyed working with Empire Level, we&amp;rsquo;re pleased that we were able to come to an agreement to exit our partnership, which pre-existed the acquisition and was no longer appropriate for either brand,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Ervin, director of new business development, DeWalt. &amp;ldquo;Empire Level has been a great partner and we wish them well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/Gfv9ATbAqHA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Robert Bosch Tool Corporation appoints new president/CEO</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Robert Bosch Tool Corporation announced on January 13 that Terry Horan will succeed Manfred Seitz as president and chief executive officer, effective April 1, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seitz will retire the end of March 2011 as chairman, president, and chief executive officer of the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation after 34 successful years leading several different divisions of the Bosch Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Seitz joined Bosch in 1977, after completing a degree in economics, and began his career in the Blaupunkt division. He had increasingly critical roles in various Bosch divisions around the world, spending the last seven years in the United States at Power Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a long-term focus on sustaining the future, Seitz led Power Tools through the last few years of challenging economic conditions in the construction industry to a strong finish in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Horan has led the worldwide Rotary Tool business of the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation for the past six years, engineering a successful turnaround for the Dremel brand resulting in double-digit sales increases over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 25-year veteran of the Home Improvement Industry in North America, Horan has a strong sales, marketing and general management background. He has spent 13 years with Bosch Power Tools leading both the SKIL brand during the Emerson Electric&amp;ndash;Bosch joint venture period and, more recently, as president of the Rotary Tools business, which includes Dremel and RotoZip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Horan holds an MBA degree from the University of Notre Dame and a BS Marketing degree from Northern Illinois University. He is actively involved on academic and athletic boards and advisory councils at Northern Illinois University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A native of Mount Prospect, Ill., the home of Robert Bosch Tool Corporation in North America, Horan is a local leader with industry acumen and strong community ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Bosch &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services. In the areas of automotive and industrial technology, consumer good and building technology, some 275,000 associates generated sales of $53 billion (38.2 billion euros) in fiscal 2009. The Bosch Group comprises Robert Bosch GmbH and its more than 300&amp;nbsp;subsidiaries and regional companies in over 60 countries. If its sales and service partners are included, then Bosch is represented in roughly 150 countries. This worldwide development, manufacturing, and sales network is the foundation for growth. Each year, Bosch spends more than $5 billion (3.5 billion euros) for research and development, and applies for some 3,800 patents worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/XSOhgUrXDq0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Wilson Tool acquires Exacta Precision and Exacta FabTool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Wilson Tool International on November 3 announced that it has acquired Exacta Precision and Exacta FabTool of Toronto. Like Wilson Tool, Exacta has been a supplier of high-quality tooling for the fabrication and stamping industries since the mid-1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The merger of these great family-owned companies represents a strong step forward for our organizations,&amp;quot; said Brian Robinson, CEO of Wilson Enterprises. &amp;quot;Each company will immediately enhance their product offerings and geographical coverage, which, in the end, is great news for our customers across North America and beyond.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of these strong Canadian manufacturing organizations continues to extend Wilson Tool&amp;#39;s increasing global manufacturing capabilities. By expanding manufacturing operations in the USA, England, China and now Canada, Wilson Tool is better able to serve its growing customer base around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There will be no immediate change in operations for the companies. However, as the integration process moves forward, both Exacta and Wilson Tool customers will benefit greatly from the increased availability of existing product lines each manufacturer brings to the table as well as additional product lines to be made available soon. With the combination of the two sales forces, customers of both companies will also experience enhanced customer service and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/iaSPMN7TXpo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Back to basics: How to measure electricity with a clamp meter</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A clamp meter is an electrical tester that combines a basic digital multimeter with a current sensor. Clamps measure current. Probes measure voltage. Having a hinged &amp;ldquo;clamp&amp;rdquo; jaw integrated into an electrical meter allows users to simply clamp around wire, cables and other conductors at any point in the electrical system and measure its current, without disconnecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What do clamp meters measure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any of these: AC current, AC and DC voltage, resistance, continuity, and, with some models, DC current, capacitance, temperature, frequency and more&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Typically measure to the nearest tenth of a unit (rather than the milli-units you find in a full-function multimeter), making them perfect for electrical work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Who uses them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industrial maintenance technicians&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control technicians&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electricians &amp;ndash; in-house and contractors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Facilities, building maintenance and HVAC technicians&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Service organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What are they used on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industrial equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industrial controls&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electrical systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Commercial/industrial HVAC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What do they use them for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Repairing existing systems on an as-needed basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Installation: &lt;/strong&gt;Troubleshooting installation problems, performing final circuit tests and supervising apprentice electricians while installing electrical equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; Performing scheduled and preventive maintenance on electro-mechanical systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why use a clamp meter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Industrial situations often call for simultaneous measurement as part of troubleshooting, so many of those users carry two meters: one to measure electrical current and one to measure voltage. For electricians, a clamp meter is a quick and versatile diagnostic tool for figuring out why an electrical system or piece of equipment is not operating correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s inrush?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Large machinery often requires a big surge of electricity to get started &amp;ndash; electricians have to make sure the rest of the system can support that occasional big surge in demand. That surge is called inrush and it causes other problems than just overall supply. Fluke clamps use proprietary technology to filter out electrical &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; and capture the starting current exactly as the circuit protection sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s different about the new clamps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The flexible coil and the extended measurement ranges help solve these common issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tight cabinets and bundled wires that make it difficult to use a regular clamp meter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Large or awkward conductors a regular clamp meter can&amp;rsquo;t get around to measure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Needing a co-worker&amp;rsquo;s help to get a measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Wanting to measure more than 1,000 amps AC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Where to learn more &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The following Fluke Web site, &lt;a href="http://www.Fluke.com/Motors_Drives"&gt;www.Fluke.com/Motors_Drives&lt;/a&gt;, lists clamp meter ABCs, application notes, case studies, a discussion board, videos and other resources that help explain how to use clamp meters for troubleshooting motors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/CLFh8hCfUHA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The daily grind: Test your knowledge on grinder safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	A worker steps up to an abrasive wheel grinder and places a piece of metal against the wheel&amp;rsquo;s spinning surface. But because the machine was not adjusted correctly, the metal catches in the grinder. A split-second later, the grinding wheel explodes, sending stony chunks, as deadly as shrapnel, shooting through the shop. The worker drops lifeless to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	Tragic scenarios like that have been known to happen in workplaces across the country. An Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) examination of 27 grinder wheel accidents in an eight-year period revealed that 26 percent of those accidents resulted in employee deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Because abrasive wheel grinders are everyday equipment in workplaces nationwide, many workers become complacent about their hazards,&amp;rdquo; said Benjamin W. Mangan, founder and president of MANCOMM, a company which develops and publishes regulatory compliance products. &amp;ldquo;Improper use of a grinding wheel, or the use of one that is defective or damaged, can cause the wheel to break up. And those flying fragments can be deadly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	To help America&amp;rsquo;s workers stay safe, MANCOMM developed and released the Grinder Safety Training CD. This CD can help workers to improve safety and minimize risk by focusing on a personal protection system for pedestal and bench grinders. Topics covered include personal protective equipment, grinder and grinding wheel RPM compatibility, ring tests, grinding wheel installation, guard adjustment, and aluminum oxide grinding wheels. The Grinder Safety Training CD is the first release in MANCOMM&amp;rsquo;s new Safety Interactive Training Experience (SITE) product line. SITE products use multimedia presentations which actively engage trainees in user-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Grinder Safety Awareness Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	How familiar are you with abrasive wheel grinders and their safe operation? Take this quiz and find out. These questions were derived from the audio portion of the MANCOMM Grinder Safety Training CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	This quiz offers an answer selection for each question. The skill checks on the actual Grinder Safety Training CD are not &amp;ldquo;multiple guess&amp;rdquo;, but multimedia demonstrations. Once the employee passes the CD&amp;rsquo;s interactive skill checks, you will know they can operate a pedestal and bench grinder safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1. Why should eye protection be used when operating a grinder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To protect the worker&amp;rsquo;s eyes from sparks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To protect the worker&amp;rsquo;s eyes from flying fragments, if the wheel breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To protect the eyes from ultraviolet rays created by the hot metal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A and B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2. Which of these are forms of personal protective equipment you may need while using a grinder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eye protection.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Respirator.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ear plugs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All of the above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you wear jewelry while operating a grinder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The sparks will tarnish silver or gold.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It could get caught in the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The fumes will cause gems to become cloudy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It&amp;rsquo;s considered bad luck in many workplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. Why would you want to tap a grinding wheel with the non-metallic handle of a screwdriver?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You would never want to do that. It could hurt the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the wheel makes a ringing noise, you will know it is not fit for use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It&amp;rsquo;s part of a test to check the usability of the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tapping a grinding wheel shakes any impurities out of its pores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5. When gauging the compatibility between a grinder&amp;rsquo;s RPM and a grinding wheel&amp;rsquo;s RPM, remember:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The two numbers must be exactly the same.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The two numbers are not connected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The RPM of the grinder is always twice that of the grinding wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		None of the above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6. When you need to put a new wheel on your grinder, what should you do with the wheel first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Nothing. If it&amp;rsquo;s a new wheel, straight out of its packaging, just put it right on the grinder.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Give it a &amp;lsquo;ring test&amp;rsquo; to make sure it is suitable for use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Prepare it for use by soaking it in water for no less than three minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Roll it across the floor to make sure it is perfectly round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7. How much of a gap should there be between the work rest and the face of the grinding wheel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1/8&amp;rdquo; or less&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No less than 1/8&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1/4&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8. If your grinder requires repairs, what kind of replacement parts should you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any kind that will fit. Parts for most brands of grinders are interchangeable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Only manufacturer-recommended replacement parts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Only parts purchased from the same store as the grinder.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		None of the above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9. The wheel hole diameter and the grinder arbor size are not the same. What can you do to make the wheel workable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The wheel is not compatible with the grinder. Do not install it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Go ahead and install it, even if you have to force the wheel onto the spindle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Screw on the wheel nut especially tight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		B and C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;10. What kind of material can you grind with aluminum oxide grinding wheels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Only aluminum.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any type of metal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any metal with a yellow, gold or amber hue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ferrous or iron-based materials, like iron or steel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	How many wrong answers are permissible? In the workplace, it is zero. Whenever workers operate an abrasive wheel grinder incorrectly, such incidents raise the possibility of accidents, injuries or death, which in turn can lead to workers&amp;rsquo; compensation expenses, raised insurance premiums, lost productivity, lowered employee morale, and OSHA penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the workplace, knowledge is power,&amp;rdquo; Mangan said, &amp;ldquo;and we want all workers to have the power to work safely and with skilled confidence. A knowledgeable worker is a happy, productive worker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;

	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style2"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="style3"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;QUIZ ANSWERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DEWALT unveils new 12-volt lithium-ion cordless system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	DEWALT on September 17 announced the launch of its new 12-volt MAX Lithium-Ion platform that includes a 1/4-inch Screwdriver (DCF610S2), 3/8&amp;quot; Drill/Driver (DCD710S2), 1/4&amp;quot; Impact Driver (DCF815S2), 3/8&amp;quot; Impact Wrench (DCF813S2), LED Work Light (DCL510), Inspection Camera (DCT410S1), Infrared Thermometer (DCT414S1) and two combo kits (DCK210S2 and DCK211S2). The platform was designed to incorporate comfort and a compact design with the power and industry-leading features contractors need on the jobsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 12-volt MAX tools and instruments are ideal for a number of users including remodelers, electricians, cabinet installers, plumbers, service technicians, maintenance and woodworkers. The system has been built to handle a variety of drilling, fastening and measurement applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All products in the system feature a 12-volt MAX Lithium-Ion battery that charges in 40 minutes. The battery is strategically placed at the bottom of the handle to allow for the patented contoured grip. This configuration provides comfort and balance and allows contractors to easily stand the tool on its battery between uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;To achieve the desired grip for these tools, our team spent time constructing prototypes and studying Anthropometric guides that detail the different hand shapes and sizes,&amp;quot; said Dan Lopano, industrial design manager for DEWALT. &amp;quot;This effort, combined with our advanced CAD technologies and focus on user satisfaction, has produced a line of products that exceeds the comfort and balance of other tools in the market today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each tool in the system incorporates features to improve overall performance on the job. For instance, three LED lights on the screwdriver, impact driver and impact wrench provide visibility without shadows. A new 1/4-inch hex chuck on the impact driver and screwdriver allows users to simply push the bit in with one hand to lock it in place, and it accepts a 1-inch bit tip to fit into the tight spaces. A wireless, removable screen on the inspection camera is ideal for accessing tight areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DEWALT-designed electronics are built in the switches of all 12V MAX tools, instruments &amp;amp; lights. These electronics provide maximum life for the tools and batteries by protecting them from overheating, overloading and deep discharge during use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 12-volt MAX platform will be available beginning in the fourth quarter at home centers and industrial distributors. The products in the system are expected to retail from $139 to $299. The tools will come with a three-year limited warranty, one year free service contract and 90-day money back guarantee. Additionally, there are a number of DEWALT accessories that are compatible with the tools in this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About DEWALT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DEWALT is a leading manufacturer of industrial power tools and accessories, with more than 300 power tool and equipment products, as well as 1,000 power tool accessories, including corded and cordless drills, saws, hammers, grinders, routers, planers, plate joiners, sanders, lasers, generators, compressors, nailers, saw blades, metal and masonry drill bits, abrasives, screw driving accessories and more. DEWALT tools can be found nationally and internationally, wherever tools are sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/wv4snwGG3YI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Cooper Industries and Danaher announce closing of tools joint venture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cooper Industries plc and Danaher Corporation on July 6 announced the completion of the joint venture combining Cooper&amp;rsquo;s Tools business with certain tools businesses from Danaher Corporation&amp;rsquo;s Tools and Components segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The joint venture, which was previously announced in March 2010, will be named Apex Tool Group LLC. Under the joint venture agreement, Cooper and Danaher each will own a 50 percent share of the new company and have equal representation on the joint venture&amp;rsquo;s board of directors. Steve Breitzka, former president of Danaher Tool Group, will lead the joint venture as chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are extremely excited about the creation of this global tools business with Danaher, which we expect to deliver long-term value creation to our shareholders, customers and employees. We are confident that the joint venture&amp;rsquo;s management team will successfully capitalize on the synergies that are inherent in combining these two businesses. Cooper will continue to focus on growing our core electrical products business by executing on our organic growth initiatives of customer loyalty, innovation and globalization and utilizing our exceptionally strong balance sheet for strategic acquisitions,&amp;rdquo; said Cooper Industries chairman and CEO Kirk S. Hachigian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is anticipated that Cooper will recognize a net after-tax loss in the second quarter of 2010 related to the transaction currently estimated at approximately $90 million or $0.53 per share. This non-cash loss will be principally related to the recognition of the cumulative currency translation. Excluding the effect of the non-cash loss, it is anticipated that the joint venture will have an immaterial impact on Cooper&amp;rsquo;s 2010 forecasted free cash flow and earnings per share. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, the Tools Segment will be deconsolidated in Cooper&amp;rsquo;s consolidated financial statements and reflected as an equity investment on Cooper&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet and as equity earnings from a joint venture in the consolidated income statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Consumers can now shop sears.com for a full line of products from Hitachi, including lithium-ion drill/drivers, power saws, routers, work lights and more. With a reputation for superior design and unsurpassed durability, the power tool collection from Hitachi brings another innovative brand to Sears&amp;#39; tool department.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Danaher, Cooper Industries to combine tool businesses, form new company</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Danaher Corporation and Cooper Industries plc on March 26 announced they have reached an agreement to combine their respective tool businesses, Danaher Tool Group and Cooper Tools, in a joint venture. Cooper and Danaher will each hold a 50 percent ownership stake in the new joint venture and Danaher Tool Group executive Steve Breitzka will lead the new company as its president and chief executive officer. The company will be headquartered in Sparks, Md., and its board of directors will consist of six members with three members appointed by each of the parent companies. The leadership team will include both Cooper Tools and Danaher Tool Group executives. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close after securing the necessary regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be named in the coming weeks, the combined company will market some of the leading brands in the tool industry, such as Allen, Apex, Armstrong Tools, Campbell, Cleco, Crescent, Erem, GearWrench, H.K. Porter, Jacobs Chuck, Jobox, K-D Tools, Lufkin, Nicholson, Plumb, Sata, Weller and Wiss, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The combined company will bring together two major manufacturers with complementary product offerings, distribution channels and geographic reach. Together, the combined company will provide a broader array of hand and power tools to a more diverse range of end users in the do-it-yourself, manufacturing and assembly, automotive, construction, and electrical trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, professional operators, mechanics and technicians in manufacturing production, assembly and maintenance organizations will have more product choice through national and independent distribution partners. The company will also sell its products to consumers through established partnerships with major global retailers. This includes private-label products and the companies&amp;#39; owns brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Combining the strengths of each company is expected to translate into significant benefits for our collective customers across the globe,&amp;quot; said Breitzka. &amp;quot;In addition to offering a wider and deeper line-up of leading tool brands, we expect to be better positioned to drive new product innovation - a hallmark of both businesses - with shared engineering resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;World-class quality, service and innovation are becoming increasingly important to our distributors and end users,&amp;quot; said Laura Ulz, who currently serves as the president of Cooper Tools. &amp;quot;Size and scale are important in this industry and this combination will create a focused, global tools business with an improved ability to continue to meet the evolving needs of our professional and retail customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The companies expect that customers will be able to continue to purchase products and receive customer service through the existing channels.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturing technology consumption in January 26% higher than year ago</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	January U.S. manufacturing technology consumption totaled $130.96 million, according to AMTDA, the American Machine Tool Distributors&amp;rsquo; Association, and AMT &amp;ndash; The Association For Manufacturing Technology in a report published on March 8. This total, as reported by companies participating in the USMTC program, was down 40.3 percent&amp;nbsp;from December but up 26.2 percent from the total of $103.77 million reported for January 2009.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	These numbers and all data in this report are based on the totals of actual data reported by companies participating in the USMTC program.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Many customers placed orders in December to take advantage of tax relief measures, pulling orders out of January 2010,&amp;rdquo; said AMTDA president&amp;nbsp;Peter Borden. &amp;ldquo;The good news is that January 2010 orders are still 26 percent ahead of January 2009. Fortunately, there are measures moving through Congress that will expand these benefits, incentivizing manufacturers to invest in capital equipment in 2010.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The United States Manufacturing Technology Consumption (USMTC) report, jointly compiled by the two trade associations representing the production and distribution of manufacturing technology, provides regional and national U.S. consumption data of domestic and imported machine tools and related equipment. Analysis of manufacturing technology consumption provides a reliable leading economic indicator as manufacturing industries invest in capital metalworking equipment to increase capacity and improve productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	U.S. manufacturing technology consumption is also reported on a regional basis for five geographic breakdowns of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Northeast Region&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;January manufacturing technology consumption in the Northeast Region totaled $25.88 million, down 40.5 percent when compared with the $43.49 million total for December but up 31.4 percent when compared with January a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Southern Region&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Totaling $28.51 million, Southern Region manufacturing technology consumption in January fell 3.6 percent below December&amp;rsquo;s $29.57 million but was 95.8 percent higher than the total for January 2009.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Midwest Region&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;With a total of $37.41 million, Midwest Region manufacturing technology consumption in January was 39.9 percent less than December&amp;rsquo;s $62.22 million but up 31.2 percent when compared with January a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Central Region&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At $27.10 million, January manufacturing technology consumption in the Central Region was down 50.6 percent from December&amp;rsquo;s $54.81 million but up 6.0 percent when compared with January a year ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Western Region&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Western Region manufacturing technology consumption in January fell 58.7 percent to $12.06 million when compared with December&amp;rsquo;s $29.22 million and was down 21.8 percent when compared with January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. power &amp; hand tool demand to reach $14.5B in 2012</title>

Although difficult in the shorter term, the U.S. construction outlook is expected to recover by 2012, creating demand in the professional sector. In the meantime, consumer demand will benefit from continued interest in DIY and home remodeling activities. Ongoing introduction of new products â especially improved cordless tools â will create gains in both markets.

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"&gt;Growth in consumer tool demand will outpace that of the professional segment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;, benefitting from the ongoing popularity of do-it-yourself activities and the trade-up by consumers to feature-laden power tools. The U.S. mortgage crisis will compel many homeowners to remain in their current homes, thereby boosting home remodeling and repair activity. A growing number of women have become interested in DIY activities, as evidenced by Web sites and classes geared toward this group.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"&gt;Although the professional market will grow more slowly than the consumer market&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;, professional users will continue to account for the majority of overall tool demand through 2012. The construction sector will post the best gains through 2012, reflecting an expected recovery in housing starts. In addition, the aging U.S. housing stock will boost demand for contractors in remodeling and repair jobs. The automotive aftermarket sector will benefit from the growing number and average age of vehicles in use. As some consumers forgo buying a new car, this will increase demand for automotive repairs. The industrial sector, however, will be dampened by declining employment as a greater portion of the population becomes employed in the services sector.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"&gt;Maintaining established trends, power tool demand is forecast to outpace hand tool demand&lt;B&gt; &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;due to the continuing popularity of cordless electric products such as saws, sanders and screwdrivers. Hand tool demand is limited by the inherent durability of these products. Common household tools such as hammers frequently outlive their owners, dampening replacement demand.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"&gt;Cordless products will continue to post the best gains&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;, benefitting not only from macroeconomic factors but from their performance advantages vis-a-vis plug-in models. The development of improved battery technology, such as lithium-ion chemistry, has encouraged both consumers and professionals to use cordless technology.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/power_tools/~4/tDaOmY8S5yI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>A comprehensive guide to hand tool and power tool safety</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Tools are such a common part of our lives that it is difficult to remember that they may pose hazards. All tools are manufactured with safety in mind but, tragically, a serious accident often occurs before steps are taken to search out and avoid or eliminate tool-related hazards.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the process of removing or avoiding the hazards, workers must learn to recognize the hazards associated with the different types of tools and the safety precautions necessary to prevent those hazards.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hand tools hazards&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hand tools are non-powered. They include anything from axes to wrenches. The greatest hazards posed by hand tools result from misuse and improper maintenance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some examples: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Using a screwdriver as a chisel may cause the tip of the screwdriver to break and fly, hitting the user or other employees. 
&lt;LI&gt;If a wooden handle on a tool such as a hammer or an axe is loose, splintered or cracked, the head of the tool may fly off and strike the user or another worker. 
&lt;LI&gt;A wrench must not be used if its jaws are sprung because it might slip. 
&lt;LI&gt;Impact tools such as chisels, wedges or drift pins are unsafe if they have mushroomed heads. The heads might shatter on impact, sending sharp fragments flying. 
&lt;LI&gt;The employer is responsible for the safe condition of tools and equipment used by employees, but the employees have the responsibility for properly using and maintaining tools. 
&lt;LI&gt;Employers should caution employees that saw blades, knives or other tools be directed away from aisle areas and other employees working in close proximity. Knives and scissors must be sharp. Dull tools can be more hazardous than sharp ones. 
&lt;LI&gt;Appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., safety goggles, gloves, etc.) should be worn due to hazards that may be encountered while using portable power tools and hand tools. 
&lt;LI&gt;Safety requires that floors be kept as clean and dry as possible to prevent accidental slips with or around dangerous hand tools. 
&lt;LI&gt;Around flammable substances, sparks produced by iron and steel hand tools can be a dangerous ignition source. Where this hazard exists, spark-resistant tools made from brass, plastic, aluminum or wood will provide for safety. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Power tool precautions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Power tools can be hazardous when improperly used. There are several types of power tools, based on the power source they use: electric, pneumatic, liquid fuel, hydraulic and powder-actuated.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Employees should be trained in the use of all tools â not just power tools. They should understand the potential hazards as well as the safety precautions to prevent those hazards from occurring.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The following general precautions should be observed by power tool users: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Never carry a tool by the cord or hose. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never yank the cord or the hose to disconnect it from the receptacle. 
&lt;LI&gt;Keep cords and hoses away from heat, oil and sharp edges. 
&lt;LI&gt;Disconnect tools when not in use, before servicing and when changing accessories such as blades, bits and cutters. 
&lt;LI&gt;All observers should be kept at a safe distance away from the work area. 
&lt;LI&gt;Secure work with clamps or a vise, freeing both hands to operate the tool. 
&lt;LI&gt;Avoid accidental starting. The worker should not hold a finger on the switch button while carrying a plugged-in tool. 
&lt;LI&gt;Tools should be maintained with care. They should be kept sharp and clean for the best performance. Follow instructions in the userâs manual for lubricating and changing accessories. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be sure to keep good footing and maintain good balance. 
&lt;LI&gt;The proper apparel should be worn. Loose clothing, ties or jewelry can become caught in moving parts. 
&lt;LI&gt;All portable electric tools that are damaged shall be removed from use and tagged âDo Not Use.â &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Guards&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Hazardous moving parts of a power tool need to be safeguarded. For example, belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, fly wheels, chains or other reciprocating, rotating or moving parts of equipment must be guarded if such parts are exposed to contact by employees.&lt;BR&gt;Guards, as necessary, should be provided to protect the operator and others from the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;point of operation, 
&lt;LI&gt;in-running nip points, 
&lt;LI&gt;rotating parts, and 
&lt;LI&gt;flying chips and sparks. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Safety guards must never be removed when a tool is being used. For example, portable circular saws must be equipped with guards. An upper guard must cover the entire blade of the saw. A retractable lower guard must cover the teeth of the saw, except when it makes contact with the work material. The lower guard must automatically return to the covering position when the tool is withdrawn from the work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Safety switches&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The following hand-held powered tools must be equipped with a momentary contact âon-offâ control switch: drills, tappers, fastener drivers, horizontal, vertical and angle grinders with wheels larger than 2 inches in diameter, disc and belt sanders, reciprocating saws, saber saws, and other similar tools. These tools also may be equipped with a lock-on control provided that turnoff can be accomplished by a single motion of the same finger or fingers that turn it on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The following hand-held powered tools may be equipped with only a positive âon-offâ control switch: platen sanders, disc sanders with discs 2 inches or less in diameter; grinders with wheels 2 inches or less in diameter; routers, planers, laminate trimmers, nibblers, shears, scroll saws and jigsaws with blade shanks.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Other hand-held powered tools such as circular saws having a blade diameter greater than 2 inches, chain saws and percussion tools without positive accessory holding means must be equipped with a constant pressure switch that will shut off the power when the pressure is released.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Electric tools&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Employees using electric tools must be aware of several dangers; the most serious is the possibility of electrocution.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Among the chief hazards of electric-powered tools are burns and slight shocks which can lead to injuries or even heart failure. Under certain conditions, even a small amount of current can result in fibrillation of the heart and eventual death. A shock also can cause the user to fall off a ladder or other elevated work surface.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To protect the user from shock, tools must either have a three-wire cord with ground and be grounded, be double-insulated, or be powered by a low-voltage isolation transformer. Three-wire cords contain two current-carrying conductors and a grounding conductor. One end of the grounding conductor connects to the toolâs metal housing. The other end is grounded through a prong on the plug. Any time that an adapter is used to accommodate a two-hole receptacle, the adapter wire must be attached to a known ground. The third prong should never be removed from the plug.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Double insulation is more convenient. The user and the tools are protected in two ways: by normal insulation on the wires inside and by a housing that cannot conduct electricity to the operator in the event of a malfunction.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These general practices should be followed when using electric tools: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Electric tools should be operated within their design limitations. 
&lt;LI&gt;Gloves and safety footwear are recommended during use of electric tools. 
&lt;LI&gt;When not in use, tools should be stored in a dry place. 
&lt;LI&gt;Electric tools should not be used in damp or wet locations. 
&lt;LI&gt;Work areas should be well lit. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Powered abrasive wheel tools&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Powered abrasive grinding, cutting, polishing and wire buffing wheels create special safety problems because they may throw off flying fragments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Before an abrasive wheel is mounted, it should be inspected closely and sound- or ring-tested to be sure that it is free from cracks or defects. To test, wheels should be tapped gently with a light non-metallic instrument. If they sound cracked or dead, they could fly apart in operation and so must not be used. A sound and undamaged wheel will give a clear metallic tone or âring.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To prevent the wheel from cracking, the user should be sure it fits freely on the spindle. The spindle nut must be tightened enough to hold the wheel in place, without distorting the flange. Follow the manufacturerâs recommendations. Care must be taken to assure that the spindle wheel will not exceed the abrasive wheel specifications.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Due to the possibility of a wheel disintegrating (exploding) during start-up, the employee should never stand directly in front of the wheel as it accelerates to full operating speed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Portable grinding tools need to be equipped with safety guards to protect workers not only from the moving wheel surface, but also from flying fragments in case of breakage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition, when using a powered grinder: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Always use eye protection. 
&lt;LI&gt;Turn off the power when not in use. 
&lt;LI&gt;Never clamp a hand-held grinder in a vise. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Pneumatic tools&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pneumatic tools are powered by compressed air and include chippers, drills, hammers and sanders.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are several dangers encountered in the use of pneumatic tools. The main one is the danger of getting hit by one of the toolâs attachments or by some kind of fastener the worker is using with the tool.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Eye protection is required and face protection is recommended for employees working with pneumatic tools.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Noise is another hazard. Working with noisy tools such as jackhammers requires proper, effective use of hearing protection.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When using pneumatic tools, employees must check to see that they are fastened securely to the hose to prevent them from becoming disconnected. A short wire or positive locking device attaching the air hose to the tool will serve as an added safeguard.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A safety clip or retainer must be installed to prevent attachments, such as chisels on a chipping hammer, from being unintentionally shot from the barrel.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Screens must be set up to protect nearby workers from being struck by flying fragments around chippers, riveting guns, staplers, or air drills.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Compressed air guns should never be pointed toward anyone. Users should never âdead-endâ it against themselves or anyone else.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Powder-actuated tools&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Powder-actuated tools operate like a loaded gun and should be treated with the same respect and precautions. In fact, they are so dangerous that they must be operated only by specially trained employees.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Safety precautions to remember include the following: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;These tools should not be used in an explosive or flammable atmosphere. 
&lt;LI&gt;Before using the tool, the worker should inspect it to determine that it is clean, that all moving parts operate freely, and that the barrel is free from obstructions. 
&lt;LI&gt;The tool should never be pointed at anybody. 
&lt;LI&gt;The tool should not be loaded unless it is to be used immediately. A loaded tool should not be left unattended, especially where it would be available to unauthorized persons. 
&lt;LI&gt;Hands should be kept clear of the barrel end. To prevent the tool from firing accidentally, two separate motions are required for firing: one to bring the tool into position, and another to pull the trigger. The tools must not be able to operate until they are pressed against the work surface with a force of at least 5 pounds greater than the total weight of the tool. 
&lt;LI&gt;If a powder-actuated tool misfires, the employee should wait at least 30 seconds, then try firing it again. If it still will not fire, the user should wait another 30 seconds so that the faulty cartridge is less likely to explode, than carefully remove the load. The bad cartridge should be put in water. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Suitable eye and face protection are essential when using a powder-actuated tool.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The muzzle end of the tool must have a protective shield or guard centered perpendicularly on the barrel to confine any flying fragments or particles that might otherwise create a hazard when the tool is fired. The tool must be designed so that it will not fire unless it has this kind of safety device.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All powder-actuated tools must be designed for varying powder charges so that the user can select a powder level necessary to do the work without excessive force.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the tool develops a defect during use it should be tagged and taken out of service immediately until it is properly repaired.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Fasteners&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When using powder-actuated tools to apply fasteners, there are some precautions to consider. Fasteners must not be fired into material that would let them pass through to the other side. The fastener must not be driven into materials like brick or concrete any closer than 3 inches to an edge or corner. In steel, the fastener must not come any closer than one-half inch from a corner or edge. Fasteners must not be driven into very hard or brittle materials which might chip or splatter, or make the fastener ricochet.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An alignment guide must be used when shooting a fastener into an existing hole. A fastener must not be driven into a spalled area caused by an unsatisfactory fastening.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hydraulic power tools&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fluid used in hydraulic power tools must be an approved fire-resistant fluid and must retain its operating characteristics at the most extreme temperatures to which it will be exposed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The manufacturerâs recommended safe operating pressure for hoses, valves, pipes, filters and other fittings must not be exceeded.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Jacks&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;All jacks â lever and ratchet jacks, screw jacks and hydraulic jacks â must have a device that stops them from jacking up too high. Also, the manufacturerâs load limit must be permanently marked in a prominent place on the jack and should not be exceeded.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A jack should never be used to support a lifted load. Once the load has been lifted, it must immediately be blocked up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use wooden blocking under the base if necessary to make the jack level and secure. If the lift surface is metal, place a 1-inch-thick hardwood block or equivalent between it and the metal jack head to reduce the danger of slippage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To set up a jack, make certain of the following: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;the base rests on a firm level surface, 
&lt;LI&gt;the jack is correctly centered, 
&lt;LI&gt;the jack head bears against a level surface, and 
&lt;LI&gt;the lift force is applied evenly. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Proper maintenance of jacks is essential for safety. All jacks must be inspected before each use and lubricated regularly. If a jack is subjected to an abnormal load or shock, it should be thoroughly examined to make sure it has not been damaged.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hydraulic jacks exposed to freezing temperatures must be filled with an adequate antifreeze liquid.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;General safety precautions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Employees who use hand and power tools and who are exposed to the hazards of falling, flying, abrasive and splashing objects, or exposed to harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors or gases must be provided with the particular personal equipment necessary to protect them from the hazard.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All hazards involved in the use of power tools can be prevented by following five basic safety rules: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Keep all tools in good condition with regular maintenance. 
&lt;LI&gt;Use the right tool for the job. 
&lt;LI&gt;Examine each tool for damage before use. 
&lt;LI&gt;Operate according to the manufacturerâs instructions. 
&lt;LI&gt;Provide and use the proper protective equipment. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Employees and employers have a responsibility to work together to establish safe working procedures. If a hazardous situation is encountered, it should be brought to the attention of the proper individual immediately. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Taking control of your power tools</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing plants use a wide variety of power tools. From electric drills and impact wrenches to reciprocating saws and air chisels, power tools are utilized throughout the facility by maintenance and production workers. But, how are your power tools distributed to these plant-floor employees? How are your employees using a particular tool? How are they expected to access it? And, how does an employee find a tool when it isn&amp;rsquo;t where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200605_Applied-Reli---winware_cont.jpg" width="300" height="247"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;An electronic locker system can house power tools, hand &lt;br&gt;
tools and a myriad of other MRO (maintenance, repair and &lt;br&gt;
operations) products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Speeding up the process of distributing power tools on the shop floor 
  eliminates a great deal of downtime. Effectively tracking where the tool was used, who used the tool and what it was used on can take the guesswork out of the life and journeys of that power tool. Using a point-of-use distribution device that enables the employee to easily access needed tooling on the shop floor, and leaves him or her with the mind-set that they are accountable for its return, can overcome most of the difficulties associated with power tool distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="400" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200605_Applied-Reil---winware_gett.jpg" width="200" height="284"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting for power tools can be a pain, and replacing &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; ones can be expensive. Point-of-use electronic lockers make it easy to find and return these items.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;THE TYPICAL SCENARIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At some plants, tool crib personnel are responsible for issuing and receiving a tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the machine it will be used on is a half-mile away at the other end of the shop? The maintenance or production employee needing the tool must shut down the machine they are working on and walk to get that tool from the crib. Is that an effective use of time and a way to get the most production possible from that machine? And, what if that employee walks to the tool crib and the crib manager says, &amp;ldquo;Somebody must have gotten that on the afternoon shift yesterday and didn&amp;rsquo;t write it down.&amp;rdquo; The crib manager then starts walking to try and find the drill. All the while, the technician or operator still has the machine shut down. The crib manager finds out that Joe had the drill but gave it to Melissa on rolling mill No. 4 and she hasn&amp;rsquo;t brought it back. So, the crib manager walks again to find Melissa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This scenario is very common for facilities that don&amp;rsquo;t have an effective way of distributing power tools. A huge amount of time is wasted chasing them around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200605_Applied-Reli---winware_lock.jpg" width="200" height="133"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;LOCK THEM UP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Electronic lockers are an effective solution for securely storing, tracking and distributing power tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A number of companies that specialize in inventory management solutions have taken the &amp;ldquo;school-kid&amp;rdquo; locker concept to the industrial workplace, and a number of different types of systems are available. Some lockers are similar to those you 
  had in high school, but these attach to machines that vend keys to enable access. Other lockers are electronic and driven by software. These track every movement &lt;br&gt;
of the tools that they distribute on the shop floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Both types of systems allow point-of-use distribution, so a plant employee no longer encounters lengthy downtime because he or she has to walk a half-mile to the tool crib. Both types of lockers increase your ability to distribute tools on the shop floor. Software-driven lockers, though, have advantages over manual, key-type locker systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Software-driven models are ideal for not only distributing tools, but also for tracking usage and tool movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Electronic lockers allow you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; securely store your tools with easy access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; set security for product access control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; track tool usage by cost center&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; easily return the item to the locker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; automatically generate tool usage reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; eliminate theft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; give users a feeling of accountability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; reduce stockouts &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200605_Applied-Reli---winware_saw.jpg" width="200" height="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;REDUCE THEFT, 
  MISSING TOOLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Any manufacturing facility that uses power tools on a daily basis knows how costly it is to replace tools and how frustrating it is to hunt for tools. With electronic lockers, your operation immediately puts an end to missing tools and begins instilling a stronger sense of accountability among employees. Tools no longer float from machine to machine on the shop floor, or get deposited in lunch boxes when the shift is over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How can storing tools in lockers reduce theft and missing tools? Just storing them in lockers won&amp;rsquo;t. A software-controlled locker system is more than a storage unit. A good electronic locker system tracks a tool&amp;rsquo;s every movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For instance, if Joe takes a cordless drill from the locker at noon and another employee walks to the locker and finds the tool gone, he or she can easily access the software with a touch screen monitor to find out who currently has the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When employees know that everyone can see who used the tool last, their care for the tool increases. If something did happen to the tool, your employees are more inclined to report it at the time it happens. A responsible employee isn&amp;rsquo;t going to take a tool home or let someone else on the shop floor use the tool, knowing that the lockers have logged him or her as the person currently using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;SIMPLE AS 1-2-3 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use electronic lockers. Here are the steps that Joe would follow: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;  He walks to the electronic lockers and types his password on the touch screen, or scans his employee badge with a bar-code scanner. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The touch screen shows him the tools he can access. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; He selects the tool he needs and the locker door opens automatically. There are no keys to lose before he returns the tool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When Joe is finished using the tool, returning it is also easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;  He walks to the lockers and scans his badge or enters his password. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; He selects &amp;ldquo;return mode&amp;rdquo; and the touch screen shows him all of the tools for which he is currently accountable. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; He selects the tool he is returning. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The electronic locker door opens, he returns the tool and he is no longer accountable for it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Simple operation sets the electronic locker system apart from key-operated devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="subtitle2"&gt;QUESTIONS 
  AND ANSWERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  At the start of the article, you were asked, &amp;ldquo;How are your power tools distributed? How are plant employees using the tool? How are they expected to access it? And, how does an employee find a tool when it isn&amp;rsquo;t where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When answering those questions earlier, did your answers make sense? Did each answer include the word &amp;ldquo;effectively&amp;rdquo;? And, are you comfortable with the way your company is distributing power tools? If you answered &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to any of those questions, you and your plant need to rethink its current system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Electronic lockers could be the solution. System setup is nearly &amp;ldquo;plug and play,&amp;rdquo; and a good electronic locker system enables your organization to take total control of its power tools and stay in control of its budget. You&amp;rsquo;ll get to the next level of tool control without a great deal of time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
