            <title>Kentucky Gains Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kentucky manufacturing employment climbed for a fifth straight year, according to the 2016 Kentucky Manufacturers Register, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Kentucky gained 3,151 manufacturing jobs from October 2014 to October 2015, or 1.1 percent. The state is now home to 4,924 manufacturers employing 292,001 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Kentucky has reinvented itself as a hotbed for auto manufacturing following the recession&amp;#39;s steep losses,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;Its labor costs are among the lowest in the nation, and its favorable business environment continues to draw manufacturers to the state, with the transportation equipment industry growing by a third since 2010.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gains were led by the transportation equipment industry, which increased 7.4 percent over the year and has climbed steadily over the past several years. Transportation equipment ranks as the state&amp;#39;s largest sector by number of jobs, employing 49,863 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By comparison, employment in Tennessee&amp;#39;s transportation equipment industry grew 5.4 percent over the year and currently employs 51,001. Proportionately, Kentucky&amp;#39;s transportation equipment sector accounts for a larger percentage of overall industrial employment, accounting for 17 percent of the state&amp;#39;s factory jobs, compared to Tennessee&amp;#39;s 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kentucky&amp;#39;s transportation equipment sector is expected to keep growing as Ford expands hiring at its Louisville plant and GM adds jobs at its Bowling Green facility. Several Kentucky auto suppliers also announced openings over the year, including IWIS, which broke ground on a facility in Murray; American Howa Kentucky, which announced plans to open a plant in Midway; TWB, which will open a facility in Glasgow; and Grupo Antolin, which plans to establish two factories in Louisville, eventually employing 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Food processing, the state&amp;#39;s second largest industry by manufacturing employment, also added jobs, up 1.3 percent to 33,882, while third-ranked industrial machinery grew a half percent and now employs 28,838. Other Kentucky industries adding jobs over the year included lumber/wood, fabricated metals, stone/clay/glass, paper products and rubber/plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industries that lost jobs over the year included electronics, textiles/apparel, printing/publishing and chemicals. Industrial locations announcing closures included two Regal Beloit electric motor plants in Mount Sterling and Winchester, and frozen meal processor Gourmet Express in Greenville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	City data collected by MNI shows Louisville is Kentucky&amp;#39;s top city by manufacturing employment with 57,331 jobs. Second-ranked Lexington lost 3 percent of its industrial employment and now accounts for 18,050 jobs. Industrial jobs in Bowling Green fell 1 percent to 13,695.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bridgestone to Expand North Carolina Tire Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Bridgestone recently announced that it is expanding its passenger tire manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina, as part of a five-year, $164-million investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The multi-phase expansion of the 42-year-old facility, which is expected to break ground in early 2016, will improve the plant&amp;#39;s global competitive position by installing leading-edge technology, expanding production capacity and lowering costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phases one and two will focus on the addition of 167,000 square feet of manufacturing space to accommodate new tire assembly machines, material handling systems, curing presses and associated equipment to increase plant capacity by 3,000 tires per day. The new equipment also will allow the plant to respond to the increase in global demand for higher rim size tires as well as improve quality and productivity while reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our production and manufacturing capabilities must evolve with our products to meet the changing needs of today&amp;#39;s consumers,&amp;quot; said Michael Darr, plant manager. &amp;quot;Our investment in updated equipment and improved manufacturing processes and facilities reflects our focus on maintaining our global competitiveness as well as our commitment to the Wilson community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant currently manufactures 32,000 passenger tires a day. It was the first Bridgestone tire manufacturing facility to produce run-flat tires, and in 2016 will begin producing the company&amp;#39;s DriveGuard tires, the first full line of all-season replacement tires engineered to go up to 50 miles after a puncture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Wilson plant last underwent an expansion in 1999 when it added 85,000 square feet to the facility. The plant&amp;#39;s team has earned numerous safety awards, including marking the safest year in its 42 years of operations in 2012 and achieving certification earlier this year as a Rising Star facility from the North Carolina Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant also has received recognition for its environmental efforts, including three Green Factory Environmental Achievement Recognitions at Honda&amp;#39;s 22nd annual Environmental, Safety and Ergonomics Symposium in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, it was the first tire plant to earn ISO 50001 certification, reach Superior Energy Performance (SEP) Mature Pathway certification and achieve Underwriters Laboratories&amp;#39; (UL) landfill waste diversion claim validation for zero waste to landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda Sets Record for Auto Production in North America</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda recently reported that it set an all-time record for single-year North American automobile production in 2015, with total production of more than 1.8 million Honda and Acura vehicles, which was an increase of 3.1 percent over the previous record set in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda&amp;#39;s eight auto plants in North America produced more than 99 percent of the Honda and Acura cars and light trucks sold in the United States in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda also announced plans to fortify its light-truck supply capability by adding production of the Honda CR-V to the company&amp;#39;s Indiana plant and the new HR-V at a second plant in Mexico. Both moves are planned to take place in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are extremely proud of the record-setting efforts of our associates, which was key to our ability to meet record demand from our customers in North America for Honda and Acura vehicles,&amp;quot; said Takuji Yamada, president of Honda North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Continued flexibility has enabled Honda to add production of new models and move production between plants to optimize capacity and meet changing customer needs. In 2015, this included the startup of production of the Civic, HR-V and Pilot in North America, as well as the announcement of plans to dual-source the Acura MDX by adding production in Ohio in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We must make more efficient use of our existing capacity in North America,&amp;quot; said Takahiro Hachigo, president and CEO of Honda Motor Co. &amp;quot;We will work to advance a complementary supply system to meet the needs of customers in each local market and supplement the needs of customers in other regions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda operates 18 manufacturing facilities in North America, including eight automobile plants with the capacity to produce nearly 2 million Honda and Acura automobiles annually using domestic and globally sourced parts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hanon Systems to Launch New Manufacturing Plant in Ohio</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Hanon Systems recently announced plans to launch a new U.S. manufacturing facility in northwest Ohio to support its growing business with global vehicle manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The newly leased facility is located in the village of Carey in Wyandot County, which is approximately 70 miles from the Michigan border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are pleased to expand our presence in the U.S. to capitalize on business growth in this region, and we look forward to contributing to the local economy in Carey,&amp;quot; said In-Young Lee, president and chief executive officer of Hanon Systems. &amp;quot;As a true global supplier, Hanon Systems is well-positioned to support global vehicle platforms from virtually anywhere in the world, and this new facility will help deliver value-added capability at a strategic location that is close to our customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility includes approximately 95,000 square feet of manufacturing space, with room for expansion based on business needs. Initially, the facility will injection-mold and assemble heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modules on a range of future model-year vehicles for various global automakers. At full production, the company expects to employ nearly 140 hourly and salaried employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Ohio facility will be the first plant to launch under the Hanon Systems name, which changed from Halla Visteon Climate Control (HVCC) in July 2015. It also becomes the company&amp;#39;s 40th global manufacturing site and the first U.S. plant to open since 2003, when the company established an operation in Shorter, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production at the Ohio facility is expected to begin in mid-2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leading provider of automotive thermal solutions, Hanon Systems offers products such as heating ventilation and air conditioning, compressors, powertrain cooling, and fluid transport, as well as electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicle thermal systems. The company employs more than 15,500 people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Alloy Wheels are Manufactured</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Aluminum alloy wheels not only are more attractive than standard steel wheels, but they also are a fraction of the weight and therefore require less energy to rotate. This contributes to greater fuel efficiency as well as better handling, acceleration and braking. This 5-minute video shows the manufacturing process for aluminum alloy wheels, from casting and molding to heat treating, machining and painting.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GM to Add 500 Jobs at Michigan Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/7/ac48fafa-a2dc-494b-bd12-2aadfa0139a6_GenSixCamaro01.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;General Motors (GM) is adding a third shift and more than 500 hourly and salaried jobs at its assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan, to meet forecasted market demand for the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of a third shift will increase the plant&amp;#39;s workforce to approximately 2,300 when hiring is completed. Third shift hiring is currently underway at the plant. The shift is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is the result of the award-winning vehicles Lansing Grand River produces and the confidence GM has in our team to build world-class quality for our customers,&amp;quot; said Mike Trevorrow, Lansing regional plant manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Built in 2001, Lansing Grand River (LGR) is GM&amp;#39;s second-newest U.S. assembly plant. It manufactures the Camaro, the Cadillac ATS and CTS as well as their V-series performance versions on a single production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is an exciting time at LGR,&amp;quot; said Mike Green, United Automobile Workers (UAW) local 652 president. &amp;quot;We just added the Chevrolet Camaro to our vehicle lineup, and now we get to expand the UAW-GM family, which will bring the plant to full capacity. What a great way to start the New Year!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

	The company will establish operations in the 85,000-square-foot facility formerly occupied by Twin Creeks Technologies. The project will create 200 new jobs by its third year of operation, with another 100 expected to be added by the fifth year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are pleased to locate this manufacturing operation here in Senatobia,&amp;quot; said ABB&amp;#39;s Chuck Treadway. &amp;quot;We made our decision after an extensive search. We found that Tate County offered an excellent combination of skilled workers, quality of life and a positive business environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, ABB is a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility, industry, transport and infrastructure customers to improve performance while lowering their environmental impact. The company operates in approximately 100 countries and employs nearly 140,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I thank the ABB team for its commitment to creating 300 new job opportunities for Senatobia&amp;#39;s workforce,&amp;quot; said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. &amp;quot;ABB&amp;#39;s decision to locate in Mississippi demonstrates to the world that we have the competitive advantages needed for success in today&amp;#39;s fast-paced economy. I wish the company many successful years in north Mississippi.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Winnebago to Open Oregon Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Winnebago Industries recently announced plans to open a manufacturing plant in Junction City, Oregon. The company intends to use the former Country Coach facility for the production of select diesel Winnebago products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This purchase is part of Winnebago&amp;#39;s ongoing strategy to further solidify the company as a leader in the RV industry for years to come,&amp;quot; said Scott Degnan, Winnebago&amp;#39;s vice president of sales and product management. &amp;quot;As part of the facility purchase, Winnebago also acquired the intellectual property rights associated with Country Coach, and we intend to revive that brand as part of the planned use of the new facility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant is expected to employ approximately 200 people and begin operating in the second half of 2016. Winnebago estimates a total investment between $15 and $20 million, including land, buildings, modifications, production equipment and technology infrastructure. Lane County commissioners approved the use of up to $100,000 in lottery funds to assist with the cost of infrastructure improvements necessary to open the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Winnebago is helping to breathe life into an industry that was largely lost during the Great Recession,&amp;quot; said Lane County commissioner Jay Bozievich. &amp;quot;Lane County has many skilled and talented workers in need of living-wage manufacturing jobs to sustain themselves and their families.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Yokohama Opens Mississippi Tire Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Yokohama Tire Manufacturing Mississippi (YTMM) recently announced the opening of a new $300-million commercial truck tire facility in West Point, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The grand opening of our first U.S.-built plant is truly a historic day for Yokohama,&amp;quot; said Tadaharu Yamamoto, president of YTMM. &amp;quot;Thanks to Gov. Bryant, the great state of Mississippi, the entire community of West Point, the Golden Triangle Region and the incredible Mississippi workforce, the plant site was developed to a fully operational state-of-the-art facility in record time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just a little more than 24 months after breaking ground on the site, YTMM has hired more than 260 employees and plans to eventually reach 500. The 1-million-square-foot facility was constructed on more than 500 acres of land and houses manufacturing, warehousing and operations facilities. It will produce up to 1 million tires annually when running at full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The opening of Yokohama&amp;#39;s manufacturing facility in West Point brings full circle a project that broke ground just two short years ago,&amp;quot; said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. &amp;quot;I congratulate Yokohama on this milestone event, and the state of Mississippi looks forward to many more years of partnership with this great company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE Aviation to Construct Two New Alabama Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE Aviation recently announced that the company will be investing more than $200 million to create two new adjacent factories in Huntsville, Alabama. The plants will produce silicon carbide (SiC) materials used to manufacture ceramic matrix composite components (CMCs) for jet engines and land-based gas turbines. When the factories become operational, they are expected to employ up to 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Establishing the new GE factories in Alabama is a very significant step in developing the supply chain we need in order to produce CMC components in large volume,&amp;quot; said GE Aviation vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One plant will produce silicon carbide ceramic fiber. It will be the first such operation in the United States. Currently, the only large-scale SiC ceramic fiber factory in the world is operated by NGS Advanced Fibers in Japan, which is a joint company of Nippon Carbon, GE and Safran of France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The adjacent GE factory will use the SiC ceramic fiber to produce the unidirectional CMC tape necessary to fabricate CMC components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Construction of the two plants will begin in 2016, with production projected to start in 2018. GE has already begun hiring the technical team that will transfer to the Huntsville operation. GE expects to hire the hourly workforce in late 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Proposes $900-million Investment in Chicago Assembly Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. has proposed a $900-million investment in its Chicago assembly plant under a tentative labor contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW). The investment would create approximately 200 new jobs at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the proposed agreement, the Chicago assembly plant will receive a $900-million investment to support production of the new Explorer and Police Interceptor, continued production of the Taurus, and a new vehicle that will be announced at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production of the new vehicle would create approximately 200 jobs at the plant in addition to the existing 4,400 employees. The agreement also includes employee incentives that would create a near-term infusion of more than $54 million into the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ford&amp;#39;s investment in Chicago under this agreement will create high-paying jobs and ensure the Torrence Avenue plant continues to grow for years to come,&amp;quot; said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. &amp;quot;Ford knows that Chicago&amp;#39;s workforce, transportation systems and quality of life are second to none, and this contract is a win for both Ford&amp;#39;s workers and the south side of Chicago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four-year agreement has been approved by Ford and UAW leadership, and now goes to workers for ratification.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Denso Manufacturing Tennessee recently announced that it will invest $400 million to expand its automotive components and systems manufacturing plant in Maryville, making it one of the largest operating campuses in the company&amp;#39;s worldwide operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion will create 500 new jobs and significantly increase Denso&amp;#39;s manufacturing capabilities. Due to expanded production needs at two of the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing plants, the existing warehouse will be converted to manufacturing space, and a new consolidated warehouse will be built on the company&amp;#39;s current campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Thanks to our skilled associates and their dedication to manufacturing the highest quality automotive technology, Denso remains committed to investing in this region and creating jobs,&amp;quot; said Denso Manufacturing Tennessee president Jack Helmboldt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key supplier of advanced technology to the automotive industry, Denso Manufacturing Tennessee produces starters, alternators, instrument clusters and a wide range of electronic components and systems. The Maryville campus consists of four manufacturing plants on 194 acres and has a workforce of more than 3,100 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We want to congratulate Denso on its latest expansion and the 500 new jobs they will create in Maryville and Blount County,&amp;quot; said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. &amp;quot;Today&amp;#39;s announcement is another indication of the momentum Tennessee has in the automotive manufacturing sector.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Missouri Manufacturing Job Growth Stalls</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment growth in Missouri stalled over the past year, according to the 2016 Missouri Manufacturers Register, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. (MNI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Missouri shed 1,397 industrial jobs from August 2014 to August 2015, its first loss since the 2010-2011 survey period. The state is now home to 7,559 manufacturers employing 362,014 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Like many states, Missouri is struggling with depressed global markets and a stronger dollar, which is putting a dent in manufacturing employment growth,&amp;rdquo; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;ldquo;However, the state&amp;rsquo;s solid infrastructure and business-friendly environment is helping many industries thrive in the state, especially the transportation equipment sector, which continues to see healthy post-recession growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in transportation equipment increased 7.6 percent between August 2010 and August 2015, recovering 27 percent of the 11,879 jobs lost during the recession. Transportation equipment currently ranks as the state&amp;rsquo;s top sector by number of jobs, employing 45,145.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the industry included Ford&amp;rsquo;s expanded hiring at its Kansas City assembly plant, the opening of Faurecia&amp;rsquo;s seating plant in Wentzville, and the establishment of Boeing&amp;rsquo;s new assembly plant in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Food processing, the state&amp;rsquo;s top sector by number of jobs, also helped to offset losses. Other industries posting gains over the year included instruments/related products, textiles/apparel and lumber/wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Losses were reported in printing/publishing, stone/clay/glass, fabricated metals, industrial machinery and chemical processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial jobs in St. Louis remained steady over the year, with the city home to the most manufacturing jobs in the state at 80,211. Kansas City posted a one-half percent loss but still ranked second with 44,958 jobs, while employment was unchanged in third-ranked Springfield, which currently accounts for 16,459 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GM Assembly Plant to Add 1,200 Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/22/50c748a7-b91e-46f6-b33b-379feb67b82a_GM-Detroit-Hamtramck-Assembly-Main.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 246px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;General Motors (GM) recently announced that it will be nearly doubling its workforce at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant by adding a second shift and more than 1,200 hourly and salaried jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of a second shift will increase the plant&amp;#39;s workforce to approximately 2,800 people when hiring is completed. The second shift is necessary to meet forecasted market demand for the five cars produced at Detroit-Hamtramck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is the result of the award-winning vehicles Detroit-Hamtramck produces and the confidence GM has in our team to build world-class quality for our customers,&amp;quot; said plant manager Gary West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second shift hiring is already underway. The shift is scheduled to begin operations in early 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The workforce at Detroit-Hamtramck is second to none,&amp;quot; said Don LaForest, local shop chairman. &amp;quot;We appreciate the opportunity to expand our UAW-GM family.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last six years, GM has invested $1 billion in the 4.1-million-square-foot Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant, which opened in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant currently builds the Chevrolet Volt, Impala and Malibu as well as the Cadillac ELR on a single production line. The plant will begin production on the Cadillac CT6 in early 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/20/1514d4a1-52ce-497e-8872-2e20d39ea3ae_toyota-lexxus.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Toyota&amp;#39;s manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, recently began production on the Lexus ES 350, bringing the popular sedan to the American assembly line for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company invested $360 million toward a dedicated assembly line, adding 750 new jobs. Total capacity for the new line will be 50,000 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Localizing Lexus production is in line with our North American production strategy and is rooted in our philosophy of building cars where we sell them,&amp;quot; said Toyota North America CEO Jim Lentz. &amp;quot;The Kentucky plant is known for being one of the top vehicle manufacturing facilities in the world. With our talented team in Georgetown building our popular ES 350, we&amp;#39;re positioned to better serve our U.S. customers now and well into the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prepare to build the Lexus sedan, team members underwent 1.5 million hours of training, including trips to Japan to learn the art of Lexus craftsmanship. It also meant spending time behind the wheel of an ES, driving it on Kentucky roads and visiting dealerships to gain an understanding of customer expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Before we were chosen to build the ES, we put a plan in place to show we were capable of building Lexus before Lexus would consider coming here,&amp;quot; said Wil James, president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky Inc. &amp;quot;That strengthened us across our plant, and as a result, we&amp;#39;re building better cars overall.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the addition of the Lexus units, the Kentucky plant will have capacity to build more than 550,000 vehicles a year. Total employment now stands at more than 7,500.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ArcelorMittal Wins Sustainability Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ArcelorMittal was recently recognized for its sustainability leadership with a World Steel Association Steelie award. The company was honored with the Excellence in Sustainability award for its 10 Sustainable Development Outcomes, a key foundation for its new sustainability framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The award focuses on one specific sustainability initiative or program that has made a positive impact or provided benefits in all three areas of sustainability, including economic, environmental and social performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ArcelorMittal faced competition from China Steel Corp. for its development of an industrial park using byproduct fuel gases and Tata Steel Europe for the certification of 19 construction products for responsible sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ArcelorMittal&amp;#39;s nomination most closely met the judging criteria, which included demonstrating to what extent the initiative impacted or provided benefits for the company and/or society in the three sustainability areas. Judges also assessed how widely the initiative was communicated to stakeholders and what level of community/stakeholder outreach related to the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ArcelorMittal has been shortlisted each year since the award began in 2010 but only once before has been awarded the Steelie for excellence in sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;ArcelorMittal&amp;#39;s 10 Sustainable Development Outcomes were launched this year to provide a fresh approach to identifying the contribution the company &amp;ndash; and wider steel industry &amp;ndash; can make to a sustainable future in which steel plays a valuable contribution,&amp;quot; said Alan Knight, ArcelorMittal&amp;#39;s general manager of corporate responsibility. &amp;quot;The outcomes are supported by a sustainable development framework that describes the management steps the company will take to get there. We believe that through this framework, we will raise the profile of steel and catalyze stakeholder interest in the contribution it has to make to a sustainable future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now in their sixth year, the World Steel Association&amp;#39;s Steelie awards recognize member companies or individuals for their contribution to the steel industry over the past year in a series of categories impacting the steel industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Rolls-Royce to Upgrade Indiana Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/6/9c00241b-b08f-4061-a941-402bfdb7c0bf_pr-10-05-2015-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 207px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Rolls-Royce recently announced that it will invest nearly $600 million to modernize its manufacturing operations in Indianapolis and conduct technology research. The modernization plan will enable the company to become more competitive by replacing outdated facilities and accelerating the introduction of new and advanced manufacturing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Renovation of the existing buildings will begin immediately. Upgrades will include new manufacturing and assembly operations that will match the advanced standards already present in many other Rolls-Royce facilities in Indiana and around the world. The five-year modernization plan will also consolidate operations and significantly reduce utility costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our new facility will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing center that combines modern production systems and machinery with a highly skilled workforce,&amp;quot; said Marion Blakey, president and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America. &amp;quot;This investment ensures that we can increase our competitiveness in the market, which will benefit both our customers and Rolls-Royce.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the agreement to make the investment, Rolls-Royce will receive approximately $35 million in state and city incentives, including conditional tax credits and a skills-enhancement grant through the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. Rolls-Royce and the city of Indianapolis have also agreed in principle to amend Rolls-Royce&amp;#39;s existing property tax abatement agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Plant Builds 4 Millionth Engine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/17/830e6a94-f5ba-48f7-98d1-6e878b01fba1_2015_TMMAL_4_million-for-web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 329px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The Toyota motor manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Alabama, recently celebrated the production of its 4 millionth engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the plant makes V6 and V8 engines as well, the 4 millionth engine was produced on the 4-cylinder line. Since the start of production in 2003, the Huntsville plant has built 1 million 4-cylinder engines, 1.3 million V6 engines and 1.7 million V8 engines. The engines go into seven Toyota vehicles built in North America: Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Sequoia, Tacoma, Tundra and Venza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a testament to our team members,&amp;quot; said Jim Bolte, president of Toyota Alabama. &amp;quot;They are dedicated to building high-quality engines, and whether it was the first in 2003 or the 4 millionth, the same amount of detail and craftsmanship goes into each one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Huntsville plant, which employs approximately 1,300, has distinguished itself in the Toyota family &amp;ndash; not just in the United States, but worldwide. For example, it is the only Toyota plant globally to produce the 4-cylinder, V6 and V8 engine under one roof, making it among the largest Toyota engine plants globally. It is also one of only two designated &amp;quot;model sustainable plants&amp;quot; in North America, which results in other Toyota facilities benchmarking for its environmental achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We look to the Alabama plant as a leader,&amp;quot; said Osamu Ushio, executive vice president of operations and manufacturing for Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America Inc. &amp;quot;Every challenge it has faced, the team there exceeds any and all expectations. That is why we continue to invest so much into the facility. They have what it takes to be successful &amp;ndash; a strong group of team members who are dedicated to quality and safety. They should be very proud of the 4-millionth milestone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the last 10 years, the plant has taken on five major investments and four expansions. Most recently, a project costing $230 million was completed that involved a boost to V6 production. That brings the total plant investment to $864 million since the 2001 groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe we hit 4 million,&amp;quot; said Tina Lane, Toyota Alabama team member who has been building engines on the line since the plant opened. &amp;quot;There is a lot of pride that goes along with it. Just think, 4 million Toyota vehicles around the world are being powered by our engines; that&amp;rsquo;s a big responsibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford, Alcoa to Collaborate on Lightweight Automotive Parts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. and Alcoa Inc. recently entered into a joint development agreement to collaborate on next-generation aluminum alloys for automotive parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford will begin using Alcoa&amp;#39;s Micromill material in 2016 F-150 production in the fourth quarter of 2015 and plans to increase its use over the next several years on a range of vehicle components and future platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alcoa&amp;#39;s Micromill technology, which was introduced in late 2014, produces an aluminum alloy that is 40 percent more formable than today&amp;#39;s automotive aluminum. By using the highly formable material, parts constructed of multiple pieces can be manufactured as a single part, reducing complexity and assembly time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Target applications for the material include critical-strength structural parts as well as exterior panels that must meet strict surface quality requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This collaboration supports our continued drive for innovation as we research automotive applications for even greater light-weighting,&amp;quot; said Raj Nair, Ford group vice president and chief technical officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The joint development agreement between Alcoa and Ford will further expand the existing suite of automotive alloys produced by Micromill technology for use on Ford vehicles. New alloys will improve design flexibility on lightweight parts and provide better vehicle performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Owens Corning to Invest $90 Million in New Missouri Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Owens Corning recently announced plans to open a new manufacturing facility in Joplin, Missouri. The plant will manufacture Thermafiber mineral wool insulation for commercial, residential and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company will move into a 303,000-square-foot facility and invest nearly $90 million to purchase and install equipment at the site. Owens Corning expects the plant to be fully operational in 2016. The project is expected to create more than 100 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our new location puts us close to attractive markets and accessible raw materials, a decision we believe will result in higher productivity and an increase in efficiency,&amp;quot; said Julian Francis, president of Owens Corning Insulation. &amp;quot;As demand for mineral wool increases, we will need many hands on deck to fulfill orders, and we are eager to tap into the state&amp;#39;s talent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How the Industrial Internet Can Improve Machine Health</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/9/92d8ffdd-8806-4262-9293-af2dcd6efe4b_machine-health.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 370px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Today, the demands on manufacturers are driving an unprecedented rate of change, innovation and agility. Organizations must seek new ways to unleash the power of data that has traditionally been locked up in silos. Many manufacturers are turning to the industrial Internet to transform their operations through the use of data and analytics, but their ability to access data in a consistent and meaningful way has been a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By leveraging the industrial Internet, manufacturers can use the real-time production data they collect, analyze it, gather insight and make adjustments to increase uptime and efficiency in operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Get Connected&amp;nbsp;to Critical Data and Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consistent and accurate data collection is the most critical first step of improving overall performance. You cannot monitor what you cannot measure, and you cannot compare and improve if you do not get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For manufacturers, the initial phase is to connect their assets and begin creating the digital thread they need to pull data throughout their organization. For example, a manufacturer can start monitoring the operational issues that affect production efficiency. This digital thread will show them how many products they actually produced versus how many products they should be producing in order to meet customer demand. Just as important is a simple and consistent way of viewing the data. The data must be organized in a manner that is simple and straightforward to understand and visualize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Get Insights to Make Intelligent Decisions and Take Positive Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With high-level connectivity and visibility, you can then analyze and interpret the data by drilling down to see trends or patterns of incremental improvement or identify issues that might not be noticeable in isolation but are magnified in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not about gathering data that optimizes one particular machine, but rather the connectivity of the manufacturing process to gather insights across a production line or plant. This enables plant leaders to correlate disparate types of data and use out-of-the-box technology solutions to display and report on that relevant data in real time. Then, manufacturers can make the right decisions to increase throughput, minimize waste or reduce disruption in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Get Optimized to&amp;nbsp;Achieve Operational Excellence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, it&amp;rsquo;s time to utilize the insight gained from the data to achieve the best possible results. This includes uncovering areas for improvement and prioritizing and mapping those to larger goals or key initiatives. Optimization is realized when you can perform most efficiently and effectively using minimal resources and ensuring more reliability and predictability in meeting goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the cloud, manufacturing intelligence systems and software as a service (SaaS) come in to analyze the data in order to make decisions and improvements so operations can be more efficient. For example, a plant leader may notice that employees are working a lot of overtime and discover the problem is not that the people are slow or inefficient workers but that the machines or materials they need to do their jobs are not available when they need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Empowerment is Key to Machine Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fitbits have gained in popularity because they enable consumers to easily monitor, measure and compare personalized health information. They empower users to take control of their health. Similarly, the industrial Internet is enabling plant leaders that same opportunity to gain intelligence, connectivity and empowerment to achieve manufacturing excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/BSAco14N8aw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Daimler, Nissan to Open Joint Plant in Mexico</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/8/9a0ecf77-9fdf-4638-959c-f2f1768bc18f_nissan_alliance_infiniti.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 274px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance recently broke ground on a new joint-venture manufacturing complex in central Mexico, which will build premium compact vehicles for the Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The partners will invest a total of $1 billion in the joint venture and oversee the construction and operation of the state-of-the-art manufacturing plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Today marks an important milestone for the partnership between Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance,&amp;quot; said Markus Sch&amp;auml;fer of Mercedes-Benz. &amp;quot;This new joint plant will help both partners to serve their respective customers faster and with more flexibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Located near the Nissan Aguascalientes A2 plant, COMPAS (Cooperation Manufacturing Plant Aguascalientes) will have an initial annual production capacity of more than 230,000 vehicles and will create about 3,600 direct jobs by 2020. The plant is also expected to generate some 12,000 indirect jobs. Depending on the market development and customer demand, there will be the potential to add additional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This new plant represents yet another example of the growing collaboration between the Renault-Nissan Alliance and Daimler,&amp;quot; said Jose Mu&amp;ntilde;oz, executive vice president at Nissan Motor Co. &amp;quot;Mexico is a global benchmark for quality and efficiency, and is a major reason why Daimler and Nissan have decided to produce the next generations of premium compact cars for Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti here in Aguascalientes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production of Infiniti vehicles will begin in 2017, while the first Mercedes-Benz vehicles will roll off the line in 2018. Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance will closely collaborate at every stage of the product creation process. Brand identity will be safeguarded as the Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti vehicles will clearly differ from each other in terms of product design, driving characteristics and specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Daimler and the Renault-Nissan Alliance will also produce premium compact cars at other production locations around the world, including Europe and China.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Capitalize on Connectivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/8/12/c6a38137-77e0-4b8f-a5e1-cb3f85ca8eb7_web-exclusive.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Industrial manufacturing is in the midst of a disruptive shift, with a landscape that is markedly different from even a decade ago. Today&amp;rsquo;s machines are increasingly brainy and interactive. Sensor technologies, automated controls and advanced design software are becoming intrinsic to manufacturing. These developments are transforming the way businesses operate, resulting in profound gains in performance and productivity. At the same time, these opportunities bring new risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;For hundreds of years, humans and machines have worked together, but something peculiar has happened recently: the machines are now speaking to us &amp;mdash; and to one another,&amp;rdquo; says Sedar LaBarre, Booz Allen vice president. &amp;ldquo;While the potential is enormous, the associated challenges could result in manufacturers missing a prime opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s Internet of Things environment, manufacturers need a new breed of engineering expertise, the ability to constantly operate in startup mode, actionable insights into the supplier environment and digitally focused business models to capitalize on newfound customer intelligence. By understanding their full ecosystem, manufacturers can gain the confidence to move forward and capture opportunities to innovate, differentiate and leverage existing assets in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are five priorities for industrial manufacturers to consider in 2015 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Harvest and Integrate Production Data to Optimize Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everyone recognizes the power of data. Many companies have started to implement sensors across their production environment, collecting reams of new data with the potential to markedly improve throughput and reliability for factory operations. Berg Insight recently reported that the number of connected devices in industrial automation reached 10.3 million in 2014, with that number expected to grow to 43.5 million by 2020. Yet many organizations are still struggling to reap efficiencies and insights from this data because they haven&amp;rsquo;t created the proper technical and decision-making structures to organize and analyze data for real business value. The old model of collecting data and waiting for it to provide an answer is insufficient. What&amp;rsquo;s required now is a focused and pragmatic approach to harvesting and integrating data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers must sort through the noise to find the value hidden within signals and patterns that tell stories of what&amp;rsquo;s happening or will happen with production equipment. The best organizations are using technology to connect their machinery &amp;mdash; grabbing data and turning that into insights to drive decisions around business optimization. Forward-thinking industrial manufacturers are embracing this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, smart tractors today can fight fungus and adjust soil acidity to increase crop yields and save farmers money, while smart cities can leverage digital inputs from citizens to improve traffic and pedestrian flow, thereby reducing congestion and saving valuable resources. Not only are today&amp;rsquo;s best connected products easily integrated into local architectures, but these architectures can now evolve in real time as they analyze new data. The future lies in leveraging this information to optimize internal processes and drive toward higher margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Use Real-Time Analysis to Improve the Customer Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Large manufacturers have traditionally faced challenges in collecting reliable data to understand and adjust to the needs of end users. While surveys have been common in the industry, the data that was collected was expensive, difficult to acquire and frequently unreliable. What&amp;rsquo;s more, the time required to collect such information made it unlikely that a company could incorporate any lessons learned into its current production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s data analytics capabilities represent a new frontier for customer satisfaction. The ability to collect and analyze customer usage data in real-time allows manufacturers to make quick adjustments that improve their products and the customer experience. For instance, remotely collecting usage data on farms from deployed windmills can reveal shifting wind conditions and immediately allow a remote operator to optimize the degree of effort that specific windmills are exerting within those farms. These metrics allow companies to not only fix current products but also add new features to products that customers want &amp;mdash; even if they haven&amp;rsquo;t said so. Companies that understand this paradigm invest in the capabilities to enable data capture and analysis, and work with customers to ensure its value will thrive in this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Design a Dynamic Cyber Program to Match Your Connected Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing industry is transforming with innovations in speed, autonomy, quality and customization. Leaders increasingly rely on embedded technologies, connectivity and automation to make smarter factories a reality and provide more intelligence and precision than ever before. In addition, information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments are more intertwined, as connections are made to meet business needs. These connected capabilities present profound revenue potential, but they also require a new level of trust with your customer. A strong cybersecurity program protects that trusted relationship, enabling the promise of the connected product. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about compliance; it&amp;rsquo;s about realizing business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In short, don&amp;rsquo;t simply defer to the cyber experts. Successfully managing cyber risks in today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly connected industrial environment cannot be achieved by adopting traditional IT approaches alone. Your cybersecurity approach should be custom-fit to your unique requirements. It requires a combination of industrial and technological know-how, plus a collaborative, multi-disciplinary mindset to protect both the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; physical and data assets. Industrial manufacturers must develop a cybersecurity strategy to holistically address the people, processes and technologies that are unique to your business and in a way that is agile enough to respond to the shifting landscape in which you operate. In the end, your customers are buying your product, your brand experience &amp;ndash; not your approach to cybersecurity. A strong cybersecurity program working in the background keeps the focus where it most benefits your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Work Directly with Suppliers to Reduce Cyber Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supply chain functions have traditionally been seen as internal operations, but that&amp;rsquo;s starting to change in today&amp;rsquo;s connected society. As we&amp;rsquo;ve seen in several major breaches, such as those in the retail industry, supply chains represent a significant cyber threat, with potentially damaging business impacts. Today&amp;rsquo;s suppliers are interconnected digitally with the companies they supply, with a network of software and hardware components that are sourced from a broad global market. If your supplier networks become infected, you become infected and possibly your end customers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without high-confidence visibility into your supplier tiers and security levels, it is difficult &amp;mdash; if not impossible &amp;mdash; to understand whether inbound materials or systems have been compromised. While addressing supply chain cybersecurity should include a risk and maturity assessment, it ultimately begins with understanding your supplier network. By building relationships with your suppliers, you can work together to track key risk factors such as ownership, manufacturing locations, supplier relationships and the available attack surface. You can begin to implement continuous monitoring throughout the product life cycle, perform deep multi-dimensional analytics with open source tools and eventually expand your scope of vetting to include subcontractors. Ultimately, these new processes help protect your end users and set up your business for long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Close the Skills Gap to Compete with High Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As manufacturing evolves and business models become more connected, this creates the need for a new breed of talent &amp;mdash; one that embraces computer science as much as mechanical engineering. The next generation of manufacturing talent must enable digital factories to flourish, protect supply chains from cyber intrusions and bring high-end embedded analytics to products deployed in customer environments. But manufacturers face strong competition from high-tech companies in recruiting this talent, posing a significant risk to the future of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To compete today and in the future, industrial manufacturers need a talent management strategy to recruit, develop and retain the workforce of tomorrow. Leaders must transform the manufacturing brand to be more attractive to the new generation of talent, build a culture of innovation to celebrate forward thinking and foster employee engagement to create an environment that allows individuals to thrive. Industrial players who think boldly and take action now will outpace their competitors &amp;mdash; both traditional and emerging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One prominent trend is how certain automakers are establishing dedicated points of presence in Silicon Valley, with a focus on re-branding legacy images and also getting involved in venture financing of emerging technologies that may shape the future driving experience. With so much convergence and disruption, manufacturers need to grasp this opportunity to re-cast legacy images and make their environments appealing to coveted high-tech talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/qt4_uMDmmC0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota to Expand Indiana Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM) recently announced a new $16-million expansion and building renovation at its forklift manufacturing plant in Columbus, Indiana. The 50,600-square-foot addition will increase the total facility to 1.1 million square feet of manufacturing and support space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota plans to expand its new product development capability in the United States to improve support for the North American market. The new building and renovation will support the company&amp;#39;s strategic initiatives along with human development activities, new manufacturing technology development and product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion includes a two-story office building, cafeteria, storm shelter, locker room and expansion space for Toyota&amp;#39;s onsite medical center for associates and their families. The new building will also serve as headquarters for Toyota Material Handling North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;To achieve our long-term vision and goals, we are investing in our people and our manufacturing and support space,&amp;quot; said Tony Miller, senior vice president at TIEM. &amp;quot;This expansion represents Toyota&amp;#39;s commitment to its associates, customers and the Columbus, Indiana, community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past 25 years, Toyota associates have built more than 500,000 forklifts, with the majority of all Toyota forklifts sold in North America produced at TIEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company will hold a ground-breaking ceremony in September 2015 and a grand-opening ceremony when construction is complete in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Caterpillar to Bring Vocational Truck Production to Texas Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar recently announced that it will begin independently designing and manufacturing its vocational truck product family at its plant in Victoria, Texas. The facility, which opened in 2012, currently produces hydraulic excavators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar launched its first vocational truck, the CT660, in the North American market in 2011. Two more models, the CT680 and CT681, have since been added to the lineup. To date, Caterpillar has worked with Navistar on the design and build of the products, which are currently manufactured in Escobedo, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We appreciate the collaboration we have had with Navistar,&amp;quot; said Chris Chadwick, Caterpillar&amp;#39;s director of the Global On-Highway Truck Group. &amp;quot;As we look to future launches of new truck models, this updated strategy will better position us to help provide our customers with the best products and services for this market.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transition process will begin immediately, with production projected to start in the first half of 2016. The addition of the vocational truck production is expected to add around 200 new jobs at the facility, which will continue to produce excavators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Caterpillar Victoria is proud to be a part of this opportunity,&amp;quot; added Ed O&amp;#39;Neil, general manager for operations in the Excavation Division. &amp;quot;The Victoria facility was selected because of our team&amp;#39;s proven record of building high-quality Cat products, our commitment to safety and our successful implementation of the Caterpillar production system and lean manufacturing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Report Recommends Strategies for Closing Manufacturing's Gender Gap</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent report by the Manufacturing Institute, Deloitte and the APICS Supply Chain Council calls on manufacturers to focus efforts on gender diversity to mitigate the skills gap and improve the U.S. manufacturing sector&amp;rsquo;s ability to compete worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The joint study, which represents both the collective perspective of 600 women in manufacturing as well as the voice of manufacturing leaders, confirms the importance of increasing the amount of women in the manufacturing workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the study, 65 percent of survey respondents indicate their company does not have an active recruitment program to attract potential female employees, and nearly three-quarters of respondents believe women are underrepresented within organizations&amp;rsquo; leadership teams. Many women also claim that performance standards are not equal for men and women, with 77 percent maintaining the standards are higher for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the challenges uncovered in the study, it is clear women in manufacturing have a positive outlook, as slightly more than half of respondents indicate they have observed positive change in manufacturing&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward female professional employees over the last five years. Furthermore, two-thirds of women responding to the survey said they would endorse a career in manufacturing for their daughters or family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our research estimates that the cumulative manufacturing skills gap &amp;mdash; or the positions that likely won&amp;rsquo;t be filled due to a lack of skilled workers &amp;mdash; will grow to 2 million between 2015 and 2025,&amp;quot; said Craig Giffi, Deloitte vice chairman. &amp;quot;The industry is missing out on a critical talent resource to advance innovation in manufacturing, increase America&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness in the global manufacturing landscape and close that skills gap.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Women constitute manufacturing&amp;rsquo;s largest pool of untapped talent in the United States, comprising just more than one-fourth of manufacturing employees even though they make up nearly half of the total U.S. labor force. Women are underrepresented in nearly every U.S. manufacturing sector and are seldom seen in the top-level boxes on organizational charts, lagging behind the proportion of women in leadership roles at other types of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Recruiting and retaining women in manufacturing is just smart business,&amp;quot; noted Antoinette (Tonie) Leatherberry, co-author of the research and principal for Deloitte Consulting. &amp;quot;Organizations that make recruitment, retention and advancement of women a strategic priority stand to gain greater access to this impressive talent pool, which in turn will give their company a competitive advantage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Dhiyo House to Establish Virginia Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dhiyo House recently announced that it will invest $6.1 million to establish its first manufacturing operation in Virginia. The specialty supplier of belting for the conveyor and power transmission industries will build a 40,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in the Wise County Industrial Park to produce belting and expand production with additional products. The project is expected to create 80 new jobs in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Dhiyo House chose Virginia because it is the most suitable location for our business, and the Wise County coal industry gave us tremendous love and support,&amp;quot; said Deepa Luthra, owner of Dhiyo House. &amp;quot;Southwest Virginia is coal country and provides close proximity to all neighboring coal states, including but not limited to Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dhiyo House has provided a variety of conveyor and power transmission belts since 2005. The company serves rock quarries, hard rock and soft mineral mines, sugar mills, cement works, foundries, brick workers, smelters, paper and saw mills, power plants, and many other types of industrial and mining operations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) worked with Wise County, the Wise County Industrial Development Authority and the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority to secure the project for Virginia. Gov. Terry McAuliffe approved a $250,000 grant from the Commonwealth&amp;rsquo;s Opportunity Fund to assist Wise County with the project. The Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission also approved $645,000 in Tobacco Region Opportunity Funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dhiyo House is eligible to receive state benefits from the Virginia Enterprise Zone Program, which is administered by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development. Funding and services to support the company&amp;rsquo;s employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Indiana Manufacturing Jobs Rise for Fourth Straight Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment increased in Indiana for a fourth straight year, according to the 2015 Indiana Manufacturers Directory, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. (MNI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Indiana manufacturers added 7,447 jobs from April 2014 to April 2015. The state is now home to 9,351 manufacturers employing 575,985 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Indiana&amp;#39;s industrial base has achieved a remarkable turnaround following the recession&amp;#39;s steep losses,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;The recovery of the state&amp;#39;s transportation equipment sector was among the most impressive in the nation, while its low labor costs and friendly business environment continue to fuel growth in a variety of sectors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment gains were led by the transportation equipment sector, which climbed 3.2 percent over the year and 16 percent over the past four years, ranking first in the state for industrial employment with 95,146 jobs. The state&amp;#39;s second and third top sectors by employment also posted gains, with second-ranked industrial machinery up 1 percent and third-ranked fabricated metals up 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for Indiana&amp;#39;s manufacturing sector included GM&amp;#39;s announcement of its $1.2-billion investment in Fort Wayne&amp;#39;s pickup truck plant and Alcoa&amp;#39;s establishment of the world&amp;#39;s largest aluminum-lithium aerospace factory in Lafayette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other manufacturers announcing plant openings in the state included Samtec, which will build a new electronics facility in Scottsburg, Janesville Acoustics, which plans a new operation in Richmond, and Boar&amp;#39;s Head, which will open a processing plant in New Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment declines were reported in furniture/fixtures, stone/clay/glass, primary metals and paper products. Industrial locations announcing closures included furniture maker Mobel Inc. in Ferdinand and ATI Castings in LaPorte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment in Indianapolis remained steady over the year, with the city currently home to the most manufacturing workers at 73,704. Elkhart posted a 5.1-percent manufacturing employment increase and ranks second in the state for number of workers with 30,759 jobs. Third-ranked Fort Wayne accounts for 25,211 jobs, while fourth-ranked Evansville is home to 16,376 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Titan Stainless to Build South Carolina Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Custom stainless equipment manufacturer Titan Stainless recently announced that it will build a new manufacturing facility in Pageland, South Carolina. The $2.6-million investment is expected to create 50 new jobs over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant will allow Titan Stainless to meet increased customer demand. Construction of the 50,000-square-foot facility is expected to be completed in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We at Titan Stainless are very excited about our move to Pageland, South Carolina,&amp;quot; said Titan Stainless president Dillon Melton. &amp;quot;The foresight of the state and local governments in South Carolina has created a business-friendly atmosphere that allows for job creation. This benefits all South Carolinians. We are proud to call South Carolina home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hyundai's Alabama Plant Reaches Production Milestone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama (HMMA) recently celebrated a production milestone by completing the 3 millionth Hyundai vehicle built at its plant in Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The production of HMMA&amp;#39;s milestone vehicle comes a little more than 10 years since the start of mass production at the $1.8-billion facility on May 20, 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The commitment and dedication of our nearly 3,000 team members has allowed HMMA to achieve this production milestone faster than any other automotive assembly plant in the southeastern U.S. and fulfill our commitment to more than 3 million Hyundai customers across North America,&amp;quot; said Jun Ha Kim, HMMA president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama is the sole production source of the Sonata sedan for the North American market. The plant also produces the Elantra sedan and 4-cylinder engines that power each vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HMMA employs nearly 3,000 full-time team members at its 3.2-million-square-foot Montgomery facility and has the capacity to produce as many as 400,000 vehicles and 700,000 engines each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through May, HMMA vehicles represent 44 percent of Hyundai Motor America&amp;#39;s 2015 sales in the United States. HMMA also exports vehicles to Canada. The assembly plant&amp;#39;s shipments to Canada have accounted for 25 percent of Hyundai Auto Canada&amp;#39;s sales during the first five months of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar Inc. recently entered into a strategic alliance with Modustri to help customers optimize parts performance and further understand the health of their equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar and Modustri will work together to develop innovations that enhance customers&amp;#39; abilities to measure wear on parts, which in turn will help them optimize their fleets more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are at the forefront of a revolution in the heavy equipment industry,&amp;quot; said Greg Folley, vice president of the newly formed analytics and innovation division at Caterpillar. &amp;quot;Emerging technologies are changing the way we can help customers maintain a competitive advantage and achieve new levels of equipment productivity and profitability. Our alliance with Modustri will be key in making this happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By utilizing Web-based and mobile platforms, the companies will deliver simplified processes that provide customers accurate and immediate access to useful, real-time data while still in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve seen how mobile technology can change the behaviors of customers,&amp;quot; said Brian Steketee, founder and CEO of Modustri. &amp;quot;Now we can see groundbreaking hardware and software that can help dealers interact with customers, build trust and plan ahead for maintenance and parts replacements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the coming months, Caterpillar will collaborate with Modustri and the Cat dealer network to create equipment wear management technologies through Web-based and mobile platforms, which will then be available for customer use.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GRI Renewable Industries to Build Wind Tower Manufacturing Plant in Texas</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/6/18/69909f2e-66dd-4a6f-9ea2-e6bdb9130df1_wind towers.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 188px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;GRI Renewable Industries recently announced that the company is in negotiations with the Economic Development Corp. of Amarillo, Texas, regarding construction of a facility to manufacture wind towers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proposed project is expected to employ approximately 300 people and supply the U.S. market with approximately 400 wind towers per year. The facility is scheduled to be fully operational in late 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With this new factory in the U.S. market, GRI will utilize its experience and knowhow as a leading global supplier of wind towers,&amp;quot; said Javier Imaz, CEO of GRI. &amp;quot;We initially considered locations in several states as part of our business strategy to serve the U.S. wind industry. Our decision to select Amarillo included key factors such as the pro-business environment in the state of Texas, Amarillo&amp;rsquo;s favorable geographical location and good workforce as well as a package of state and local incentives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the industrial wind division of Gonvarri Steel Industries, GRI Renewable Industries currently has 10 manufacturing plants in Spain, Brazil, China, Turkey, India and South Africa that manufacture and supply wind towers and flanges to the wind energy industry worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Michelin to Invest $22 Million to Increase Capacity at Alabama Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Michelin North America recently announced that it will invest $22 million in its facility in Dothan, Alabama, to increase the production of its high-performance light truck and SUV passenger tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The investment will create nearly 40 new jobs at the plant and include significant equipment upgrades that will result in a 10-percent increase in production. Currently, the Dothan facility employs 560 people. Installation of the upgrades has already begun at the facility and is scheduled to be completed by the summer of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Over the past several years, the Dothan site has demonstrated its ability to deliver the high-quality tires that consumers demand from Michelin,&amp;quot; said Pete Selleck, chairman and president of Michelin North America. &amp;quot;This is an exciting time for our Dothan site. The plant just celebrated its 35th anniversary of operation, and this project will help position Dothan to continue to be a strategic part of Michelin&amp;#39;s future in the North American market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since first manufacturing tires at the site in 1975, Michelin has invested more than $8.6 billion in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, Michelin North America employs approximately 21,700 people and operates 20 production facilities in 17 locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The company designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Wood-Mizer Breaks Ground on New Indiana Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/6/10/d7274d8b-94b3-492f-9ec9-dcabf988c8ea_wood-mizer.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 172px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Sawmill manufacturer Wood-Mizer recently broke ground on a new facility in Batesville, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing plant, which is scheduled for completion in December 2015, will produce Wood-Mizer&amp;#39;s line of portable sawmills, industrial sawmills and wood-processing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility replaces the company&amp;#39;s current sawmill manufacturing plant in New Point, Indiana, and will bring 120 jobs to the area while creating 15 additional job opportunities for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It was a priority for Wood-Mizer to build our new manufacturing plant in southeast Indiana, and we are blessed to have the cooperation of the city of Batesville along with expertise from American Structurepoint and Maxwell Construction in order to make that happen,&amp;quot; said Wood-Mizer chief operating officer Darryl Floyd. &amp;quot;Our new facility will allow Wood-Mizer to continue to meet the global demand of our products and be a strategic member of the business community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 77,000-square-foot plant will initially consist of 69,000 square feet of manufacturing space with 8,000 square feet of office space and will be designed to allow for future expansions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Indianapolis, Wood-Mizer has been a leading manufacturer of portable band sawmills for more than 32 years.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kubota to Expand U.S. Manufacturing Operations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kubota Tractor Corporation (KTC) and Kubota Manufacturing of America Corporation (KMA) recently announced plans to increase production capacity for Kubota equipment in the United States by building a new manufacturing plant and expanding its existing operations in Gainesville, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;#39;s expansion plans come on the heels of KTC&amp;#39;s recent announcement that it will relocate its U.S. headquarters to Grapevine, Texas, in an effort to get closer to its major markets and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Georgia plant will be located in Gainesville-Hall County, three miles from KMA&amp;#39;s existing facilities. The new building will be an estimated 502,000 square feet. The existing KMA facility, which has been in operation since 1988 and employs approximately 1,300 people, will also undergo enhancements to increase its production capacity to support Kubota&amp;#39;s growing turf business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The demand for Kubota products continues to grow in the U.S.,&amp;quot; said Hironobu Kubota, president of KMA. &amp;quot;We estimate that this expansion of our operations will allow us to increase production capacity by 60 percent over the next five years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The announcement further demonstrates the company&amp;#39;s commitment to support its growing product offerings with operational excellence as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Growing our manufacturing operations in Georgia will enable us to achieve even greater operational efficiencies to make Kubota&amp;#39;s business stronger and more competitive,&amp;quot; said Masato Yoshikawa, president and CEO of KTC. &amp;quot;We will be better equipped to respond to market needs more quickly, satisfying both dealer and customer demand for Kubota&amp;#39;s popular subcompact tractors, turf products and utility vehicles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both KTC and KMA are U.S. subsidiaries of Kubota Corporation, which is based in Osaka, Japan. Construction of the new facility in Gainesville is expected to begin in September 2015 with a goal to begin mass production in spring of 2017. The new plant will manufacture Kubota&amp;#39;s RTV series of utility vehicles, with the capacity to produce 50,000 units annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kubota has been operating in the state of Georgia for more than 40 years, with its first operations located in Norcross. In the mid-1980s, Kubota purchased its first office building in the state at the current KTC Southeast Division headquarters in Suwanee. Since that time, Kubota has further expanded its operation in Georgia to include KMA in Gainesville, its national distribution center in Jefferson and Kubota Industrial Equipment, which is also in Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Iowa Gains Manufacturing Jobs for Fourth Consecutive Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment increased in Iowa for a fourth straight year, according to the 2015 Iowa Manufacturers Register, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. (MNI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Iowa manufacturers added 2,204 jobs from February 2014 to February 2015. Industrial employment in the state has risen 4 percent since February 2011, recovering 41 percent of jobs lost during the recession but lagging behind the national average increase of 5.8 percent reported by the Labor Department for the same time period. Iowa is now home to 5,291 manufacturers employing 269,067 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With its low business costs, access to capital and diverse economy, manufacturers continue to find Iowa a great place to do business,&amp;rdquo; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;ldquo;However, the state could benefit from greater workforce initiatives, as many manufacturing positions go unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gains were led by the industrial machinery and fabricated metals sectors, which ranked second and third, respectively, for the number of Iowa factory jobs. Employment in industrial machinery manufacturing rose 3.4 percent over the year, and employment in the fabricated metals sector climbed 2.9 percent. The chemicals sector also posted a gain, up 12.4 percent, as did electronics and transportation equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cedar Rapids reported a 4.9-percent increase over the year and ranks as Iowa&amp;rsquo;s largest city by manufacturing employment with 21,085 jobs. Manufacturing employment also rose 1 percent in Davenport but declined 3.8 percent in Dubuque and fell 1.6 percent in Des Moines.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mitsubishi Turbocharger Plant Begins Production in Indiana</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) recently began full-scale production at its newly established turbocharger manufacturing plant in Franklin, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new production base is MHI&amp;#39;s response to anticipated growth in demand for turbochargers in the North American market amid the trend toward vehicles meeting increasingly tighter fuel-efficiency standards. Initially, the new plant will have an annual production capacity of 600,000 units before progressively increasing to 1.2 million units and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MHI is currently undertaking investments to increase its turbocharger production capacities worldwide, aiming for an annual global output of 10 million units. The company will further step up its efforts to respond swiftly to expanding demand for turbochargers with flexible production in North America, Europe (the Netherlands), China, Thailand and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Franklin facility has been established as a production plant of Mitsubishi Engine North America (MENA). Under a shared factory arrangement, the new dedicated turbocharger production lines have been created in a newly expanded building and an existing building where compressors for car air-conditioning systems are manufactured for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Climate Control (MCCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides the final assembly line for turbochargers, the area in the factory exclusively used by MENA also contains storage space for both assembly components and finished products. The area shared by MENA and MCCA is to be used for inspection, distribution and other related work tasks. On the assembly floor, finished products will be produced by attaching housings and other components to the core cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Volvo Cars Selects South Carolina for First American Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Volvo Car Corporation has selected South Carolina&amp;#39;s Berkeley County for its first manufacturing facility in the Western hemisphere. The new $500-million plant is expected to create 2,000 new jobs over the next decade and up to 4,000 jobs by 2030. The new facility will have an initial estimated annual production capacity of around 100,000 cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Located in northwestern Berkeley County on a portion of the Camp Hall site, the plant will manufacture the latest-generation Volvo models for sale in the United States and for export. Construction will begin in early fall 2015, with the first vehicles expected to roll off the assembly line in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new U.S. plant forms part of an ambitious medium-term expansion plan for Volvo to double global sales, boost market share and lift profitability. Volvo began importing cars to the U.S. in 1955. With the development of an American factory, the company crosses an important threshold from an automotive importer to a domestic manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Volvo Cars&amp;#39; location decision was taken as a result of its easy access to international ports and infrastructure, a well-trained labor force, attractive investment environment and experience in the high-tech manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re excited to build our first American factory in South Carolina, and we look forward to helping grow the local community and economy,&amp;quot; said Lex Kerssemakers, Volvo Cars of North America president and CEO. &amp;quot;We were impressed with the friendliness, work ethic and passion of the people in the Charleston area.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the broader scope, Volvo Cars&amp;#39; selection of the Palmetto State underlines the success of South Carolina&amp;#39;s robust automobile industry. Today, the state is home to more than 250 automotive-related companies and suppliers and, as a result, leads the nation in the export of both tires and automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With today&amp;#39;s announcement, South Carolina&amp;#39;s strong auto industry looks to get even stronger. An economic impact analysis compiled by Dr. Frank Hefner at the College of Charleston estimates that, for an initial 2,000 direct jobs, more than 8,000 total jobs would be created as a result. Operating with 2,000 employees, the plant would contribute approximately $4.8 billion in total economic output on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the development of the Camp Hall site will lead to the preservation, restoration and enhancement of more than 1,500 acres of wetlands in a neighboring watershed that is a priority of Audubon South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Daimler Trucks to Increase Production, Add Jobs at North Carolina Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Daimler Trucks North America recently announced plans to increase production and employment levels at its truck manufacturing plant in Mt. Holly, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant will add a third shift to its operations and plans to fill the additional 580 manufacturing and 25 related supervision, engineering and administrative positions by mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mt. Holly plant manufactures Freightliner M2 Business Class medium-duty diesel and natural gas-powered trucks, as well as Freightliner&amp;#39;s line of 108SD and 114SD trucks built for the severe-duty vocational truck markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The more than 600 new employees will be added to accommodate rising customer demand. These positions will be in addition to the more than 2,300 positions filled in the company&amp;#39;s truck and parts facilities during 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our vehicle manufacturing network is highly scalable, and together with our component suppliers, we are fully prepared to handle current and projected new truck order levels,&amp;quot; said Roger Nielsen, chief operating officer of Daimler Trucks North America. &amp;quot;The untapped capacity at the Mt. Holly plant provides us the capacity and the leverage to meet customer delivery schedules in today&amp;#39;s fast-paced economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Daimler Trucks North America produces and markets commercial vehicles under the Freightliner, Western Star and Thomas Built Buses nameplates.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Modine Announces Plans to Close Iowa Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Modine Manufacturing recently announced plans to close its manufacturing plant in Washington, Iowa. The decision is dependent upon the conclusion of bargaining with the union at the Washington facility. The closure, which will impact approximately 245 full-time employees, reflects Modine&amp;#39;s proactive focus on operating scale production facilities across the globe in order to remain cost-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Washington plant makes liquid charge air coolers, plate oil coolers and fuel coolers for the automotive, commercial vehicle and off-highway markets. Modine plans to transfer the Washington production to other facilities in North America, including those in Mexico and Missouri. Plans call for the plant to close over an approximate 24-month period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Closing operations is never easy,&amp;quot; said Scott Wollenberg, Modine&amp;#39;s regional vice president. &amp;quot;However, our analysis of Modine&amp;#39;s global product lines and North American manufacturing strategy led us to conclude that the best long-term solution for Modine and its shareholders is to consolidate all the Washington products into other North American facilities. We are committed to making the transition as seamless as possible for our customers and to assisting our affected employees during the transition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In connection with the upcoming closure, the company expects to incur a charge of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of its 2016 fiscal year, with total closure costs of approximately $3 million over the entire closure period. Modine anticipates it will generate annual savings of at least $9 million once the closure is completed in fiscal 2018, as well as additional revenue opportunities and growth in vehicular markets due to the more competitive cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin, with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, Modine specializes in thermal management systems and components.

            <title>Worthington Industries to Close South Carolina Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Worthington Industries recently announced that it will close its engineered cabs facility in Florence, South Carolina, effective September 2015. The closure will impact approximately 310 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also announced a workforce reduction impacting approximately 245 employees at its oil and gas equipment locations in Garden City, Kansas; Skiatook, Oklahoma; and Bremen and Wooster, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The weaker market conditions in engineered cabs combined with a need for significant capital investments to address production challenges led to this decision,&amp;quot; said John McConnell, Worthington Industries&amp;#39; chairman and CEO. &amp;quot;We will be transitioning business to our Greeneville, Tennessee, operations to better serve our customers. These decisions that so deeply impact the lives of our employees are never easy or taken lightly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Worthington will record a non-cash charge of approximately $81.6 million for restructuring and the impairment of the goodwill, intangible and certain fixed assets of the engineered cabs business, as well as a $2.3-million restructuring charge for severance benefits related to the workforce reductions at the oil and gas equipment locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Severance packages will be provided based on years of service, and employment assistance will be offered to employees in Florence and in the oil and gas locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Worthington is a value-added steel processor that employs approximately 11,000 people and operates 84 facilities in 11 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Manufacturers' Survey Reveals Continued Optimism for 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent survey of U.S. industrial manufacturing companies showed continued optimism in the economy and positive growth expectations in several industries. The survey, which was conducted by Prime Advantage, revealed the financial projections and top economic concerns of midsized manufacturing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Revenues and Capital Spending Remain Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The financial executives polled for the survey predict another impressive year is on the horizon for small and midsized industrial manufacturers, as 90 percent expect revenues to increase or match 2014. Much of this optimism can be attributed to strong order pipelines, with 50 percent of member companies seeing new orders exceeding the levels they saw at this time last year. In another encouraging result, 100 percent of respondents anticipate revenue growth with their key customers over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Small and midsized manufacturing CFOs are placing greater focus on production this year, as an all-time survey high of 96 percent expect to procure manufacturing equipment in 2015. Other major purchases of note include 44 percent of respondents planning to buy computer hardware and software throughout the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Employment up in Manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Small and midsized manufacturing firms are still struggling to find qualified workers to help with ramping up as their industries look for growth. More than 70 percent of companies are experiencing difficulty finding capable employees in their markets, with most stating that this is due to insufficient levels of skilled employees in their area. Manufacturers are also concerned about maintaining morale and productivity within their existing workforce during this hunt for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Competition Increases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once again, price pressure from competition is the external factor causing the most anxiety for manufacturers, as three-fourths place this concern at the top. Customer demand is the second biggest apprehension, clocking in as a top fear for 67 percent of CFOs. This is the fourth consecutive year that price pressure from competition and customer demand ranked as the top two concerns. Distress over foreign competition cracks the top three for the first time in this survey&amp;rsquo;s history, most likely as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In the race to achieve 2015 growth goals, our members and endorsed suppliers are strapping on their mental hardhats and crafting inventive solutions with inspired business strategies on a daily basis,&amp;quot; said Louise O&amp;rsquo;Sullivan, founder, president and CEO of Prime Advantage. &amp;quot;Our members are leveraging digital tools, additive manufacturing and other advancements to operate more efficiently while building superior products.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Economic Concerns Lessen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Confidence in the U.S. economy among participating companies rose four points over last year, as half of respondents indicated that they are more optimistic about the U.S. economy compared to 2014. Notably this year, the CFOs&amp;rsquo; expectations for their own companies&amp;rsquo; financial prospects and for the U.S. economy have converged. For the past several years, significantly more CFOs expressed confidence in their own companies than in the economy overall. But there is now rising confidence in the U.S. economy with 50 percent expecting growth, a record for this survey.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>UniCarriers Acquires Nissan Industrial Engine Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	UniCarriers Americas recently announced the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Nissan Industrial Engine Manufacturing (NIEM). NIEM has been renamed Global Components Technologies Americas (GCTA) and becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of UniCarriers Americas (UCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NIEM supplies high-quality engines for several forklift models produced by UniCarriers Americas, as well as to customers throughout the Americas. This transaction is part of UniCarriers Americas&amp;#39; overall strategy to transfer the Nissan industrial engine business into the UniCarriers family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The business of manufacturing Nissan forklift engines is an important part of our heritage,&amp;quot; said Anthony Salgado, president of UniCarriers Americas Corp. &amp;quot;It represents the heart and soul of our main product line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the new ownership, GCTA will continue to assemble and distribute the K21 and K25 engines in Marengo, Illinois, as part of the UniCarriers family. GCTA will work in cooperation with Global Components Technologies (GCT) in Japan, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of UniCarriers Corp., focused on designing, manufacturing and distributing gas and diesel engine assemblies, transmissions and attachments for UniCarriers products, aftermarket support and customers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, GCT began production at the Konosu engine plant outside of Tokyo, where the new Tier 4-compliant diesel engines will be produced beginning in 2016. The new GCT plant will also serve as the primary production site for the next generation of K21 and K25 engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are excited to complete this very important transaction,&amp;quot; said Salgado. &amp;quot;As we continue to invest in our global growth, a top priority is ensuring that UniCarriers Americas has the ability to control and build upon our proven and reliable internal combustion technology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Korean Light Manufacturer to Build New Georgia Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal recently announced that Korea-based light manufacturer Wells Lighting will locate its first North American headquarters in Millen, Georgia, creating more than 200 jobs and investing $30 million in the project over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The state of Georgia has long valued our relationship with Korea, a partnership that has paid dividends for both Koreans and for Georgians,&amp;quot; said Deal. &amp;quot;Wells Lighting&amp;#39;s decision to establish its first North American headquarters in our state tells us that our qualified workforce, diverse business network and pro-business environment continue to attract investment from leading companies around the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Established in 2008, Wells Lighting produces general lighting/streetlights, industrial lighting, solar street lights and smart control system lights. The company will locate to an existing 92,000-square-foot building, which will house the company&amp;#39;s headquarter operations, research and development initiatives, and manufacturing operations for its new LED lighting production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;After much consideration, Georgia was the ideal place for us to locate our U.S. operations,&amp;quot; said Wells Lighting CEO and chairman Dae Woo Kim. &amp;quot;As the demand for our product continues to grow, we are confident that we can best meet our customers with our U.S. operations in Jenkins County.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nissan to Expand Tennessee Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan recently announced a new $160-million supplier park project at the company&amp;#39;s vehicle assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee. The project will support more than 1,000 newly created supplier jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Today marks an exciting new chapter in our more than 31-year partnership with the state of Tennessee as we continue our localization and investment efforts in the United States,&amp;quot; said Jos&amp;eacute; Mu&amp;ntilde;oz, executive vice president for Nissan Motor Co. &amp;quot;This project is a key component to the long-term sustainability of our U.S. business as we close in on a goal of 10 percent U.S. market share.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Current plans for the project call for construction of an integrated logistics center that will be located on Nissan&amp;#39;s Smyrna campus and is more than 1.5 million square feet in size. The integrated logistics center will serve as an immediate space for suppliers and be used for multiple purposes supporting operations including inbound production parts and outbound returnable containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Nissan and Tennessee have enjoyed a long and successful partnership, and today&amp;#39;s announcement is another significant milestone in our history together,&amp;quot; said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. &amp;quot;The success of Tennessee&amp;#39;s automotive industry brings with it growth in supplier networks, and we want to thank Nissan for this new investment in Smyrna and our state.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project will provide essential space to support the onsite suppliers necessary for continued growth, while further supporting Nissan&amp;#39;s overall strategy to bring more production to the United States. Nissan builds 85 percent of its vehicles sold in the United States in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Nissan Smyrna plant began operations in 1983 and employs more than 8,400 people. In 2014, the Smyrna plant assembled more than 648,000 vehicles, making it the highest producing automotive assembly plant in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production for the 2016 Maxima will begin in Smyrna later this year. Smyrna employees currently build the Altima, Maxima, all-electric Leaf, Rogue crossover, Pathfinder SUV and Infiniti QX60 luxury crossover.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>4 Benefits of Outsourcing Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/18/53e88ebc-8843-49f2-9620-bfc2c84723bd_RC person on world_091504 asd 02.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 304px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Production needs can often be met completely in-house. However, if there are changes in demand or production capacity, the organization may require additional resources. If outsourcing alternatives exist, the company can be in a position to grow without accumulating overhead, tying up resources or suffering in order fulfillment unnecessarily.&amp;nbsp;Following are four key benefits of outsourcing manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lower Labor Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lower labor costs are one of the top benefits of outsourcing manufacturing. While there may be broader humanitarian and compliance implications at play, outsourcing under the right circumstances can be a viable option. Labor can be performed at a fraction of the cost for some manufacturers with the right partnership. Most organizations find that they can achieve real savings and focus more on their core business when they consider outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fuel Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Innovation can be brought to life much quicker through outsourcing. A company may not have the tools or production scheduling that permits creating new pieces or items. Access to an outsourcing resource makes it possible to quickly schedule prototyping and other production-related functions without reallocating internal resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Support Increased Demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Outsourcing is wonderful for addressing an uptick in demand for different types of products. Companies may experience a sudden surge in orders for a particular product and may require additional resources to keep up with demand. A lack of resources available to devote to production could affect an organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to meet fulfillment obligations. An outsourcing company can supplement existing in-house manufacturing efforts and make it easier to meet those new demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Contribute to Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There may be inefficiencies in the production process. If the organization has decided to handle all of its production needs internally, there may be inefficiencies that go unaddressed. For example, a company may not have the capacity to tweak certain processes because of several different types of product design requirements that must be accommodated within the manufacturing facility. It is often much smarter to outsource manufacturing, especially if the outsourcing company is able to produce the product with greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The biggest advantages to outsourcing come with saving money on production costs and improving efficiency across the board. Indeed, it may be much more cost-effective to produce pieces with an alternative manufacturing resource in an environment where things can be made with greater efficiency. Strides in the area of innovation and improved production capacity are additional advantages to working with an outsourced manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mercedes-Benz to Open New Van Manufacturing Plant in South Carolina</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mercedes-Benz Vans recently announced that it will invest nearly half a billion dollars to build a new van manufacturing plant in Charleston, South Carolina. The new facility will supply the North American market with the next-generation Sprinter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than 1,300 new jobs are expected to be created with the new plant, making Mercedes-Benz Vans one of the largest industrial employers in the region. The facility will cover more than 200 acres and include a body shop, paint shop and assembly line. Construction of the new factory is scheduled to begin in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This plant is key to our future growth in the very dynamic North American van market,&amp;quot; said Volker Mornhinweg, head of Mercedes-Benz Vans. &amp;quot;Charleston is an excellent location for our new plant. The region has very highly skilled workers, a dense network of reliable suppliers and an outstanding logistics infrastructure that includes good transport connections to the nearby harbor.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Available in the United States since 2001, the Sprinter holds approximately 9 percent of the country&amp;#39;s large van market. Mercedes-Benz Vans offers the Sprinter as both a Mercedes-Benz and a Freightliner-branded vehicle. Sprinters of both brands will roll off the assembly line at the future plant in Charleston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides the Sprinter, the MercedesâBenz Vans division will also add the Metris series of medium-sized vans to its U.S. product range later in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ABB to Build $30-million Manufacturing Facility in Memphis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Power and automation technology group ABB recently announced that it will invest $30 million in building a new manufacturing site and expanding its customer experience center for its low-voltage products division in the Memphis, Tennessee, area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The investment will initially create more than 200 jobs, with an additional 100 jobs expected to be added over the next five years. ABB&amp;#39;s total workforce in the Americas has tripled over the last five years to nearly 20,000 as the company has expanded across the region, including its $3.9-billion purchase of Memphis-based electrical components maker Thomas and Betts in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility will be located in the Memphis area and will cover more than 120,000 square feet. Products from across the ABB low-voltage product portfolio will be assembled at the site, including the world&amp;#39;s first integrated breaker and power manager, as well as other breakers, switches, power distribution systems and control products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This investment supports the increasing demand for the ABB portfolio,&amp;quot; said Brian Herington, ABB&amp;#39;s Americas region division head. &amp;quot;We have exciting growth plans and intend to ensure that we build on our reputation as the supplier of choice in this market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the new facility, ABB will invest in a new customer experience center at its existing Memphis location, which is now the Americas headquarters for the division. The business will upgrade its training suite to accommodate the requirements of its expanding product portfolio and commitment to technical support and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating in roughly 100 countries, the ABB group of companies employs nearly 140,000 people. The company&amp;#39;s North American operations, which is headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, employs approximately 20,000 people in multiple manufacturing, service, engineering and other major facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturing Institute Honors 130 Women with STEP Ahead Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Manufacturing Institute recently announced that it will award 130 women with the Women in Manufacturing STEP (Science, Technology, Engineering and Production) Ahead Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The STEP Ahead Awards honor women who have demonstrated excellence and leadership in their careers and represent all levels of the manufacturing industry. In 2015, STEP Ahead launched Emerging Leaders awards to recognize women currently employed in the manufacturing industry who have already made significant contributions and excelled early in their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These 130 women are the faces of exciting careers in manufacturing,&amp;quot; said Jennifer McNelly, president of the Manufacturing Institute. &amp;quot;We chose to honor these women because they each made significant achievements in manufacturing through a positive impact on their company and the industry as a whole.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The STEP Awards are part of the larger STEP Ahead initiative, which was launched to examine and promote the role of women in the manufacturing industry through recognition, research and leadership for attracting, advancing and retaining strong female talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent survey from Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute found that 80 percent of American manufacturing companies have a moderate to severe shortage of available, qualified workers.&amp;nbsp; Contributing to this gap is the underrepresentation of women in the industry. While women make up approximately 50 percent of the labor force, that number is only about 25 percent in the manufacturing labor force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 130 STEP Award recipients will be recognized at a gala on March 26 in Washington, D.C. The STEP Awards program will highlight the honorees&amp;#39; stories, including their leadership and accomplishments in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Manufacturing Faces a 2-million Worker Shortage</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The United States faces a need for nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs over the next decade, and 2 million of those jobs are likely to go unfilled due to a skills gap, according to new research from Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two parallel studies &amp;mdash; &amp;quot;The Skills Gap in U.S. Manufacturing: 2015 and Beyond&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Overwhelming Support: U.S. Public Opinions on the Manufacturing Industry&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; draw perspectives from U.S. manufacturing executives and the American public to reveal that American manufacturing companies face a significant skills gap over the next decade, largely fueled by baby boomer retirement and too few young people who see the industry as a career destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The research shows that 84 percent of manufacturing executives agree there is a talent shortage in U.S. manufacturing, and this gap will be exacerbated by more than 2.7 million professionals exiting the manufacturing workforce through retirement over the next 10 years,&amp;quot; said Craig Giffi, Deloitte&amp;#39;s vice chairman. &amp;quot;Our research estimates that the cumulative skills gap &amp;mdash; or the positions that likely won&amp;rsquo;t be filled due to a lack of skilled workers &amp;mdash; will grow to 2 million between 2015 and 2025.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Roughly eight in 10 manufacturing executives (82 percent) feel that workforce shortages or skills deficiencies in production roles have a significant impact on their ability to meet customer demand, and 78 percent indicate that it impacts their ability to implement new technologies and increase productivity. Manufacturing executives responding to the skills gap survey indicated that six of every 10 skilled production openings they have are unfilled today due to the talent shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While 80 percent of executives report they are willing to pay higher salaries than the market rates in workforce areas reeling under the talent crisis, the industry appears to suffer from an inability to fill positions expeditiously. The manufacturing executives surveyed report that it takes more than 90 days to recruit highly skilled workers such as engineers and scientists, and an average of 70 days to recruit skilled production workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Traditional past practices and methods used for recruiting and developing workers needed for the future of manufacturing are simply not going to be adequate,&amp;quot; said Benjamin Dollar, Deloitte Consulting principal and co-author of the studies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With nearly half of executive survey respondents indicating they plan to re-shore some portion of their operations back to the United States by 2020, the urgency to expand the domestic talent pool and address the skills gap is increasing day by day,&amp;quot; added Gardner Carrick, vice president of the Manufacturing Institute. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a separate survey of the American public, an overwhelming majority of Americans believe manufacturing is crucial to the country&amp;#39;s economic prosperity, standard of living and national security. However, less than half believe the U.S. can compete globally in manufacturing today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nevertheless, it appears Americans see disparity in the level of action being taken by policy makers compared to the relative importance of manufacturing. If given the opportunity to add 1,000 new jobs in their community, Americans ranked the manufacturing industry as their first choice relative to all other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While 77 percent of Americans surveyed believe a strong manufacturing base should be a national priority, 83 percent indicate the U.S. needs a more strategic approach to developing a manufacturing base, and 82 percent believe the U.S. should further invest in the manufacturing industry. Nearly two-thirds of the American public do not believe federal government leadership or corporate tax policies are an advantage for U.S. competitiveness relative to other countries. And over half feel that neither U.S. trade policies nor environmental regulations are providing U.S. companies with an advantage relative to competitors in other countries. Manufacturers appear to agree, as 86 percent of executives surveyed feel government policies have a negative impact on job growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The public understands that manufacturing must be as much a part of America&amp;#39;s future as it was in our past,&amp;quot; said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. &amp;quot;Americans know that manufacturing strengthens not just an economy but also communities, peoples&amp;#39; lives and our country. It&amp;#39;s time Washington listened to the people and adopted a comprehensive manufacturing strategy to secure world-leading manufacturing in the United States and American exceptionalism long into the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite this apparent support for manufacturing from the American public, respondents show a much different attitude toward manufacturing as a career path. While over half of the respondents believe the manufacturing industry provides careers that are interesting and rewarding, and a similar percentage believe a career in the manufacturing industry provides a good income relative to other industries, only a little more than one in three parents would encourage their children to pursue a career in manufacturing, mainly due to lack of stability and their belief that manufacturing jobs are the first to be moved offshore. As a result, manufacturing ranked fifth out of seven industries as their choice to start a career today, and it ranked last as a choice for the all-important generation Y respondents (those between the ages of 19 and 33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is not a significant surprise Americans are not selecting the manufacturing industry as their top career choice, given they believe manufacturing jobs are the first to move to other countries and our policy makers are not providing the leadership to help create an advantage for U.S. manufacturers relative to other countries,&amp;quot; added Giffi. &amp;quot;Overall, executives and the general public agree, manufacturing is vital to America. Now is the time to address the talent issue and policy changes necessary to ensure future U.S. competitiveness &amp;mdash; before it&amp;#39;s too late.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nearly all surveyed executives agree that internal employee training and development programs are the most effective skilled production worker development strategies. They also cite involvement with local schools and community colleges, external training and certification programs, and creation of new veteran hiring programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Just as every company engineers its product lines, its supply chain and its production process, you can engineer a talent pipeline,&amp;quot; according to Jennifer McNelly, president of the Manufacturing Institute. &amp;quot;Manufacturers can no longer afford to wait for an educated and trained next generation of manufacturing talent. They will need to do more to develop their talent pool, and the same old approaches no longer apply.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers have turned to analytics to better understand their production capabilities, though few are using it to help identify internal or external candidates to fit their positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While much progress has been made in rolling out skills certification, we must accelerate our efforts to keep pace with the daunting challenge facing the U.S. manufacturing industry over the next decade,&amp;quot; McNelly added. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AK Steel to Construct New $36-million Facility in Ohio</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel recently announced that it will build a new world-class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio. The 120,000-square-foot facility will be constructed on a 15-acre site located in the Cincinnati-Dayton growth corridor along Interstate 75. The estimated project cost is $36 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new research and innovation center will replace the company&amp;#39;s existing research facility that is located at another site in Middletown. AK Steel&amp;#39;s largest steel manufacturing plant is also in Middletown, and the company&amp;#39;s corporate headquarters is in nearby West Chester, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Construction of this new research and innovation center underscores AK Steel&amp;#39;s strong commitment to the future of steelmaking in America and to our company&amp;#39;s continued industry leadership as a technological innovator in the steel business,&amp;quot; said James L. Wainscott, chairman, president and CEO of AK Steel. &amp;quot;The new center will be customer-focused, providing advanced technical support to our valued customers, as well as developing new and improved steel products for a number of our markets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility will be home to the company&amp;#39;s approximately 75 researchers, scientists and engineers who will perform cutting-edge research, applications engineering, advanced engineering, product development and customer technical services. The facility will also house pilot lines that simulate the company&amp;#39;s steel manufacturing operations, ranging from melting and casting to hot- and cold-rolling to final finishing. The pilot lines will be used for research, enhancing existing products, problem-solving in production and experimentation for new and improved products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Groundbreaking for the new facility is planned for late spring or early summer of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel employs approximately 8,000 men and women at eight steel plants, two coke plants and two tube manufacturing plants across six states: Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ohio Adds Industrial Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For a third straight year, industrial employment in Ohio posted a gain, according to the 2015 Ohio Manufacturers Directory, a manufacturers&amp;#39; database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Ohio manufacturers added 7,743 industrial jobs from September 2013 to September 2014, which was slightly less than the national average gain reported by the Labor Department for the same time period. Ohio is now home to 17,261 manufacturers employing 883,204 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Following several years of decline, manufacturing in Ohio is finally beginning to pick up speed,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;The revival of its all-important auto sector and investments in tech and innovation as well as a growing energy sector have helped support growth and boost employment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gains were led by the transportation equipment sector, which posted a 6.1-percent employment increase over the year. This is expected to keep rising with China-based Fuyao&amp;#39;s plans to open an auto parts facility in Moraine, the establishment of UGN Inc.&amp;#39;s auto plant in Monroe, and the expansions of SFS in Medina, Ford&amp;#39;s engine plant in Cleveland, RV maker Airstream in Jackson Center, and Honda&amp;#39;s facility in Anna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in the state&amp;#39;s oil/gas extraction shot up 23 percent as more facilities open to service oil and gas production in the Utica and Marcellus shales, including Anchor Drilling, Evets Fabrication Services and MarkWest Energy. Other Ohio manufacturing sectors adding jobs included instruments/related products, food products, electronics and fabricated metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial machinery and equipment accounts for the most manufacturing employment in Ohio, with 144,985 jobs, while fabricated metals currently ranks second with 104,267 jobs. The transportation equipment sector accounts for 89,645 jobs, ranking it third in the state for industrial employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment losses were recorded in printing/publishing, chemicals, furniture/fixtures, rubber/plastics, and lumber/wood. Industrial locations announcing closures included Ben Venue Laboratories in Bedford and Ormet Corp.&amp;#39;s smelter in Hannibal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cincinnati remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for industrial employment with 73,992 workers. Cleveland was second with 59,580 jobs, while Columbus ranked third with 44,928 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Canadian Manufacturer Expands to Alabama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Fiberglass component manufacturer Carlson Engineered Composites recently announced plans to expand its operations to Anniston, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Canadian company will be locating in an existing 67,000-square-foot building with operations scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2015. The project represents a capital investment of $3 million and will create 75 new jobs in Calhoun County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Alabama is committed to helping the advanced manufacturing sector thrive, and we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturers add jobs through expansions and new facilities across the state,&amp;quot; said Alabama secretary of commerce Greg Canfield. &amp;quot;This project from Carlson is another example of that, and it will deliver substantial benefits to Calhoun County.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Carlson Engineered Composites has a similar production facility in St. Cloud, Minnesota, that manufactures fiberglass composites for original equipment manufacturers in the transportation, agricultural, automotive, recreational and food processing industries. One of the company&amp;#39;s largest automotive customers is New Flyer Industries, which also has a facility in Anniston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re so excited to have Carlson here,&amp;quot; said Larry Deason, chairman of the Calhoun County Economic Development Council. &amp;quot;This is an industry we highly recruited from Winnipeg. They have a great relationship with New Flyer, and we are anticipating even more jobs to come as they increase their market share in the Southeast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CalStar Shifts Production to New Mississippi Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CalStar Products recently announced that is shifting production from the company&amp;#39;s pilot plant in Racine, Wisconsin, to its new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Columbus, Mississippi, resulting in increased capacity and a larger geographic footprint for its sustainable brick, masonry and decorative trim products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CalStar&amp;#39;s Racine plant will maintain its quality assurance and testing facilities, and the majority of the front office staff will continue to support the administrative requirements for the company. The expanded plant will service the North American brick and masonry market, including the Milwaukee and Chicago markets surrounding the Racine pilot operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company will also be adding additional curing capacity to the Columbus plant in order to keep up with the growing demand for a new line of decorative trim cast stone products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re excited for the expansion of our newest Columbus facility as we continue to manufacture America&amp;#39;s only sustainable brick and masonry solution,&amp;quot; said Craig Ratchford, CalStar CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CalStar&amp;#39;s 100,000-square-foot facility in Columbus, Mississippi, sits on 23 acres in the Golden Triangle Industrial Park located in northern Mississippi near the Alabama border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, CalStar&amp;#39;s masonry products incorporate up to 37 percent recycled content, eliminating the need for kiln-firing typical of traditional clay brick or the use of Portland cement to bind concrete masonry products.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Procter &amp; Gamble to Build $500-million Plant in West Virginia</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Procter &amp;amp; Gamble recently announced that it will build a new manufacturing plant in West Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Berkeley County. The new facility is just the second manufacturing location that the company has built in the United States since 1971 and represents an investment of approximately $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant, which will be located just south of Martinsburg, will occupy more than 1 million square feet. During the construction phase, approximately 1,000 workers will be employed. Company officials expect more than 700 permanent employees will staff the plant when it opens its doors in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new multi-category manufacturing plant is part of a redesign of P&amp;amp;G&amp;#39;s North American supply network. The West Virginia location positions P&amp;amp;G to utilize its new distribution center network in the eastern part of the United States, which includes facilities in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This will enable us to rapidly and efficiently serve retail customers and consumers throughout the eastern half of the United States, reaching 80 percent of them within one-day transit,&amp;quot; said Yannis Skoufalos, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble&amp;#39;s global product supply officer. &amp;quot;We look forward to working with our new partners in West Virginia, as well as being a good corporate citizen in the region for many years to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new manufacturing facility will be P&amp;amp;G&amp;#39;s 30th plant in the United States. The company also has operations in approximately 70 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cogeneration Plant to be Constructed in New York City</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC) recently announced that it will provide $6.3 million of construction and permanent financing for a cogeneration project at a new manufacturing plant in Staten Island, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cogeneration plant will maximize the production of electricity to sell to the grid and the use of waste heat for onsite manufacturing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are excited to enable a project with significant environmental and economic benefits, from substantial energy savings and greenhouse gas reduction to impactful job creation and grid resiliency,&amp;quot; said Jay Merves, director of business development at NYCEEC. &amp;quot;We are proud to be part of a project that serves as a new model for distributed generation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cogeneration project is expected to reduce the manufacturing plant&amp;#39;s energy use by 34 percent and its greenhouse gases by 12 percent as compared to traditional processes. The project will also create construction-related and permanent jobs in Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We share with NYCEEC a commitment to developing cost-effective, energy-efficient projects that strengthen the local economy,&amp;quot; said Leighton Powell, president of Cubit Power Systems. &amp;quot;In NYCEEC, we found a true partner. NYCEEC&amp;#39;s flexible financing and deep engineering expertise were instrumental to getting our project off the ground in a timely manner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New York Loses Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	New York posted another year of industrial job losses, according to the 2015 New York Manufacturers Register, a manufacturers&amp;#39; database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports the state lost 6,959 manufacturing jobs or 1 percent from September 2013 to September 2014, in contrast to the 1.3-percent national average gain as reported by the Labor Department for the same time period. New York is now home to 16,395 manufacturers employing 717,018 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A five-year analysis of MNI data shows industrial jobs in New York have fallen 11.8 percent since September 2009, while government statistics reveal manufacturing employment in the U.S. overall climbed 4.9 percent during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;High business costs and global competition have made it difficult for New York manufacturers to climb back from the recession,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;However, the state remains a major manufacturing hub, boasting an educated workforce, diverse economy and access to capital.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state&amp;#39;s losses were spread out across several industrial sectors, including primary metals, fabricated metals, lumber/wood, paper products, furniture/fixtures, instruments/related products and rubber/plastics. The chemicals industry was the only sector to post a gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Layoffs at Kodak, Tyson Foods and Lockheed Martin contributed to the state&amp;#39;s losses, as well as several plant closures, including an Alcoa facility in Massena, Philips Lighting in Bath, Belden Inc. in Horseheads, Worthington Industries in Medina and Coviden&amp;#39;s medical device plant in Argyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Printing/publishing remains the state&amp;#39;s largest sector by employment with 111,600 jobs. Industrial machinery and equipment ranks second with 78,790 jobs, while electronics was third with 70,404 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in food products remained steady over the year, helped by the state&amp;#39;s fast-growing yogurt industry. Several yogurt and dairy facilities have announced expansions, including FAGE yogurt in Johnstown, O-At-Ka Milk Products in Batavia, Cayuga Milk Products in Aurelius and yogurt maker Emmi Roth USA in Penn Yan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The New York metro area, including the New York City exurbs, accounts for 394,800 manufacturing jobs, with no significant change reported. The western region of the state has the second-most industrial jobs with 175,827 workers. Central New York is home to 96,088 industrial workers, while the Upstate/Adirondack region saw an increase of 1.9 percent over the past 12 months and currently has 50,303 of the state&amp;#39;s industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Wood-Mizer Announces New Indiana Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Sawmill manufacturer Wood-Mizer recently announced plans to build a new 85,000-square-foot production facility in Batesville, Indiana. Scheduled for completion in December 2015, the plant will produce Wood-Mizer&amp;#39;s portable sawmills, industrial sawmills and blade maintenance equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility, which will replace the company&amp;#39;s current sawmill manufacturing plant in New Point, Indiana, will bring 120 jobs to the area while creating 15 additional job opportunities for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The new Wood-Mizer manufacturing facility is an important investment that will bring jobs and opportunity for future economic growth to our community,&amp;quot; said Batesville mayor Rick Fledderman. &amp;quot;We are very eager to work with Wood-Mizer and look forward to our continued partnership in the future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The city of Batesville encouraged Wood-Mizer to build the production plant in Batesville by offering an incentive package that included benefits such as project financing. Wood-Mizer has announced an $8.4-million investment in the land, building, equipment and improvements for the new manufacturing facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Being involved with the Southeast Indiana community for more than 30 years, we wanted to establish an opportunity for expansion for both Wood-Mizer and the local economy,&amp;quot; said Wood-Mizer&amp;#39;s Darryl Floyd. &amp;quot;While becoming one of the largest companies in Batesville, Wood-Mizer is excited to continue manufacturing sawmills in a more efficient and larger capacity at this location, and we&amp;#39;d like to thank the city of Batesville for their assistance in making this opportunity possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Polaris to Build New Plant in Alabama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Polaris Industries recently announced plans to build a new production facility in Huntsville, Alabama, to provide additional capacity and flexibility for the company&amp;#39;s continued growth. The 600,000-square-foot facility will focus on off-road vehicle production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Polaris selected Huntsville due to its skilled workforce, history of technology and innovation, existing utility infrastructure, and strong local and state resources supporting economic development. The 453-acre Huntsville site offers Polaris close proximity to its key customer base in the Southeast United States and strong logistics network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant will become part of the company&amp;#39;s North American plant network, reducing complexity within the existing network and enabling logistics optimization. The facility will have multiple assembly lines providing flexibility to quickly replenish demand and support continued product innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This new facility will complement our already strong and growing North American manufacturing footprint by reducing pressure on our existing facilities and enable each to remain focused on their current product lines as we continue to meet the demand for our innovative, quality products,&amp;quot; said Ken Pucel, Polaris Industries&amp;#39; executive vice president of operations, engineering and lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipped with state-of-the-art technologies, the plant will support several core processes including vehicle assembly, chassis and body painting, welding, fabrication and injection molding. At full capacity, the site will employ at least 1,700 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Polaris will break ground on the Huntsville facility in the first quarter of 2015, with completion slated for early in the second quarter of 2016. Production will begin shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda Opens New $35-million Facility in Ohio</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda recently opened a new $35-million, 160,000-square-foot facility in Marysville, Ohio, including a museum, technical development center and office space for Honda North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Honda Heritage Center offers a glimpse of the history and growth the company has achieved in Ohio and North America during the past 55 years. The new museum pays tribute to Honda&amp;#39;s unique tradition and highlights products and significant milestones in the company&amp;#39;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the Honda museum, the building is home to a new technical development center, which is focused on advancing the skills of engineers, equipment service technicians and production associates involved in auto production at Honda plants in Ohio and throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Tom Shoupe, chief operating officer and executive vice president of Honda of America Mfg. Inc., the technical development center is significant as Honda&amp;#39;s North American operations take on an even greater role in the development and production of global Honda models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Honda is committed to investing in its team of associates, and this new training center will allow our associates to continually develop their manufacturing skills so that they can lead the production of critical global models,&amp;quot; Shoupe said. &amp;quot;As we introduce more sophisticated technologies in our products and in our plants, we are working to ensure that our associates are equipped with the skills required for the manufacturing demands of the future. We view this investment in Honda people as critical to our future success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The technical development center features five dedicated classrooms and includes robotic manufacturing cells designed to give technicians more hands-on experience. The curriculum provides instruction in basic fundamentals such as fluid power, maintenance math and frequency drives as well as advanced training for specialized areas, such as die molds and machining.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota to Expand Michigan Facilities</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota recently announced that it is planning another expansion of its Southeast Michigan research and development campuses. This marks the third time in just over a year that Toyota has announced plans to increase employment and investment in Michigan. The announcement features a total investment of $126 million for the expansion of Toyota&amp;#39;s powertrain operations at its Ann Arbor campus and the consolidation of vehicle development operations at a new facility on its York Township campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both vehicle development and powertrain functions will become centralized in Michigan, increasing their scope, responsibility and decision-making ability while providing improved communication and access to the company&amp;#39;s direct procurement division. Approximately 85 jobs will relocate to Michigan from California by the end of 2016 as a part of the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In late 2013, Toyota announced a $28-million expansion of its Ann Arbor operations, and earlier this year the company announced the addition of 250 direct procurement and supplier engineering development positions currently based in Erlanger, Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Centralizing our vehicle development and powertrain functions here in Michigan is beneficial for our decision-making process and allows us to better respond to changes in the marketplace while improving the speed at which we can offer technology advances to customers,&amp;quot; said Ed Mantey, senior vice president at the Toyota Technical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In April 2014, Toyota announced that it would establish new headquarters in North Dallas (Plano), Texas, for its North American operations as part of a series of moves designed to better serve customers and position the company for sustainable, long-term growth. This strategy includes establishing a new North American headquarters in Plano, Texas; expanding the Toyota Technical Center facilities in Southeast Michigan to accommodate increased investment in its engineering and product development capabilities; and opening a production engineering facility at Toyota&amp;#39;s largest U.S. manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. The new facilities are expected to be completed by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tosaf USA to Open Manufacturing Plant in North Carolina</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Tosaf USA recently announced plans to locate its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Bessemer City, North Carolina. The new plant is expected to create 75 jobs in five years with an investment of approximately $13.1 million over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are excited about our entry into the U.S. market and about establishing our operations in North Carolina,&amp;quot; said Amos Megides, chairman of the board of Tosaf Compounds. &amp;quot;I personally appreciate North Carolina&amp;#39;s assistance in our search for the best location for our new facility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The parent company of Tosaf USA, Tosaf Compounds, is based in Israel and specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of advanced polymers and compounds. The company&amp;#39;s products are used by plastic molders and processors, serving a wide range of industries including automotive, medical, electrical and packaging. The Bessemer City facility will be its first entry into the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;That Tosaf USA would choose North Carolina for its first U.S. manufacturing plant says volumes about what we have to offer,&amp;quot; said North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. &amp;quot;Tosaf USA found hard-working employees, a great quality of life and the infrastructure needed to be successful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project was made possible in part by a performance-based grant from the One North Carolina Fund of up to $225,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>IAC Opens Expanded Manufacturing Facility in Alabama</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	International Automotive Components (IAC) recently opened its newly expanded manufacturing operation in Anniston, Alabama. The 126,000-square-foot expansion, which was constructed adjacent to the existing IAC manufacturing plant, increases IAC&amp;#39;s Anniston production capacity to approximately 262,000 square feet. The operation will also support the hiring of approximately 350 new associates, increasing the total workforce to more than 500 employees by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Upon the creation of IAC, we committed our customers to establish operations near their facilities around the world,&amp;quot; said IAC president and CEO Jim Kamsickas. &amp;quot;The establishment of this new state-of-the-art facility provides yet another example of IAC executing upon that commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expanded facility will employ numerous manufacturing processes to produce IAC&amp;#39;s full suite of vehicle components, including instrument panels, door panels, flooring, acoustics and other interior trim systems for customers such as Nissan, Honda, Hyundai/Kia, Mercedes and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expanded footprint is consistent with IAC&amp;#39;s operating model and strategic plan. Over the past 16 months, the company has established a new global headquarters in Luxembourg, a new Asian regional headquarters in Shanghai, China, and a new European headquarters in Dusseldorf, Germany. The company has also entered the South African market, opened new manufacturing facilities in India and China, and substantially increased capacity throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Australian Mill Sets Best Practice for Kimberly-Clark</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/12/10/067659d0-6c61-44ac-856a-e4e392b9f78f_industries-2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 383px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing benchmarks achieved by a rural South Australian factory are being shared and instituted across the world by global manufacturing giant Kimberly-Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Mount Gambier, the Millicent Mill produces 85,000 tons of tissue paper each year for the New Zealand and Australia markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent state-of-the art additions include a co-generation plant, improvement of wastewater quality and introduction of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), all of which have provided the necessary efficiency and productivity advances to compete successfully on the manufacturing world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is tough being a manufacturer in Australia at the moment,&amp;quot; said Millicent Mill manager Scott Whicker. &amp;quot;We have to be smarter and better than our local and global competitors given the cost of labor, energy and transport to get raw materials to the mill and finished product to market. Some of the things we have been doing here in Millicent are being copied by Kimberley-Clark factories around the world, providing best-practice outcomes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The $33-million co-generation plant uses clean gas to power a turbine engine and generate electricity for the entire factory. The plant replaced an aging gas-fired boiler, and now all of the mill&amp;#39;s steam requirements are provided by the exhaust heat of the turbine engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant has effectively taken the mill off the local electricity grid as it generates more than 90 percent of the mill&amp;#39;s electrical load. This has provided significant savings in energy costs as well as reduced the carbon footprint of the factory, eliminating 80,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The factory&amp;#39;s wastewater improvements were also recently lauded by the South Australian Environment Protection Authority, which stated the quality of water included a 95-percent reduction in phosphorus load and an 89-percent reduction in nitrogen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A $2.5-million investment in AGVs replaced the manned forklifts in the distribution center. They handle the task of shuffling more than 2,000 pallets per day in and out of the 26,000-pallet, high-rise automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) warehouse using rotating laser global positioning systems. On average, the mill dispatches around 26 B-double trucks of product each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While we have to look at our operations from a financial perspective, we also have a set of sustainability goals that we strive to meet,&amp;quot; Whicker said. &amp;quot;The new techniques we have employed at the Millicent Mill are setting new benchmarks and are being adopted or adapted for use in other Kimberly-Clark factories around the world. The efficiencies are something we aim to continuously improve on so we can stay ahead of the game and keep manufacturing here in South Australia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/vSNmNK8bt10" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Missouri Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Missouri increased over the past year, according to the 2015 Missouri Manufacturers Register, a manufacturers&amp;#39; database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports that Missouri manufacturers added 1,592 jobs from August 2013 to August 2014, its third straight year of gains, though less than the 1.3-percent national average gain as reported by the Labor Department for the same time period. The state is now home to 7,876 manufacturers employing 366,322 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturers in Missouri are making gains across a variety of sectors,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s stronghold in both the auto sector and food products industry, combined with its reasonable business costs and large labor pool, continue to draw investment and support industrial growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gains were led by the transportation equipment industry, which posted a 2.8-percent rise in employment over the year. It is expected to keep rising as General Motors expands its plant in Wentzville and Ford ramps up production at its Kansas City factory. In addition, GM supplier Janesville Acoustics announced an expansion of its facility in Warrensburg. The transportation equipment industry in Missouri currently employs 44,385 people, ranking it second in the state for industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The food products sector accounts for the most manufacturing jobs in Missouri, employing 51,943 workers, though jobs in that sector were unchanged over the year. Industrial machinery and equipment posted a 1-percent loss and currently ranks third with 41,883 jobs. Other sectors adding jobs included chemicals, textiles/apparel, instruments/related products and fabricated metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment losses were recorded in electronics, following Energizer&amp;#39;s closure of its Maryville factory, and printing/publishing, after RR Donnelly closed its printing plant in Jefferson City. Losses were also reported in primary metals, paper products and furniture/fixtures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	St. Louis remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for industrial employment with 80,757 workers. Kansas City was second with 45,363 jobs, while Springfield ranked third with 16,687 industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Michelin Opens Tire Manufacturing Plant in South Carolina</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/11/25/be81a611-c4e9-424f-87de-6c57d403cded_michelin-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 216px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Michelin recently opened its newest manufacturing plant in Piedmont, South Carolina, which will produce the Tweel airless radial tire for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new 135,000-square-foot facility represents the company&amp;#39;s 10th manufacturing plant in South Carolina and the 16th in the United States. Michelin will invest approximately $50 million in the new facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant will allow the company to boost output of its Tweel SSL skid-steer tires and begin production of the new Tweel TURFTM as original equipment for John Deere to equip its ZTRAKTM 900 Series line-up of zero-turn commercial mowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unlike conventional tires, the Tweel has no air. The non-pneumatic tire features a rigid hub connected to a shear beam by means of flexible, deformable polyurethane spokes, all functioning as a single unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Tweel being built here in South Carolina is yet another dramatic example of Michelin&amp;#39;s long-standing commitment to breakthrough innovation,&amp;quot; said Pete Selleck, Michelin North America chairman and president. &amp;quot;The Tweel concept was born at Michelin Americas Research Company in Greenville, South Carolina, one of Michelin&amp;#39;s three global technology centers, and now the Tweel will be manufactured right here in the Greenville area to satisfy a growing commercial market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lease or Loan? 10 Considerations When Acquiring Equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/11/19/9b77c057-ace3-4c16-a029-da21b8feae5f_lease-or-loan.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 305px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;As the economy continues to improve, more manufacturers are making capital investments to fuel their growth. When business owners and managers consider acquiring equipment, they often think of their payment option as a lease vs. buy decision. In any economic environment, when preserving owner or shareholder capital is an important goal, financing equipment through a lease or loan will enable your business to preserve its cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you finance equipment through a lease or loan, each has its advantages. In evaluating your options, it is important to look at each alternative to determine which will best balance usage, cash flow and your financial objectives. To help determine the most appropriate option, consider the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. How Long will the Equipment be Required?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally speaking, if the length of time the equipment is expected to be used is short term (36 months or less), leasing is likely the preferable option. Equipment expected to be used for longer than three years could be a candidate for either a lease or loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. What is the Monthly Budget?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As with any ongoing business expense, consider the monthly cost for a piece of equipment and how it fits into your budget. In general, leasing will provide lower monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Will the Equipment Become Obsolete?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Protection against obsolescence is one of the many benefits of equipment leasing, since the risk of obsolescence is assumed by the lessor. Certain lease financing programs allow for technology upgrades and/or replacements within the term of the lease contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Can the Equipment be Used for Other Projects?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, the equipment&amp;#39;s business objective is for it to be revenue-producing. If a piece of equipment has limited use within a specific contract and won&amp;#39;t be used for other projects, it&amp;#39;s not ideal for it to be idle while you continue to make payments on it. It makes sense to stop the equipment expense when the income from it ceases, which you can do with a lease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. How Much Cash is Required Upfront?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leasing can usually provide 100-percent financing of the equipment cost as well as the costs for transportation, delivery, installation setup, testing and training, and other deferred costs (e.g., sales tax). Loans usually require a down payment and don&amp;#39;t include the other cost benefits. Ask how much of a down payment is needed and assess the availability and desirability of allocating company capital for the down payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Who Receives the Tax Benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tax treatment of the financing arrangement is an important consideration in choosing between a lease and a loan. A loan provides you with the depreciation tax benefit. With a lease, the lessor owns the equipment and realizes the tax benefit, which is usually reflected in a lower monthly rent payment for the organization as well as the ability to expense the payment. In many instances, if your business cannot use the tax benefit, it makes more sense to lease than to purchase through a loan because you can trade the depreciation to the lessor in exchange for better cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. How Will a Working-Capital Facility be Impacted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many businesses have an aggregate line of credit through a bank that they can use for inventory purchases, improvements and other capital expenditures. Depending on the lending covenants, it is often possible, as well as preferable, to preserve your bank working capital by leasing equipment through an equipment finance provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	8. How Flexible are the Financing Terms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lease can provide greater flexibility, since it can be structured for a variety of contingencies. With a loan, flexibility is subject to the lender&amp;#39;s rules. If your business has continuing use for the equipment when the lease ends, extended rentals, purchase options, trade-ups and return options are available. The lease term allows your business to match all expenses to the term of the equipment&amp;#39;s use, including income tax expense, book expense and cash expense. Most importantly, the expense stops when the equipment is no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	9. Is Additional Equipment Anticipated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If your business is planning for growth, you can enter into a master lease that will allow you to acquire multiple pieces of equipment under a number of schedules with the same basic terms and conditions. This provides greater convenience and flexibility than a conditional loan contract, which must be renegotiated for additional equipment acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	10. Who can Help Determine the Best Option?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When making the decision between a lease and a loan, it is recommended that you consult with your accounting professional as well as draw on the resources of your equipment financing provider to enable you to secure the best possible terms for your lease and/or loan.

            <title>Survey Shows Business Trending Upward for Manufacturers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	North America&amp;#39;s manufacturing sector is on an upward trajectory according to ThomasNet&amp;#39;s latest Industry Market Barometer (IMB) research. However, a shortage of young talent, compounded by Baby Boomers&amp;#39; negative perceptions about Millennials, could impact its continued expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The annual survey of nearly 500 product and custom manufacturers shows continued growth for this sector. Companies are hiring, increasing production capacity, and investing for more growth to come. More than half (58 percent) grew in 2013, and 63 percent expect even more gains by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Positive indicators are everywhere. Manufacturers are getting more business from their existing markets, and their average account values are rising. Nearly eight out of 10 (76 percent) are now selling overseas, and one-third expect that business to increase. In anticipation of what&amp;#39;s ahead, they are investing in capital equipment, optimizing operations, upgrading their facilities and retraining their people. More than half (52 percent) expect to add staff in the next several months, up from the 42 percent who planned to hire last year. Respondents&amp;#39; companies are looking for trained, experienced people &amp;mdash; manufacturing/production management, line workers, skilled trade workers and engineers &amp;mdash; to keep up with current and future demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A deeper look under the hood raises questions about whether the manufacturing industry can continue its current momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;For the industry to sustain its steady climb, all the fundamentals need to be in place, and one of them is missing &amp;mdash; a robust pipeline of talent,&amp;quot; said Mark Holst-Knudsen, president of ThomasNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last year&amp;#39;s IMB called attention to the &amp;quot;ticking biological clock&amp;quot; in manufacturing &amp;mdash; the disruption that&amp;#39;s coming as Baby Boomers leave the workforce without people primed to replace them. This year&amp;#39;s survey depicts the &amp;quot;ticking&amp;quot; turning to an alarm. Nearly half of this year&amp;#39;s respondents (49 percent) are 55 and older. Moreover, 38 percent plan to retire in one to 10 years, and most (65 percent) lack any succession plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One solution is in plain sight &amp;mdash; the Millennial generation (ages 18 to 32), who can take the time to learn the business before their predecessors retire. Yet most manufacturers (62 percent) say Millennials represent a small fraction of their workforce, and eight out of 10 (81 percent) have no explicit plans to increase those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, companies are making headway in the area of apprenticeships, which provide opportunities to bring in entry-level employees and career changers. For manufacturers where these programs are applicable, 51 percent now have them in place, and 23 percent plan to do so. They are teaching apprentices trades such as machining, CNC milling and turning, and welding while increasing their staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We need new talent everywhere &amp;mdash; on the plant floor, in the field and in management &amp;mdash; and getting young people to look at manufacturing isn&amp;#39;t easy,&amp;quot; said Karen Norheim of American Crane and Equipment Corporation. &amp;quot;To ensure our company&amp;#39;s success, our employees have become brand ambassadors for manufacturing. We&amp;#39;re bringing our children to our plants, looking at new internship programs, and reaching out to local colleges and trade schools. By making a local footprint, we&amp;#39;re helping to address a national problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s data shows that the manufacturing industry increasingly aligns with Millennials&amp;#39; value systems and technology expertise. The research demonstrates that Millennials have an opportunity to make a social impact working with sustainable and green technologies, solar energy, and wind power. In addition, respondents cite innovations in design and manufacturing software, automation/robotics, and 3-D printing as intrinsic to today&amp;#39;s jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But 46 percent of respondents say that a larger issue is at work &amp;mdash; younger people still perceive manufacturing as &amp;quot;blue collar&amp;quot; work. Baby Boomers&amp;rsquo; perceptions of Millennials also exacerbate the challenge, as 43 percent of respondents believe that this generation lacks the work ethic and discipline to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;At a time when the American manufacturing sector is poised for a comeback, the talent shortage is the elephant in the room that could impede progress,&amp;quot; said Holst-Knudsen. &amp;quot;It will take the concerted effort of every manufacturer to reach across generational lines and bring in the people who are critical to the industry&amp;#39;s continued success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Owens Corning to Build North Carolina Plant for Bio-based Products</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Owens Corning recently announced that it will build a new advanced technology facility in Gastonia, North Carolina, to help meet demand for its bio-based products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant&amp;#39;s state-of-the-art equipment will add manufacturing flexibility to produce different widths of the company&amp;#39;s new Sustaina non-woven glass-fiber fabric, which should enable more customers to use the product in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Sustaina solution uses a bio-based binder system with high-tensile-strength performance. Sustaina fabric is designed for use in residential and commercial building applications such as cushioned vinyl flooring, ceiling backings and insulation facers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant will be able to run 4-meter widths of Sustaina fabric rather than the narrower width currently produced on existing assets. The flexibility to produce the wider veil should help generate better yields and less waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Building a new site is a great opportunity for us to install the newest, most advanced manufacturing technology,&amp;quot; said Steven Vermeulen, vice president and managing director for Owens Corning. &amp;quot;With our Gastonia plant, we&amp;#39;ll be able to meet the growing demand for Sustaina non-wovens. It&amp;#39;s a way we can help our customers move toward their environmental objectives while also improving their performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Connecticut Manufacturing Jobs Decline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment in Connecticut declined slightly over the past year, according to the 2015 Connecticut Manufacturers Register, a manufacturers&amp;#39; database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports that Connecticut lost 1,894 manufacturing jobs from June 2013 to June 2014 and is one of the few states for which a loss was reported in the past year. The state is now home to 5,242 manufacturers employing 208,208 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A five-year analysis of MNI data shows industrial jobs in Connecticut have fallen 6.2 percent since June 2009, while government statistics reveal manufacturing employment in the United States overall climbed 3.4 percent during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;High business costs and global competition have made it difficult for Connecticut manufacturers to climb back from the recession,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;However, its educated workforce and investment in worker training programs continue to be a draw for new businesses, particularly those focused on technology and innovation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations announcing closures in Connecticut included a Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics plant in Brookfield and a Northrop Grumman military radar site in Norwalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the companies announcing expansions over the year included Memry Corporation in Bethel, Neeltran Inc. in New Milford, Bakery on Main in East Hartford and BYK USA in Wallingford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Transportation equipment remains the state&amp;#39;s largest sector by employment with 34,154 jobs. Second-ranked fabricated metals accounts for 26,007 jobs, while industrial machinery ranks third with 25,903 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional industries in Connecticut cutting jobs included instruments/related products, stone/clay/glass, lumber/wood, printing/publishing and primary metals. Gains were reported in furniture/fixtures, food products and paper products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Stratford remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for industrial employment with 9,346 workers. Bristol was second with 8,658 jobs, while North Haven ranked third with 7,866 industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Manufacturers' Survey Reveals Economic Confidence</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent survey of U.S. industrial manufacturing companies indicated continued optimism about revenues and employment despite concerns about rising costs and a lack of qualified workers. The survey, which was conducted by Prime Advantage, revealed financial projections and top concerns of more than 750 small and midsized manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the survey showed that 49 percent of respondents expect revenues to increase in the second half of 2014 compared to the first half. Of these, 22 percent anticipate revenue growth will be more than 10 percent greater this year than last year, while 28 percent project revenue growth of up to 10 percent. Survey respondents reported that improved customer demand will fuel this predicted revenue increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capital expenditures are also expected to increase in the second half of 2014 for 42 percent of the midsized manufacturing companies in the group, an increase of 12 percent from 2013&amp;#39;s survey projections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Employment up in Manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Half of all survey respondents are predicting new hires for their small and midsized manufacturing operations in the next six months, an increase of 3 percent from the 2013 survey. Forty-nine percent predict that hiring will match first half levels, with only 1 percent anticipating layoffs by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Top Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Procurement professionals continue to cite the cost of raw materials as their top purchasing concern for the second half of 2014. Processes and efficiencies within purchasing were the second greatest purchasing concern, followed by the cost of baseline materials for components, such as oil and gas. When asked to identify the top three cost pressures for the last half of 2014, respondents cited raw materials, health-care costs and labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Quality Workforce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey respondents identified the top barriers to business growth over the next 12 months as being a lack of qualified workers (53 percent), legislative and regulatory pressures (45 percent), and foreign competition (30 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our members are making some of the highest projections for the next six months that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen,&amp;quot; said Louise O&amp;#39;Sullivan, founder, president and CEO of Prime Advantage. &amp;quot;Revenue forecasts, capital expenditure plans and labor force expectations are all at record levels. Our members are becoming more energy efficient, more sustainable and more technologically advanced. This is all a true testament to the invaluable supply chain partnerships and resources created through our group&amp;#39;s collaboration as we march in unison to make an everlasting impact in the world of manufacturing that will be built upon for generations to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In August 2014, Prime Advantage surveyed purchasing executives and professionals from companies with annual revenues ranging between $10 million and $4 billion, of which the majority ranges between $20 million and $500 million. The survey received 82 responses from top professionals representing U.S.-based manufacturers in more than 25 different industries, including commercial food-service equipment, packaging, truck and trailer, material handling, food processing and construction equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>6 Ways to Improve Manufacturing Quality and Reduce Recalls</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/10/8/25cc8a3a-320c-4906-b4cd-8e1f1c4b685a_honda_inspect2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 400px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The prevalence of recalls in recent years has contributed to a significant, yet unnecessary expense for manufacturers and an added burden on single-source suppliers. In the first six months of 2014, U.S. automakers hit a record high with the total number of recalls reaching 39.85 million vehicles. In the past five years, 12 million vehicles have been recalled for a faulty airbag inflator, affecting nearly every major automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automobiles are more complex than ever, with systems that continue to try to do more for the driver. But with complexity comes higher risk for failure. Automotive manufacturers must take steps to mitigate these failures through collaboration and the use of advanced technologies. The ability to easily move information and attain real-time visibility into the supply chain and its manufacturing and quality processes is crucial in order to continue producing high-quality and safe vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are six tips to help the automotive industry improve quality and reduce recalls across the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Create a Culture of Quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Abnormalities in parts or inefficiencies in manufacturing processes exist on any plant floor, but operators may hesitate to point them out for fear it will reflect poorly on the quality of their work. Instead, quality departments and executive management should create a culture where suggestions for improvements &amp;mdash; large or small &amp;mdash; are welcomed and praised. This not only will encourage employees to offer suggestions but also ultimately lead to improved manufacturing and quality based on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Work with Suppliers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Relationships between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers have continued to change drastically, shifting from one manufacturer juggling multiple suppliers to a single supplier supporting multiple manufacturers. Even though this is a more efficient business model for manufacturers, it creates a scenario where issues with a single supplier affect multiple manufacturers and multiple part lines. Working closely with suppliers enables manufacturers to understand the supplier&amp;rsquo;s internal processes and offer ways to improve the quality of the component parts so they meet the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Use Technology to Connect the Supply Chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a global supply chain, it becomes increasingly difficult to know what is happening at each facility or supplier. Utilizing leading technologies such as the cloud or mobile devices helps to connect the supply chain, making it possible for operators and inspectors within a manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s facility or the supplier to input data from anywhere using a mobile device. The data populate a centralized database for personnel to review and analyze while sending real-time notifications to management even when they are offsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Demand More than an Inspection Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traditionally, manufacturers had to rely on a paper report and the word of their suppliers that the parts received met the OEM&amp;rsquo;s high-quality standards. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to trust this process. Manufacturers must have visibility into supplier operations to understand what&amp;rsquo;s occurring within the manufacturing processes, ensuring appropriate testing is being conducted and confirming the results meet the OEM&amp;rsquo;s standards. Real-time visibility created through cloud-based quality systems offers a complete view of supplier operations, removing the need to re-inspect incoming parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Leverage Manufacturing Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data gathered in-process can offer a second tier of information or manufacturing intelligence that can be used to increase efficiency and quality across the enterprise and supply chain. Utilizing advanced data analysis software, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to compare sites or suppliers, identifying areas for improvement. If one facility is running an identical process significantly more efficiently than another, the information could be shared with the second site to enable process improvement. Extending this learning opportunity across a manufacturing environment helps to increase overall effectiveness and improve variation across operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Drill Down through Data to Reduce Warranty Claims and Recalls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing intelligence enables the enterprise to drill down through manufacturing data from within the OEM business and the supply chain in order to identify when, where and how defective parts were made. If a product was returned within the warranty period because of a defective part, quality software can be used to identify whether the return was due to a supplier or material inconsistency. With the source of the issue identified, enterprises can put measures in place to prevent the same issue in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/6m-YUqE05Rg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ford to Install New LED Lighting at Manufacturing Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. recently announced that it will invest more than $25 million to install light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at manufacturing facilities across the globe. The new lights will save energy and money while improving safety and lighting quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 25,000 new LED fixtures will replace traditional high-intensity discharge and fluorescent lights, and are expected to reduce Ford&amp;#39;s energy use at manufacturing facilities by 56 million kilowatt-hours annually, which equates to a reduction of almost 70 percent in lighting energy consumption. Annual energy costs are expected to be reduced by approximately $7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The need for maintenance will also diminish, as LED lighting has a 15-year life expectancy. Studies show LED light output remains steady at less than 1-percent degradation per year over the life of the equipment, while fluorescent and high-intensity-discharge (HID) fixtures require re-lamping in as little as two years. LED lights improve safety by eliminating hazardous materials in fixtures and lowering fire risks. At the same time, the technology provides a brighter work area, better uniformity and improved color perception, resulting in a better quality of light for plant employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Moving to LED gives us impressive efficiency improvement,&amp;quot; said George Andraos, director of energy and sustainability at Ford Land. &amp;quot;Ford worked closely with its scientists and suppliers to investigate and closely follow the rapid development of LED lighting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work began at the Dearborn truck plant late last month to replace worn and outdated overhead lighting. The LED replacement program will continue through the year at 17 other Ford manufacturing facilities across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Magneti Marelli Opens Michigan Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/9/30/de6ab372-d4ca-4b0f-a022-76c7b360aa08_Magneti Marelli.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 181px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Magneti Marelli Holding USA recently opened a new exhaust-system manufacturing plant in Independence Township, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant should strengthen Magneti Marelli&amp;#39;s position in North America, adding to its competencies that include automotive lighting, powertrain, electronic systems, suspension systems, aftermarket and motorsport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The inauguration of the Independence Township plant is a significant milestone for Magneti Marelli,&amp;quot; said Stephane Vedie, Magneti Marelli Holding USA president and CEO. &amp;quot;With the addition of the exhaust plant, each of the company&amp;#39;s business lines is now represented in North America, providing an expanding footprint to serve our customers here and around the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 100,000-plus-square-foot plant located in suburban Detroit is the first Michigan manufacturing facility for Magneti Marelli, whose North American headquarters is in nearby Auburn Hills. Employing 75 people, the plant will manufacture hot-end exhaust manifolds integrated with catalytic converters. The facility is expected to reach a production capacity of approximately 300,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All manufacturing operations will be performed onsite, including forming of the canister in which catalyst materials are inserted and robotic welding of the various components to create the finished product. The plant&amp;rsquo;s first important project is related to Fiat Chrysler platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kansas Gains Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment in Kansas posted a slight gain over the past year, according to the 2014 Kansas Manufacturers Directory, a manufacturers&amp;#39; database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Kansas added 824 manufacturing jobs from April 2013 to April 2014 and is now home to 4,450 manufacturers employing 217,189 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Although the general downturn in the aviation industry has hurt Kansas, the state remains a great place to do business,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;Its low business costs and abundant natural resources continue to lure a variety of new manufacturers to the state, such as the Mars chocolate plant that recently opened in Topeka.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state&amp;#39;s three largest industrial sectors by employment saw little to no change in the number of jobs during the survey period. Employment levels in the transportation equipment industry were virtually unchanged, with the sector accounting for 46,159 jobs, though that figure is slated to drop as Boeing winds down operations at its Wichita plant. Employment in food products declined a half percent, with the sector employing 33,258, while industrial machinery accounts for 27,941 jobs, a half percent higher than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several manufacturing companies in Kansas announced expansions over the year including a General Motors assembly plant in Kansas City, LMV Automotive in Liberty, Catalyst Artificial Lift in Iola and Unilever&amp;#39;s margarine plant in Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industries in Kansas reporting losses included lumber/wood, printing/publishing, stone/clay/glass, furniture/fixtures and electronics. Gains were reported in chemicals, rubber/plastics and instruments/related products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Major industrial closures in Kansas included a Bimbo Bakery facility in Wichita and a Hallmark production plant in Topeka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wichita remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 59,100 workers, followed by Kansas City with 13,155 jobs and Lenexa with 10,613 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Siemens Agrees to Buy Dresser-Rand for $7.6 Billion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dresser-Rand recently announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Siemens under which Siemens will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dresser-Rand common stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $7.6 billion, including the assumption of debt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Siemens intends to operate Dresser-Rand as the company&amp;#39;s oil and gas business, retaining the Dresser-Rand brand name and its executive leadership team. In addition, Siemens intends to maintain a significant presence in Houston, which will be the Siemens headquarters for its oil and gas business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As the premium brand in the global energy infrastructure markets, Dresser-Rand is a perfect fit for the Siemens portfolio,&amp;quot; said Joe Kaeser, president and CEO of Siemens AG. &amp;quot;The combined activities will create a world-class provider for the growing oil and gas markets. With this, Dresser-Rand will become &amp;#39;the oil and gas&amp;#39; company within Siemens and fit right into our Siemens Vision 2020.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2015 and is subject to Dresser-Rand shareholder approval, regulatory approval in the United States, Europe and certain other jurisdictions, and other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Siemens has committed to take all necessary steps from a regulatory perspective to ensure that the transaction will be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are excited about the opportunity to continue on our journey to become the premier supplier of high-speed rotating equipment and solutions for this industry and believe that the enhancements in offerings available to us in the form of the existing products and services from the Siemens group will serve as an accelerator for technological innovation, profitable growth and extended opportunities for our employees and the communities around the globe in which we operate,&amp;quot; said Vincent R. Volpe Jr., Dresser-Rand&amp;#39;s president and CEO. &amp;quot;Simply stated, we see this as a unique opportunity to better serve our clients, employees and shareholders and are pleased to have Dresser-Rand placed in the central role for Siemens as it develops its position in oil and gas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Study Reveals Federal Regulations Cost U.S. Economy $2 Trillion Annually</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Complying with federal regulations costs Americans $2.028 trillion in lost economic growth annually, or roughly 12 percent of the total gross domestic product that could be invested back into U.S. businesses, according to a new study commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study, which was conducted by economists Nicole and W. Mark Crain, concluded that manufacturing businesses face a disproportionate share of the burden, or $19,564 per employee per year, which is nearly double what the average U.S. business pays to comply with federal rules. Small manufacturers pay more than three times as much as the average U.S. firm. That is $34,671 per employee per year that small manufacturers could use to grow their businesses and create jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturers have long cited more and more complex regulations as a barrier to their growth, and today we have new data demonstrating the true burdens shouldered by manufacturers throughout the supply chain, particularly the smallest firms, in complying with growing federal mandates,&amp;quot; said NAM president and CEO Jay Timmons. &amp;quot;Manufacturers rely on a stable, balanced and commonsense regulatory environment to create jobs and fuel economic growth. With growing regulatory compliance burdens, policymakers should be alarmed that our nation&amp;rsquo;s smallest manufacturers are being put at a competitive disadvantage within the global economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The newly released NAM study builds on previous studies conducted for the U.S. Small Business Administration&amp;rsquo;s Office of Advocacy. This study updates previous estimates of the cost to comply with federal regulations using new data sources and incorporates the findings of an extensive survey of NAM members that validate conclusions reached in the economic analysis. For instance, the survey shows that manufacturers would invest more in their businesses and in their people if compliance costs were lessened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our data continue to show that small businesses and manufacturers bear a disproportionate share of compliance costs,&amp;quot; said Nicole Crain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Overall, we hope that this analysis helps policymakers as they contemplate additional regulatory proposals,&amp;quot; added W. Mark Crain. &amp;quot;Small businesses and manufacturers most frequently identified regulatory issues as the top business challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These costs don&amp;#39;t even include the more significant regulations heading our way, such as a new ozone standard from the Environmental Protection Agency that would be the most expensive regulation in U.S. history,&amp;quot; said Timmons. &amp;quot;These and other regulations mean an even larger burden on our country&amp;rsquo;s small manufacturers. Now is the time to return clear-eyed economic analysis to the policy process and ease the burden on job creators across the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>BorgWarner to Expand Illinois Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/9/3/486d3436-72ad-4124-9247-ced256ccd2ec_borgwarnerplant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 160px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;BorgWarner recently announced plans to invest $9.4 million in its plant in Dixon, Ill., over the next three years. The expanded production capacity will allow the company to supply customers with environmentally friendly technologies, including exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers, tubes and thermostats to help reduce emissions and improve fuel economy for passenger cars and on- and off-road commercial diesel vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BorgWarner expects to create 40 new jobs, including opportunities in the areas of manufacturing and product engineering, supplier quality, supply chain, and technical and quality support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are pleased to support the local economy with expanded operations in Dixon and appreciate the encouragement we have received from both the city of Dixon and the state of Illinois,&amp;quot; said plant manager Paddy Lange. &amp;quot;Dixon&amp;#39;s infrastructure gives us the ability to meet growing customer demand in North America, which is likely to increase within the next few years.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a total area of 135,000 square feet and a current workforce of 210, the Dixon plant is an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Voluntary Protection Program (OSHA VPP) site and is certified in ISO TS 16949 quality standards. In 2013, the plant received a BorgWarner Global Safety Award for achieving a minimum number of work-related injuries or illnesses over a five-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Arizona Manufacturing Jobs Decline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment in Arizona declined over the past year, according to the 2014 Arizona Manufacturers Directory, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports that Arizona lost 499 manufacturing jobs from April 2013 to April 2014 and is now home to 5,202 manufacturers employing 216,094 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Defense department cuts and global competition, particularly in the solar/wind industries, have affected many manufacturing companies in Arizona,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;However, given its favorable regulatory environment and its skilled labor pool, the state remains a top candidate for major projects such as Tesla&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;gigafactory.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations announcing closures included Suntech&amp;#39;s solar panel facility in Goodyear, Southwest Windpower&amp;#39;s Flagstaff wind turbine plant and a PaperWorks Industries folding carton plant in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing sectors in Arizona reporting losses included paper products, stone/clay/glass, furniture/fixtures, lumber/wood and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Report Recommends New Approach to Manufacturing's Youth Outreach and Training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to a new report from Hope Street Group, immediate changes in career education and training are needed to ensure that the U.S. manufacturing industry can meet its future hiring needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report found that American youth are getting fewer opportunities to experience technical trades directly. This problem is exacerbated by systemic challenges that prevent educators and employers from creating opportunities to expose young people to manufacturing careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report highlights student, educator and employer perspectives into this issue, along with strategies for manufacturing employers to collaborate with educators on youth outreach and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One observation from the report&amp;#39;s findings was that youth frequently develop misconceptions about manufacturing early on because they have little direct exposure to manufacturing in their daily lives. They are often unaware, uninterested or unprepared for jobs available in their regions and lack comprehensive knowledge of the rapid changes the U.S. manufacturing sector has undergone in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those aiming to assist students in the career exploration process also expressed concern over significant time and resource barriers. Teachers generally felt they lacked the time and guidance to cover career education in the classroom. Manufacturing employers cited financial difficulties and a lack of coordination with other local employers and educators as major obstacles to success. Only 29 percent of business leaders currently report any meaningful collaboration with higher education institutions, according to a poll conducted by Gallup and Lumina Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The problem is indicative of a growing disconnect between employer needs and educational training focus, and solving it will require finding new ways to encourage alignment,&amp;quot; said Hope Street Group president and CEO Martin Scaglione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hope Street Group suggests that manufacturing employers take an active role in addressing this knowledge gap by playing a larger role in exposing students to manufacturing and other skilled careers through encouraging manufacturing education in the classroom, providing direct contact with technical trades and creating online educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Funded by Alcoa Foundation, the &amp;quot;Missing Makers: How to Rebuild America&amp;#39;s Manufacturing Workforce&amp;quot; report also includes recommendations for fostering collaboration between local manufacturers and educators in their respective regions, helping to overcome financial and coordination barriers that have hindered effective outreach. The report is intended to further inform and empower the numerous stakeholders involved in addressing this issue, many of whom are already working on innovative efforts to improve education to employment pathways in and beyond manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturing jobs of the future will require all workers to continually upgrade and diversify their skills,&amp;quot; said Esra Ozer, president of Alcoa Foundation. &amp;quot;We must move beyond fragmented training solutions and take a broader, more holistic view of what individuals need to achieve self-sufficiency in an increasingly complex working world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>CNH Industrial to Increase Production at Iowa Plant in 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CNH Industrial recently announced that it will be investing $24 million to expand production at its manufacturing plant in Burlington, Iowa, with the addition of the company&amp;#39;s crawler dozer production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This expansion will create approximately 50 full-time jobs. Preparations will begin later this year, and production on the new line is expected to start in the second half of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With the growing demand for quality construction equipment, we are pleased to announce that production in Burlington, Iowa, will be expanded,&amp;quot; said Bret Lieberman, CNH Industrial vice president of manufacturing. &amp;quot;We look forward to creating a state-of-the-art production line that will continue CNH Industrial&amp;#39;s tradition of providing high-performing equipment to the construction industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The machines are currently produced at the Calhoun, Ga., plant, which will close in the third quarter of 2015 as the company adjusts its construction operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moving the production line to Iowa is part of CNH Industrial&amp;#39;s long-term strategy to optimize its manufacturing footprint and achieve a lean, flexible industrial operation. The production transfer is contingent upon completion and approval of all state and local incentives and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The production facilities will include new dedicated paint and assembly lines as well as welding and computer numerical control (CNC) machining equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Burlington plant, which has manufactured equipment for CNH Industrial&amp;#39;s brands since 1937, is home to more than 600 employees. In addition to Case construction equipment, the plant&amp;#39;s employees produce agricultural equipment for the company&amp;#39;s Case IH and New Holland brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CNH Industrial has 12 manufacturing plants, 12 research and development centers, and a workforce of 10,000 people in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ormet Plant May Be Repurposed</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/7/1eca6df1-62e4-4cc1-a5f8-ba7563d2cdb3_Ormet Aireal.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 273px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Niagara Worldwide LLC is currently in talks to repurpose the 1,700-acre site of the former Ormet Plant in Hannibal, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are talking to the world,&amp;quot; said Eric Spirtas, president of Niagara Worldwide and Hannibal Development Partners. &amp;quot;In an effort to determine global interest in this specialized facility, we are communicating with every aluminum-related business group worldwide to share with them what sets here in Hannibal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spirtas explained that while there is not a simple switch to throw that begins the daily output of 1.6 million pounds of aluminum, there is a path to reusing the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have been contacted to consider specific operations like a cold pour process in the current cast house that would use furnaces to melt the aluminum for remolding stock, while another team has spoken to us about an entire smelting reuse,&amp;quot; Spirtas added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To even consider a resurrection of the historic smelter and its system, which remains fully intact today, a completely integrated plan with new power, government backing and community support would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spirtas also mentioned a possibly larger site opportunity unrelated to the aluminum market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are in negotiations with three very large oil and gas service providers that work hand-in-hand with the oil drilling, gas processing and fuel transportation markets now imbedded in this region due to the Utica and Marcellus shale exploration,&amp;quot; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If this effort is successful, there could be multiple uses for the 12 miles of rail, 50-barge docking port and pneumatic loading and unloading systems at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Energy Panel Structures Adds N.Y. Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/29/6e7890ac-7bf3-4ce6-a9b9-3a45d4bb59f7_eps-plant.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 222px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Energy Panel Structures (EPS) recently added a new structural insulated panels (SIP) manufacturing plant at its Fingerlakes Construction facility in Clyde, N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant is approximately 10,000 square feet and includes a state-of-the-art automated CNC machine. Additional equipment will be used for laminating, cutting and prefabbing the panels. The plant is expected to produce 1.5 million square feet of panels annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have been manufacturing SIPs at our Iowa location for over 20 years,&amp;quot; said Chris Spaeth, vice president of sales for EPS. &amp;quot;We can now provide SIPs from the New York facility to accommodate our growing customer base in the New England and eastern states. SIPs are recognized for their high performance as a building package for those customers who want an energy-efficient home, ag or commercial building.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Structural insulated panels are known for their energy efficiency and are a proven building product. The panels consist of an insulating foam core sandwiched between oriented strand board (OSB). The panels are manufactured under factory-controlled conditions and can be fabricated to fit nearly any building design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with its Fingerlakes location, EPS has a corporate office in Graettinger, Iowa, and an additional manufacturing facility in Perryville, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cascades to Close Quebec Paper Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cascades Inc. recently announced that it will cease its Kraft paper manufacturing activities at the East Angus plant in Quebec because of unfavorable market conditions and the failure of discussions concerning the plant&amp;#39;s transfer and turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With the arrival of new competitors that convert newsprint paper machines to produce Kraft paper, and the ongoing weakening of market conditions for our products, the East Angus plant has not managed to maintain a competitive edge in the market despite significant investments and serious recovery efforts,&amp;quot; explained Luc Langevin, president and chief operating officer of Cascades Specialty Products Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By closing the plant, Cascades is withdrawing from the Kraft paper sector definitively. Approximately 175 employees will be affected by the closure, which will go into effect by Oct. 3, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Last November, we announced to employees our decision to withdraw from the industry,&amp;quot; added Langevin. &amp;quot;At the time, we offered them the plant debt-free. After several months of ongoing efforts on the part of buyer Gino L&amp;eacute;vesque, the Quebec government and Cascades to come up with a financial package, the project was abandoned because of a lack of new investors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To assist the employees affected by the shutdown, Cascades will help relocate personnel to other units. The company will also work with the union and local government to reduce the impact on workers and the community. The announcement does not concern the coated boxboard manufacturing plant located in East Angus.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nebraska Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the third year in a row, industrial employment in Nebraska posted a gain, according to the 2014 Nebraska Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Nebraska gained 1,731 manufacturing jobs from July 2012 to July 2013 and is now home to 2,765 manufacturers employing 123,505 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Nebraska ranks as a great place to do business,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state continues to regain the industrial employment lost during the recession and at a quicker pace than many other states thanks to its friendly business environment, low taxes and abundant natural resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the state included biotech giant Monsanto&amp;#39;s announcement of its plans to expand a seed processing plant in Waco and the recent news that the previously shuttered Local Pride kosher meat-processing plant in Gordon will be reopened by Open Range Beef. In addition, pet medicine maker Zoetis announced an expansion of its plant in Lincoln. AGP will also expand a soybean processing plant in Hastings, while Japanese electrical equipment maker Morio Denki recently announced plans to open its first U.S. operations in Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Food products manufacturing accounts for the most industrial employment in the state with 38,659 jobs, followed by industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing with 12,372 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nebraska&amp;#39;s industrial employment gains were spread out across most sectors including textiles/apparel, stone/clay/glass, primary metals, electronics, transportation equipment and chemicals. Losses were seen in fabricated metals, lumber/wood and instruments/related products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations announcing closures included Leprino Foods, which plans to close a cheese plant in Ravenna and transfer production to another plant in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Omaha remains Nebraska&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 33,558 industrial jobs. Lincoln was second with 17,487 jobs, followed by Grand Island with 8,067 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Baldor Plant Chosen as Top Workplace </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldor Electric Co. was recently named a 2014 top workplace by the &lt;em&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. Top workplaces were selected based on employee feedback provided during a confidential survey conducted by Workplace Dynamics LLP.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldor metal-stamping plant produces stamped parts for five motor manufacturing plants in the United States. Each year the plant generates more than 700 million pieces of steel laminations. The 250 employees in the St. Louis plant also produce more than 5 million motor parts per year, including bases, fans, fan covers, capacitor boxes and retainer rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;During the survey, our employees told us they value our company&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;no layoff&amp;#39; strategy, sharing in the company&amp;#39;s success through our profit-sharing plan and improving themselves through our tuition-reimbursement plan,&amp;quot; said Ron Tucker, Baldor&amp;#39;s chief executive officer and president. &amp;quot;Our employees are one of our most valuable assets. Investing in them has truly been a key part of our success, and we appreciate what they do for our customers and for each other.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A member of the ABB group, Baldor was founded in St. Louis in 1920 and has been at its current location since 1963. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Giti Tire recently announced plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Chester, S.C., to meet growing demand in North America. The $560-million facility is expected to generate 1,700 new jobs over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The new facility will combine a manufacturing plant and distribution center with total building area estimated to be 1.8 million square feet,&amp;quot; said Tom McNamara, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Giti Tire (USA) Ltd. &amp;quot;The first phase of production capacity is expected to be 5 million tires annually. Giti Tire plans to further increase production capacity in response to future market demand and conditions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant, which will produce passenger and light truck tires for the replacement and original equipment markets, will be built with a focus on maintaining a healthy balance with the environment and following Giti Tire&amp;#39;s green initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturers Look for Ways to Close the Gender Gap</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. manufacturing industry&amp;rsquo;s ongoing skills gap is affecting 80 percent of employers and is exacerbated by the underrepresentation of women, according to a new report from Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Challenges and opportunities to integrate more women into the manufacturing workforce are illustrated in the study, &amp;ldquo;Celebrating Success, Achievement and Potential of Women in Manufacturing: A Leadership View of Overcoming the Talent Crisis and Filling the Skills Gap.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Building upon the women in manufacturing research previously published by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte, senior executives representing automotive, aerospace and defense, process, and diversified manufacturing participated in an executive roundtable on Feb. 6, 2014. They discussed women in the manufacturing industry and initiatives to help close the gender gap, including how manufacturers can best attract, retain and advance talented women in the industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the roundtable, executives focused on changing the corporate culture in the industry and what manufacturers can do to create a strong employer brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While women make up approximately 50 percent of the labor force according to industry estimates, that number is only about 24 percent in the manufacturing labor force,&amp;quot; said Craig Giffi, vice chairman of Deloitte LLP. &amp;quot;Manufacturing executives have developed several effective strategies to help close the gender gap and, in turn, the skills gap.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing executives suggested several strategies to help close the gender gap, including integrating women into the corporate strategy to lead a strategic cultural change while ensuring men are equally involved and committed to the efforts; sharing leading practices and being proactive in providing resources to inform, educate and mentor; and using affinity groups to generate ideas, motivate peers and give/receive guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The skills shortage facing U.S. manufacturers is apparent, and the underrepresentation of women only contributes to the gap,&amp;quot; said Jennifer McNelly, president of the Manufacturing Institute. &amp;quot;We must empower each other as ambassadors of the industry so we can inspire the next generation of young women to pursue manufacturing careers and encourage current female talent within the industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Regal Beloit Closes Kentucky Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Regal Beloit Corp. recently informed employees at its locations in Mt. Sterling and Winchester, Ky., of its decision to cease operations at both facilities. This decision will affect approximately 200 employees. The products and processes located at these facilities will be transferred to other Regal and non-Regal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company, which has multiple manufacturing facilities that make various component parts and motors, believes that consolidating its operations will enable it to remain globally competitive, reduce variation between its manufacturing facilities and improve cycle times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regal will be meeting with the union to discuss the impact of this decision in compliance with the National Labor Relations Act. It is the company&amp;#39;s intention to provide a comprehensive benefits package for eligible employees affected by the plant closures. Regal also plans to help affected employees make a successful transition from their jobs to other work within Regal Beloit Corp. or in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Beloit, Wis., Regal Beloit Corp. is a leading manufacturer of electric motors, mechanical and electrical motion controls, and power generation products. The company has manufacturing, sales and service facilities throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Georgia-Pacific to Expand Plate Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/6/3/f708d367-6c06-420a-b841-953033d8196b_ga-pac-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 215px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Georgia-Pacific recently announced plans to invest nearly $40 million in new technology and equipment to expand its plate manufacturing capability at its Dixie facility in Fort Smith, Ark. Construction is already in progress, and the new line is expected to start up in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Georgia-Pacific already has invested more than $30 million since 2012,&amp;quot; said Larry Balch, Dixie plant director. &amp;quot;This latest investment will further modernize the plant and improve its long-term competitiveness in plate manufacturing while meeting the growing demands of our consumers and customers. We appreciate all the support we have received from our local and state economic development partners in making this investment a reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The investment at the Fort Smith plant is part of more than $100 million of planned investments at other Georgia-Pacific facilities in Arkansas during 2014. It also is the latest in a long history of investments in the state by Georgia-Pacific and other Koch companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With this expansion completed, the Fort Smith plant is expected to employ more than 350 people. In Arkansas, Georgia-Pacific facilities employ more than 2,400 people with total annual compensation and benefits of approximately $179 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Georgia-Pacific has been an outstanding corporate citizen in Fort Smith since the facility was built in 1948,&amp;quot; said Tim Allen, CEO and president of the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce. &amp;quot;This expansion illustrates their commitment to Fort Smith for many years to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Skills Shortage Threatens Manufacturers' Earnings and Growth</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. manufacturers may be losing up to 11 percent of their annual earnings as a result of increased production costs stemming from a shortage of skilled workers, according to a new study from Accenture and the Manufacturing Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the study, &amp;quot;Out of Inventory: Skills Shortage Threatens Growth for U.S. Manufacturing,&amp;quot; 39 percent of the 300 U.S. manufacturing executives surveyed described the shortage of qualified, skilled applicants as &amp;quot;severe,&amp;quot; and 60 percent said it has been difficult to hire the skilled people they need. In addition, more than 50 percent of respondents said they plan to increase their production by at least 5 percent in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, as the report notes, when manufacturers are unable to fill roles, overtime, downtime and cycle times increase; more materials are lost to scrap; and quality suffers. More than 70 percent of the respondents reported at least a 5-percent increase in overtime costs, and 32 percent reported an increase of 10 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As manufacturers used overtime to maintain base production levels, 61 percent said their downtime increased by at least 5 percent, as they lacked enough people to run and maintain the equipment. Cycle times also increased at least 5 percent at 66 percent of the respondents&amp;#39; companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The skills shortage facing U.S. manufacturers is apparent from this report, and its severity can be measured in dollars,&amp;quot; said Matt Reilly, senior managing director, Accenture Strategy, North America. &amp;quot;U.S. manufacturers&amp;#39; plans to increase production and grow manufacturing roles over the next five years are positive indicators but are likely to exacerbate the problem. Given today&amp;#39;s limited pool of relevant talent, companies may have to forget the notion of the perfect candidate. Instead, they should look for more generalist skills in candidates and develop them to match the specific work that needs to be done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s getting harder to tell the workers from the managers in today&amp;#39;s plants,&amp;quot; said Blake Moret, senior vice president at Rockwell Automation and chairman of the Manufacturing Institute&amp;#39;s board of trustees. &amp;quot;Production workers, engineers and managers all spend a significant part of their day using advanced technology to configure, control and monitor processes. While these skills are in high demand, the number of qualified people who have them is small. Manufacturers will need to invest in training to develop a highly skilled production workforce that supports the advanced technologies that are essential to modern manufacturing competitiveness today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To mitigate the skills shortage, manufacturers tend to spend more on average for training new hires as opposed to existing employees, with 55 percent spending at least $1,000 per new hire as compared to 42 percent who said they spend at a similar level on training for existing employees. However, the study found no correlation between spending on training and impact on skill shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the report, successful companies spend training dollars as part of an overall strategy designed to address critical skill shortages, with clear objectives set for the short-, medium- and long-term. Based on Accenture&amp;#39;s ongoing research, the report suggests that manufacturers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain a current inventory of in-house skill sets and regularly map that against current and anticipated skill needs to form a talent strategy as well as training investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Adopt and apply statistical analysis and reporting that correlate training programs with key business and operational metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take advantage of digital technologies to make skills training available to employees on a self-paced basis, anytime, anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incorporate nationally recognized certified training programs to build standardized skill sets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engage with educators at colleges, community colleges, trade schools and high schools to build a pipeline of future skilled workers, influence curricula and lend employees to help teach specialized skills to potential manufacturing recruits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Skill-building programs offered by professional organizations offer an avenue for manufacturers seeking to certify their people in specific skill sets,&amp;quot; said Jennifer McNelly, president of the Manufacturing Institute. &amp;quot;Nationally recognized certification programs provide an opportunity for manufacturing employees to grow their capabilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To complete the 2014 report, Accenture and the Manufacturing Institute surveyed more than 300 executives from a diverse set of U.S. manufacturing companies with an average annual revenue of $100 million. Building on the survey responses, they also interviewed a subset of manufacturers, representatives of the Manufacturing Institute and the National Association of Metalworking Skills, as well as economists and industry specialists at the U.S. Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturing Outlook Forecasts Growth Through Innovation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers are entering into a new era of &amp;quot;disruptive complexity&amp;quot; that is fundamentally changing the way they compete and succeed, according to KPMG&amp;#39;s 2014 Global Manufacturing Outlook (GMO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Over the past few years, manufacturers have seen an explosion of new technologies and innovative developments in material science, advanced manufacturing and synergistic operating models,&amp;quot; noted KPMG partner Jeff Dobbs. &amp;quot;With this accelerating pace of change, manufacturers the world over are now starting to take stock of the more complex world that they are operating in and are using that insight to redefine &amp;#39;the art of the possible.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an attempt to capitalize on this environment, manufacturers say they will dramatically increase spending in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), pursue new collaborative business models and integrate new technologies to analyze and stimulate profitable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;rsquo;s Global Manufacturing Outlook was completed in early 2014 and surveyed 460 senior executives in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Respondents represented six industries: aerospace and defense, automotive, conglomerates, consumer products, engineering and industrial products, and metals. Fifty percent of respondents held C-level positions, and a third represented organizations with more than $5 billion in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Focus on Understanding Profitability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s GMO reveals that only 12 percent of manufacturers would categorize themselves as being &amp;ldquo;very effective&amp;rdquo; at determining product profitability. Furthermore, 85 percent of respondents said they plan to make either &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;substantial&amp;quot; investments into systems for product or service cost improvement over the next 12 to 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t simply about mining data and building spreadsheets; it&amp;#39;s about accessing the appropriate information at the right level of granularity and, maybe most importantly, with the right speed and frequency to generate timely insights that help people make better business decisions,&amp;quot; added Jim Scalise, a management consulting partner with KPMG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Growth through Innovation and Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to KPMG&amp;#39;s 2014 GMO, almost half of manufacturers plan to double R&amp;amp;D spending in product development over the next 12 to 24 months. There are also signs that breakthrough innovation is gaining importance as a strategy for 39 percent of industrial manufacturers, up 8 percentage points from KPMG&amp;#39;s 2013 GMO, representing a 25-percent increase in companies pursuing such strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The manufacturing world is in an era of hyper-innovation,&amp;quot; said Dobbs. &amp;quot;Ultimately, those organizations that do not balance investment in &amp;#39;incremental innovation&amp;#39; with investment in &amp;#39;breakthrough innovation&amp;#39; may find themselves left behind competitively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers in Germany appear set to lead in breakthrough innovation with 77 percent citing it as their primary R&amp;amp;D strategy for product development. Among the industrial sectors included in the survey, 50 percent of respondents from the conglomerates sector say breakthrough innovation will be their primary R&amp;amp;D strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In terms of business models, 88 percent of respondents say partnerships over in-house efforts will shape manufacturers&amp;#39; approach to innovation, up significantly from 51 percent in KPMG&amp;#39;s 2013 GMO. Additionally, 68 percent say they are adopting more collaborative business models with suppliers and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improving Supply Chain Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s GMO reveals that limited visibility across the supply chain remains a growing concern for manufacturers, even though many have made notable progress toward improving transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forty percent say they lack information and material visibility across their supply base. Thirty-eight percent say they lack critical details on supplier performance, and 36 percent lack adequate supply chain IT systems. According to half of respondents, the biggest obstacle to achieving more visibility is a lack of mature technology, followed by a lack of governance (19 percent) and a lack of strategy (14 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite those challenges, visibility has improved over the past 12 months with 22 percent of respondents now claiming to have complete visibility (up from just 9 percent in 2013). For the most part, these gains in visibility have resulted from stronger relationships between manufacturers and their top-tier suppliers. More than three-quarters of respondents say that their relationship with top-tier suppliers is now strong enough for them to share real-time capacity and demand data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The upward trend is promising given the fact that almost three-quarters of our respondents think they can achieve a globally integrated supply chain within the next five years,&amp;quot; Dobbs said. &amp;quot;However, we believe there is still much work to be done around trusted relationships, transparency and technology enablement to foster these types of collaborative business models.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Modine to Close Illinois Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Modine Manufacturing Co. recently announced its intention to close its manufacturing facility in McHenry, Ill. The closure is expected to impact approximately 135 full-time employees and generate annual savings of at least $5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company plans to transfer the McHenry production to other facilities in North America, including those in Mexico, Tennessee and Missouri. The McHenry plant makes parallel flow and serpentine condensers, oil coolers and radiators for the automotive, commercial vehicle, off-highway and building HVAC markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plans call for the plant to close over an approximate 18-month period. Modine will provide the affected employees severance benefits and work closely with the Illinois Department of Labor and other state and local agencies to offer employment assistance and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Closing operations is never easy,&amp;quot; said Scott Wollenberg, Modine&amp;#39;s regional vice president. &amp;quot;However, our analysis of Modine&amp;#39;s global product lines and North American manufacturing strategy led us to conclude that the best long-term solution for Modine and its shareholders is to consolidate all North American parallel flow heat exchanger manufacturing into other North American facilities. Closing the McHenry plant will help us rationalize production, maintain the scale we need in our manufacturing operations and improve our overall competitiveness and profitability.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Racine, Wis., Modine specializes in thermal management systems and components.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Increase Efficiency While Cutting Costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/30/d920fe67-b8c5-4cf9-b9d3-3fb2f370e4fb_cut costs.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 311px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The profitability of the manufacturing industry is constantly in a state of flux. While many emerging markets continue to see dramatic increases in the demand for their products, the instability of commodity and operations costs can cause a great deal of variability in profits. Because the costs of raw materials can be so unpredictable, it benefits many manufacturing companies to look for ways to increase their productivity and efficiency while still cutting costs. Being able to achieve this goal allows these companies to maintain their profitability despite the rising and falling commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are just a few ways manufacturers can increase their efficiency while reducing their bottom lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improve Business Processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether at a small mom-and-pop store or a large manufacturing plant, employees often fall into a pattern of doing things &amp;ldquo;the way they have always been done.&amp;rdquo; However, many policies become outdated and inefficient over time. For example, perhaps it used to be necessary to have a purchase approved by multiple departments, but with your current chief financial officer, that process is no longer necessary. Rather than insisting that the purchase move through the old system of command, it would be more efficient and cost-effective to update the policy and send purchase approvals straight to the CFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers can drastically improve their overall business strategies by reviewing their current business processes to find areas that can be redefined, improved or reorganized. By eliminating redundant, out-of-date or unnecessary business practices, manufacturers can see their production processes improve, productivity increase and profits expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Update Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it&amp;#39;s technology used on the manufacturing floor or in corporate offices, efficiency at lower costs is possible by updating and improving a manufacturing plant&amp;#39;s Web tools, software and equipment. Of course, this will require upfront costs to alter the technology of an entire corporation, but this new technology will help manufacturers stay ahead of their competition. Streamlining the production process using high-quality technology and cutting-edge processes leads to fewer overall costs and greater profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to improving the functionality of a plant, continually updating technology to keep pace with innovation shows a manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s willingness to evolve rather than remain static. Suppliers are drawn to companies that stay on top of their game, and other businesses are more likely to partner with well-equipped manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Address the Causes of Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to find the causes of waste in a manufacturing company, it may be beneficial to bring in an outside party that can take an objective look at the company&amp;rsquo;s policies and resources. One of the main areas of waste for many manufacturers is energy use and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A number of companies lose a lot of energy during the production process through poor ventilation or ineffective heating and cooling systems. By finding several of these small areas of energy loss and addressing them, manufacturers can reduce their energy reliance and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, finding areas of wasted labor energy or poor labor management can drastically affect energy efficiency in a plant. A manufacturer may find that its labor force becomes physically fatigued after six hours on the floor. By providing mandatory breaks or shortened shifts, the productivity of the entire operation could improve. Companies that examine and address these areas of wasted energy can significantly improve their efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Take Advantage of Recycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this day of environmental awareness, it comes as little surprise that recycling and reusing manufacturing materials is one of the top ways to cut costs and improve efficiency. Well-equipped facilities are able to efficiently sort large volumes of material waste into usable quantities that can be recycled and reused. These materials can include everything from leftover production substances to scraps of raw materials that can be put back through the manufacturing process. By converting these waste materials into usable products, manufacturers are able to increase their efficiency and profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through careful review and streamlining of processes, many manufacturing plants can improve their overall efficiency while cutting their costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/Zpt0b7q3otE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Navistar to Increase Production</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Navistar International Corporation recently announced that it will be increasing its production rates at its heavy truck assembly plant in Escobedo, Mexico, as well as its bus assembly plant in Tulsa, Okla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Clearly, we&amp;#39;re seeing some positive trends in the industry, but more importantly, we&amp;#39;re seeing good customer response to our product offerings in the market,&amp;quot; said Jack Allen, Navistar chief operating officer. &amp;quot;As a result, we&amp;#39;re increasing our second-half production rates at two of our vehicle manufacturing operations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the second half of the year, the Tulsa bus plant will increase its average daily production rate by about 17 percent over the first half rate, while the Escobedo heavy truck plant will increase its average daily production rate by about 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;#39;s truck assembly plant in Springfield, Ohio, will maintain its current production rate as several facility upgrades are completed and lean manufacturing principles are implemented to drive long-term efficiency and product quality improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In the Class 8 market, we have a complete portfolio of products that deliver the uptime, fuel economy and driver satisfaction our customers demand,&amp;quot; Allen added. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re seeing strong interest from customers for the Cummins ISB engine in our medium-duty trucks and school buses. And, there&amp;#39;s great anticipation for our vocational truck products powered by our 9-liter and 10-liter engines that will launch this summer with SCR emissions technology. With these product offerings, we&amp;#39;re seeing some positive momentum in our truck and bus orders and have an order backlog 80 percent higher than this time last year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>NACCO Materials Handling Group Wins Manufacturing Leadership Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	NACCO Materials Handling Group Inc. (NMHG) was recently named a 2014 Manufacturing Leadership (ML) Award winner by the ML Awards panel of judges for excellence demonstrated by its enterprise product cost management project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now in its 10th year, the ML Awards program honors companies and individuals that are shaping the future of global manufacturing. The program recognizes transformational business projects in a variety of categories, including product, supply chain, customer value and enterprise technology leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leading manufacturer with more than $2.5 billion in global sales, NMHG designs, engineers and manufactures a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts. With its enterprise product cost management project, the company was looking for new ways to streamline its product development process and offset rising costs of materials while maintaining efficient production schedules. It wanted to accelerate the time it took to design and deliver profitable new products and parts to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leveraging aPriori&amp;#39;s software platform, NMHG enabled its design engineers to quickly and easily compare the cost of different product design alternatives and understand the cost impact of different design options. As changes are made or new product specifications are introduced, the software automatically reassesses and provides an updated product cost quickly and easily. This opened up a new set of cost-optimization alternatives for NMHG and enabled its engineers to evaluate more design options without delaying time to market. It also created more accountability for cost earlier in the product development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NMHG and the other recipients of the ML Awards will be honored at the Manufacturing Leadership Summit on June 3-5, 2014, at the Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, Fla.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda's U.S. Plants Build 20 Millionth Automobile</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda&amp;#39;s four American auto plants recently celebrated the cumulative production of 20 million automobiles in the United States. The company also marked the achievement of the 10 millionth U.S.-built Honda Accord rolling off the assembly line at Honda&amp;#39;s first U.S. auto plant in Marysville, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Marysville Auto Plant is the historic site of the first Honda Accord produced in America on Nov. 1, 1982, and the first Japanese auto plant to begin production of automobiles in the United States. Since then, Honda has established automobile manufacturing operations in East Liberty, Ohio; Lincoln, Ala.; and Greensburg, Ind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those plants today manufacture 11 different models, including four passenger cars and seven light trucks. A fifth U.S. plant, the Performance Manufacturing Center, is under construction in Marysville, Ohio, and next year will become the exclusive global production location for the next-generation Acura NSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are deeply aware that our ability to reach this milestone results from the trust that 20 million customers have placed in our products, and we appreciate their support over the past three decades,&amp;quot; said Hidenobu Iwata, president and CEO of Honda of America Manufacturing and head of Honda&amp;#39;s North American manufacturing. &amp;quot;We also value the commitment made by tens of thousands of associates at Honda and our hundreds of suppliers in the U.S. who build products of the highest quality for our customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda&amp;#39;s U.S. plants produced a record 1.3 million automobiles in 2013, an increase of 7.4 percent from the previous annual mark set in 2012. Honda is supported by a network of 533 suppliers in the U.S., with purchasing of parts and components last year exceeding $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Associates at the Marysville Auto Plant have been building the Accord since production began nearly 32 years ago, and over that time have produced the vast majority of Accords for the U.S. and other markets. Today, the plant produces the Accord Sedan, Coupe and the Accord Hybrid. Accord models also were produced for four years at the East Liberty Auto Plant and two years at Honda Manufacturing of Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda&amp;#39;s four U.S. auto plants are supported by engine manufacturing in Lincoln, Ala., and Anna, Ohio, and the production of automatic transmissions in Russells Point, Ohio, and Tallapoosa, Ga. These plants have produced 23.77 million automobile engines and 18.64 million transmissions in the United States. In 2013, nearly 95 percent of the Honda and Acura automobiles sold in the U.S. were produced in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past three years, Honda has invested approximately $1.6 billion in its U.S. auto plants to expand production and implement new technologies in products and manufacturing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Wisconsin Gains Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the second year in a row, industrial employment in Wisconsin posted a gain, according to the 2014 Wisconsin Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Wisconsin gained 3,010 manufacturing jobs from July 2012 to July 2013 and is now home to 11,208 manufacturers employing 574,091 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Wisconsin&amp;#39;s industrial sector continues to grow,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s lower business costs in comparison to its neighbors, educated workforce and central location for the shipment of goods continue to result in many companies investing in its manufacturing sector, particularly those in the food products sector.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in food products manufacturing rose 1.1 percent in Wisconsin over the survey period and is expected to keep rising with the expansion of a Wisconsin&amp;#39;s Dairyfood USA site in Blue Mounds, Seneca Foods&amp;#39; planned expansion of its Janesville plant and Agropur&amp;#39;s plans to expand its cheese-making operations in Luxemburg. Food products manufacturing currently employs 66,266 Wisconsin workers, ranking third in the state for the number of industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other bright spots included commercial lighting company Kenall Manufacturing&amp;#39;s announcement that it plans to move its headquarters to a new facility in Kenosha. In addition, L&amp;amp;M Corrugated Container Corp. opened a new plant in Pleasant Prairie, paper manufacturer Summer Industries established a new facility in Neenah, Kendall Packaging will expand its factory in Mequon, and Wisconsin Oven established a new location in East Troy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial machinery and equipment accounts for the most industrial employment in the state with 311,566 jobs, while fabricated metals manufacturing ranks second with 69,754 industrial jobs. Other sectors to gain jobs included paper products, electronics and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Losses were seen in lumber/wood, stone/clay/glass, printing/publishing, furniture/fixtures and rubber/plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations announcing closures included food packaging plant Pactiv in Chippewa Falls, auto supplier Dana Holding&amp;#39;s location in Milwaukee and Cenveo&amp;#39;s location in Kenosha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Milwaukee remains Wisconsin&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 50,802 industrial jobs. Green Bay was second with 21,825 jobs, followed by Madison with 18,554 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lockheed Martin to Expand Ala. Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lockheed Martin recently broke ground on a new cruise missile annex at its Pike County Operations facility in Troy, Ala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned 62,000-square-foot annex will expand the existing 92,000-square-foot manufacturing facility where the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is produced. The facility also produced test missiles for the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) development program. Construction is slated for completion by the first quarter of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our cruise missile family of systems, in production and in development, plays a critical role in the nation&amp;#39;s defense strategy,&amp;quot; said Frank St. John, vice president of tactical missiles and combat maneuver systems at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. &amp;quot;With this expansion, we plan to leverage our mature and reliable cruise missile production experience to offer affordable, low-risk, long-term capability to warfighters.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion is expected to increase employment by nearly 10 percent over the next few years. The facility employs approximately 300 full-time employees and more than 100 contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Lockheed Martin is willing to invest in Pike County because our employees here demonstrate a commitment to quality, excellence and affordability,&amp;quot; said Dave Anderson, site director of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control&amp;#39;s Pike County Operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pike County Operations has been recognized for its commitment to continuous improvement and performance excellence. In 2012, it received IndustryWeek magazine&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Best Plant&amp;quot; award and the Alabama Performance Excellence Award. It was also a 2012 recipient of the U.S. Department of Commerce&amp;#39;s Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 115,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PGI to Expand Va. Manufacturing Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Polymer Group Inc. (PGI) recently announced that it will spend approximately $8 million to upgrade machinery and expand its manufacturing plant in Waynesboro, Va. The company will also hire up to 20 new employees as part of its ongoing commitment to invest in new technologies to better serve its customers and drive global growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The investment in the Waynesboro plant, along with the recent acquisition of Fiberweb, expands PGI&amp;#39;s spunmelt capabilities and increases PGI&amp;#39;s filtration portfolio to include production and development assets for two nanofiber technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the investment is complete, PGI will be one of the only nonwovens companies able to produce every component needed to make synthetic composites for enhanced mechanical filtration applications. Using these synthetic composites, PGI will initially target the fluid power, facemask, automotive cabin air, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Filtration is a core business for PGI, and we&amp;#39;re dedicated to accelerating growth in this critical segment,&amp;quot; said PGI CEO J. Joel Hackney Jr. &amp;quot;The investment in Waynesboro will allow us to continue on our path of innovation in the technologies we use to serve the filtration segment, as we work to create a safer, cleaner, healthier world for our families and communities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PGI will refurbish more than 20,000 square feet of the Waynesboro plant, upgrade an existing research and development machine used to create proprietary filtration technology, install two additional assets and improve the existing quality lab with state-of-the-art equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The city of Waynesboro is providing tax reimbursement incentives for all new machinery and tools purchased for this project. The new additions are scheduled to be completed by July 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Charlotte, N.C., PGI is a global supplier to leading consumer and industrial product manufacturers, operating 20 facilities in 13 countries with approximately 4,000 employees.

            <title>Developing the Right Strategy for a Target Operating Model</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Today, the industrial manufacturing sector faces significant challenges, including cost and margin challenges, supply-chain issues, pressure from competitors, evolving technology, and stricter regulatory guidelines. Though an initial response to retrench, restructure through aggressive cost-cuts, and consolidate through mergers and acquisitions helped the industry in the last few years, these strategies in isolation may no longer create a sustainable path to future growth or profitability. Industrial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), especially from the oil and gas, power generation, aviation, mining, and train industries, have explored for some time a deeper transformation of their business models. These changes will likely need to be accompanied by an evolution in the companies&amp;#39; existing operating models &amp;mdash; that is, in the way they run selling, general and administrative functions as well as other operation-intensive, clerical or knowledge-based support processes such as reliability and service data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Global business services (GBS), which is the evolution of shared services with a larger global footprint serving multiple functions, helps streamline processes by leveraging a unified &amp;mdash; although not always centralized &amp;mdash; operating entity that collaborates effectively with the rest of the function. GBS serves as a cornerstone for any advanced target operating model and can orchestrate different sourcing structures, including those that are captive or outsourced. Decoupling business functions combined with the advanced use of metrics, data-driven process management, specialized human resources (HR)/organizational design and effective information technology (IT) industrializes operations across the process chain and can improve scalability, lower costs, increase control and provide a better-quality experience for the end client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If GBS is done well, organizations can enable better decisions, pursue growth and adapt to market contractions more nimbly. This article will describe a scientific, granular approach enhanced with industry-specific experiences to adopt the best-fit target operating model for industrial manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Multiple business challenges for industrial manufacturers are exposing them to increased volatility and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Cost and margin pressure.&lt;/strong&gt; Price-sensitive demand and a fluctuating cost for (and availability of) input materials are also adding pressure, and scalable, cost-effective talent is not always readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Supply-chain issues.&lt;/strong&gt; Supplier identification and negotiations, low-cost sourcing, and shared cost analyses are making it increasingly difficult for manufacturing companies to execute &amp;ldquo;design to cost&amp;rdquo; specifications. Moreover, strained supply chains are often expected to support equipment uptime of nearly 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Pressure from competitors. &lt;/strong&gt;Strong local players in new geographic regions are providing established global players with stiff competition, and this competition has drastically reduced the time available to develop new machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;New geographies.&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging market infrastructure projects are driving new demand for capital equipment, and these geographies often have different regulatory and safety standards, creating new challenges for equipment reliability, robustness and safe-failure specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;New technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; Competition is forcing incumbent manufacturers to invest in new technologies that suit evolving performance standards, and the necessary adoption of new technologies further strains the engineering design of component manufacturers. More importantly, new materials and processes mean quality and reliability issues must be routinely analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; &lt;strong&gt;Lack of in-house capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Supporting innovation in equipment design without in-house capabilities is often difficult. In addition, there is a &amp;ldquo;long tail&amp;rdquo; for aftermarket service and refurbishment jobs in the equipment life cycle. The capability gap is likely to increase as design engineering in the capital equipment industry increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To address these challenges, the manufacturing industry is searching for future growth and profitability by incorporating new advances in scientific technology, industry-wide collaboration in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), innovation in engineering, and investment in high-growth emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Existing operating models often limit a company&amp;#39;s choices, as legacy conflicts and inefficiencies scatter efforts, resources and management&amp;#39;s attention. Often, they limit the company&amp;#39;s agility. An agile enterprise that can respond to market trends and implement strategic choices can be supported through a scientific understanding of GBS operating models and process performance to serve key business functions such as finance, supply chain, sales and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A solid first step for an industrial manufacturing company is to simplify complex layers of local, regional and global functions by eliminating decision-making and production processes that have become redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrialized operations help access new growth opportunities, create resilience to hostile market or regulatory conditions, and facilitate enterprise-wide product and business model innovation. They also enable faster innovation in volatile marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increasing the size of a large operation by 20 percent (or strengthening business infrastructure in a new country) typically takes a year or two, but industrialized operations can often achieve this in half the time. When the scale of business process services is increased by a factor of 10, the GBS model can deliver a 50-percent savings in cost per transaction. (A leaner, more predictable cost structure also enables resilience and consistent global application of best practices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/38a20b2b-fae4-423e-90e9-51bb5d1fb729_figure 1b.jpeg" style="width: 480px; height: 350px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Significant potential exists for &amp;ldquo;industrializing&amp;rdquo; operations within industrial manufacturing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 reveals significant industrialization potential within industrial manufacturing, which has largely focused on specific components of engineering R&amp;amp;D but not enough when it comes to industrialization and inclusion in global shared services thus far. The figure also shows up to 50 percent additional potential to industrialize general and administrative (G&amp;amp;A) support, up to 25 percent of marketing and sales (through sales and marketing ops analytics), and up to 30 percent of procurement (through sourcing and direct/indirect procurement support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A closer examination of the Everest Group&amp;#39;s global in-house centers (GIC) data further validates the point. Facilities and administrative (F&amp;amp;A), HR, IT, and customer-care functions are much less industrialized compared to engineering R&amp;amp;D and the same functions in other verticals. Moreover, most companies manage only specific components of engineering R&amp;amp;D, mainly technical documentation and CAD/CAM design, from their captives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similar trends are evident for other manufacturers (automotive, chemicals and consumer electronics), which show a less than optimal industrialization of business support functions through their captive units. Industrial manufacturing and similar archetypes could look to consumer goods and the success it has derived by industrializing back-office support and key sales and marketing activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/0ab7b4bf-5916-4367-a386-dea456640e97_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 528px; height: 369px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Significant variance exists within industrial manufacturing on GBS adoption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Different sub-verticals within industrial manufacturing display different propensities toward managing shared services operations and outsourcing. Figure 2 shows high variance overall with oil and gas OEMs ahead in shared services adoption and outsourcing when compared to automotive and other industrial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 3 illustrates the unrealized potential that industrialized operations can help accrue to industrial manufacturers and their various sub-verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, industrial manufacturing companies spend up to $300 million on service-type operations that can be industrialized. Other manufacturers, such as automotive companies and medical-device manufacturers, can collectively industrialize up to $1 billion on average from service-type operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/cb461f3d-843e-46be-b295-a1b3bb771cc0_figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 518px; height: 371px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Manufacturing companies can realize significant benefits by industrializing service operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Evolving Through the Maturity Curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GBS implementation typically follows three phases, with focus and achievements shifting over time from foundational (often cost-driven) activities to more strategic ones. A typical company&amp;#39;s full realization of benefits using the global business services model is achieved when the company moves beyond the first two phases, which can take between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, forward-looking organizations have successfully shortened the path to return on investment (ROI) with a well-defined target operating model, strategy and execution roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/4729311e-f95b-48ce-ad3d-5febcc31d444_figure 4.jpeg" style="width: 536px; height: 340px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. The full benefits of GBS are realized after the foundational stages are completed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further analysis of the data in Figure 5 shows that manufacturing companies are lagging behind their counterparts from life sciences, consumer goods, and banking and financial services on their scope of work delivered in mature shared services &amp;mdash; in-house or outsourced. The result is slower than average progress on attaining GBS maturity and a lower than expected ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/caa72c48-d544-4b8a-8e7e-be03e886ed3a_figure 5.jpeg" style="width: 538px; height: 379px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Maturity of practices can enable catch-up and eventual leapfrogging in the manufacturing GBS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Higher-touch Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Early efforts to commoditize, standardize and outsource business processes focused on routine, repetitive back-office services such as payroll processing, help-desk operations and accounts payable tasks. Later, routine but low-touch promotional, budgeting, reporting and information technology front-office services were added to these efforts. Now, the industrial manufacturing industry is increasingly outsourcing key components of engineering services such as fundamental research and new product development support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/d1b1c8ff-6355-4d02-94d0-35c0654852b3_figure 6.jpeg" style="width: 535px; height: 366px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. Manufacturing shared services is expanding in scope to include non-commoditized, core industry processes. The combination of process, analytics and technology delivers a far superior outcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrializing high-touch support operations have enabled manufacturers to more quickly market, improve design specifications, improve asset availability and realize higher service revenues. Some successful examples would include an improved equipment uptime for a leading nacelle supplier by improving maintainability design, a two-month reduction in time-to-market through redesigning a combustion trapped vortex for an energy OEM, a $1.2-million savings for a leading aerospace component manufacturer by optimizing product design, and a $15-million enhancement in profits for a global aviation company through contract profitability analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Combining Strategy with Process Delivery Granularity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Scientific understanding of business processes, such as smart enterprise processes, has significantly increased, allowing organizations to correctly estimate the end-to-end business impact of target operating model choices, hence facilitating effective design. Still, some have discovered that building out GBS capabilities can be more difficult than anticipated. This variability across scope, location and delivery models suggests that while broad-brush strategies and comparables have a place in this process, each business case is heavily dependent on the feasibility of the operation&amp;#39;s DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A thorough analysis of the four dimensions shown in Figure 7 is critical for selecting the right target operating or delivery model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Empirical experience and a significant level of granularity help craft the right strategy for a target operating model. A structured approach is recommended, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review the as-is state and rationale. Understand the current state of performance, identify candidates for improvement, and review the process and sub-process practices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify top improvement opportunities. Use best-practice metrics and frameworks to benchmark key areas, identify top areas for improvement, assess the feasibility and risk of options, and conduct a preliminary analysis of benefits such as cost, efficiency or effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify delivery alternatives. Assess options for consolidating processes into internal global shared operations, externally sourced operations or a combination.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine change implications. Outline both financial and risk-related implications for each location and structuring option (e.g., various types of risk).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Build the business case for each alternative. Compile a high-level business case that encompasses process improvement, organizational structuring options, location choices and change implications.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a detailed roll-out plan. Develop a roll-out plan to reach the targeted operating model by process and by location.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Build the final business case. Identify emerging options for each process and develop financial and implementation plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/12/e505f3dd-4de9-4bbd-a8eb-01ae7e2eea5f_figure 7.jpeg" style="width: 538px; height: 406px;" /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 7. Actionable choices patterns emerge by triangulating four themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Viable Operating Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The industrial manufacturing sector is undergoing a complex, transformational change. However, the fast-evolving technology, local regulatory burden and increased competition can actually offer opportunities for growth to companies that find ways to invest in new business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Business agility in times of unprecedented volatility is an imperative that requires a more strategic role for business operations. Additionally, embracing new operating models can create organizations that not only are more resilient but also can compete best in times of volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations looking to redefine their operating models, a significant amount of specialized knowledge is needed to navigate the continuum of design choices. In such a focused field, the strategy must leverage the experience curve of large organizations&amp;#39; journeys over the past decade. Although industrial manufacturing companies&amp;#39; operations present challenges unique to the industry, they benefit from the knowledge accumulated in the industries in which the transformation began earlier. Combining this experience with a clear understanding of an organization&amp;#39;s strategic needs, capabilities and industry context can help craft the right strategy for a target operating model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/manufacturing/~4/c8oB_N30PF4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Pennsylvania Manufacturing Jobs Decline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Pennsylvania declined slightly over the past year according to the 2014 Pennsylvania Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Pennsylvania lost 1,053 manufacturing jobs from July 2012 to July 2013, in contrast to the 3,000 manufacturing jobs the directory reported the state gained over the 2011-2012 survey period. The state is now home to 17,191 manufacturers employing 811,432 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturers in Pennsylvania are still recovering from the recession, and high business taxes have affected hiring,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI president. &amp;quot;However, the state&amp;#39;s educated workforce, access to capital and its reputation as a center for innovation continue to be a draw for new business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the state included the opening of a Siemens Healthcare ultrasound systems facility in Plymouth Meeting, the planned expansion of Veka Inc.&amp;#39;s vinyl window plant in Fombell, Hershey&amp;#39;s $300-million investment in its facility in Hershey and Coca-Cola&amp;#39;s plans to expand its plant in Upper Macungie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the natural gas drilling boom in the Marcellus Shale, employment in oil and gas extraction rose 16 percent in the state over the survey period. Oil and gas extraction currently employs 7,178 Pennsylvania workers, or about one percent of the state&amp;#39;s total industrial workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional gains were seen in transportation equipment, electronics, instruments/related products and stone/clay/glass. Sectors that lost jobs included petroleum products, chemicals, furniture/fixtures, printing/publishing and lumber/wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing locations announcing closures included FesslerUSA&amp;#39;s 112-year-old garment plant in Orwigsburg, Lancaster Preferred Partners&amp;#39; auto parts plant in Lancaster, Penn Refrigeration&amp;#39;s facility in Wilkes-Barre and a Hostess bakery in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial machinery and equipment accounts for the most manufacturing employment in the state with 93,817 jobs. Second-ranked fabricated metals employs 86,010 workers, while third-ranked food products manufacturing represents 84,621 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Philadelphia remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 43,313 workers. Pittsburgh was second with 36,679 jobs, while York ranked third with 22,052 industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford to Add 350 Jobs at Ky. Truck Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. will add 350 new jobs and invest $80 million in its Kentucky Truck Plant to meet growing demand for its F-Series Super Duty trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The $80 million will pay for facility upgrades, retooling and increased capacity to meet market demand. The investment and new employment opportunities are estimated to result in a 15-percent increase in production capacity or approximately 55,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Customer demand for F-Series Super Duty trucks is growing substantially, and F-Series overall is America&amp;#39;s best-selling truck for 37 years running,&amp;quot; said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of the Americas. &amp;quot;Building on more than 100 years of manufacturing in Kentucky, we are proud to expand our profitable growth in the region as a result of our leadership in trucks and SUVs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Kentucky Truck Plant, which opened in 1969, produces the F-250, F-350, F-450 and F-550 Super Duty pickups, as well as Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. The plant covers 6 million square feet and employs close to 4,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are happy to be adding new jobs at the Kentucky Truck Plant because we know the impact these jobs will have on the local community,&amp;quot; said Jimmy Settles, UAW vice president, National Ford Department. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s especially rewarding to know these jobs come as a result of customer demand. It shows customers understand and appreciate the dedication our UAW Ford workers put into delivering top-quality products like Ford F-Series Super Duty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Celebrating its 65th anniversary last year, Ford F-Series topped 750,000 sales in 2013, with more than 70,000 trucks sold in December after eight straight months of sales above 60,000 vehicles. On average, a single F-Series pickup was sold every 41 seconds in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Colorado Gains Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the third year in a row, industrial employment in Colorado posted a gain, according to the 2014 Colorado Manufacturers Directory, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI&amp;#39;s survey of Colorado manufacturers reports the state gained 3,513 industrial jobs between June 2012 and June 2013, which was 1.5 percentage points above the national average gain. The state is now home to 6,510 manufacturers and 210,050 related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Colorado&amp;#39;s manufacturing sector continues to grow,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s winning mix of an educated workforce, friendly business environment and abundant natural resources has helped the state to boost exports and expand hiring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots over the year included the expansion of Epic Brewing&amp;#39;s brewery in Denver; the recent announcement that a joint venture of ConAgra Foods, Cargill and CHS will open a headquarters in Denver under the name of Ardent Mills; and the expansion of Terumo BCT&amp;#39;s manufacturing location in Lakewood. In addition, recent reports show Colorado increased its exports by 11.3 percent in 2012, a record for the state and more than triple the national average gain for the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Losses for the state included the closure of a Hostess bakery in Denver and GE&amp;#39;s cancellation of its plans to build a solar panel factory near Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electronics manufacturing remains the state&amp;#39;s largest sector by factory employment, accounting for 24,103 jobs. Food products manufacturing accounts for another 24,010 jobs, while third-ranked industrial machinery and equipment employs 21,200 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other industrial sectors that gained jobs included oil and gas extraction, petroleum products, stone/clay/glass, instruments/related products, fabricated metals and transportation equipment. Losses were seen in paper products, chemicals, furniture/fixtures and textiles/apparel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Colorado&amp;#39;s top cities by manufacturing employment all posted gains over the year. Denver remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 41,070 industrial workers, while Colorado Springs accounts for 18,046 jobs. Englewood ranks third in the state with 13,641 industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lockheed Martin Facility Named Best Plant for 2013</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lockheed Martin&amp;#39;s facility in Archbald, Pa., was recently named one of IndustryWeek magazine&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Best Plants&amp;quot; for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, IndustryWeek&amp;#39;s Best Plants program recognizes facilities on the leading edge of manufacturing and operational excellence, with ongoing efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction, and create stimulating and rewarding work environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The 2013 IndustryWeek Best Plants winners are shining examples of the operational excellence that thrives among North American manufacturers,&amp;quot; said IndustryWeek senior editor Jill Jusko. &amp;quot;We applaud the commitment of leadership and team members at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Archbald, Pa., to excellence today and continued improvement going forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The approximately 420 employees at Missiles and Fire Control&amp;#39;s Archbald facility design and manufacture precision-guided weapon systems and nuclear systems for military and civil customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key factor contributing to the plant&amp;rsquo;s recognition was a highly motivated workforce focused on continuous improvement using lean principles. The facility&amp;rsquo;s use of integrated program teams to keep employees engaged while providing the knowledge, training and tools to perform was also a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This award recognizes the Lockheed Martin Archbald team and their commitment to excellence in support of our customers,&amp;quot; said David Opalka, acting site director for Lockheed Martin&amp;#39;s Archbald facility. &amp;quot;In military and nuclear energy environments, lives depend on our products working each and every time. Our culture of continuous improvement ensures that our manufacturing teams maintain the high level of quality and performance that our customers require.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control was also a 2012 recipient of the U.S. Department of Commerce&amp;#39;s Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the Archbald plant, other Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control facilities that have received IndustryWeek&amp;#39;s Best Plants awards include facilities in Troy, Ala.; Camden, Ark.; Orlando and Ocala, Fla.; and Lufkin, Texas.

            <title>Air Products Opens Heat-Exchanger Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Air Products recently dedicated a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat-exchanger manufacturing facility in Manatee County, Fla., which will double the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing capacity. The facility currently employs more than 50 people and will begin manufacturing as scheduled within the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This plant will meet a defined LNG production market need around the globe,&amp;quot; said Air Products&amp;#39; chairman, president and CEO John McGlade. &amp;quot;At this location, Air Products will be able to supply the additional capacity required to stay ahead of increasing customer demand and specifically for the manufacture of larger LNG heat exchangers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The location of the new manufacturing facility provides ready access to port services and will facilitate global shipping of what is typically already very large equipment. It will also allow Air Products to manufacture the even larger LNG heat exchangers that are being demanded by the market. The roughly 300,000-square-foot facility could employ approximately 250 employees in a four-year ramp-up period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The employees we have already hired at Port Manatee are eager and ready to get started manufacturing LNG heat exchangers,&amp;quot; said Sandy McLauchlin, general manager of Air Products&amp;#39; LNG engineering and manufacturing. &amp;quot;This site has exactly what we need to meet developing market needs, that being readily available port access that removes any shipping constraints we had previously faced with this larger equipment. This new second facility, along with our current manufacturing plant in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., should be able to meet the LNG industry needs going forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For more than 45 years, Air Products has manufactured LNG heat exchangers as large as 15.5 feet in diameter, 180 feet long and weighing as much as 500 tons at its existing facility in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Automotive Parts Supplier Expands to Kansas City</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Kansas City Area Development Council recently announced that Grupo Antolin North America will invest more than $15.7 million in a 148,800-square-foot automotive manufacturing facility in Kansas City, Mo., creating an estimated 118 new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grupo Antolin&amp;#39;s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility will initially produce interior overhead liners for the new Ford Transit van, which will be manufactured at Ford&amp;#39;s Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Kansas City represents enormous opportunities for Grupo Antolin,&amp;quot; said Max Rogers, president of Grupo Antolin North America. &amp;quot;Missouri&amp;#39;s friendly corporate climate and close proximity to major automakers put us in a position to better serve our clients and continue to grow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grupo&amp;#39;s investment demonstrates our region&amp;#39;s strength as a manufacturing and transportation powerhouse,&amp;quot; said Bob Marcusse, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. &amp;quot;Ford&amp;#39;s Kansas City Assembly Plant, which is currently undergoing a $1.1 billion expansion, was the nation&amp;#39;s busiest auto plant last year, producing nearly a half million units.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An international automotive parts manufacturing company, Grupo Antolin is headquartered in Spain and has 100 manufacturing plants and 22 offices in 25 countries, including nine facilities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Winnebago to Open Additional Manufacturing Facility in Iowa</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Winnebago Industries Inc. recently announced plans to expand its manufacturing footprint to nearby Lake Mills, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The recreation vehicle manufacturer and the city of Lake Mills have come to an agreement on a 5-year lease of the 100,000-square-foot plant formerly owned and operated by Cummins Filtration. The Lake Mills facility will be used for the production of Winnebago&amp;#39;s Class B motorhomes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a definite win-win for us,&amp;quot; said Randy Potts, Winnebago chairman, CEO and president. &amp;quot;The Lake Mills facility is much larger than our current Class B production facility in Charles City and allows us to expand our growing Class B motorhome line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Winnebago&amp;#39;s Class B market share in the U.S. has been steadily rising from 7.8 percent in 2011 to 17.9 percent through September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company plans to begin the process of staffing and equipping the Lake Mills facility immediately, with the goal of starting initial production by early February. The Charles City facility will continue to manufacture Class B motorhomes as the company transitions to the Lake Mills facility and moves other subassembly operations to Charles City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With the close proximity of Lake Mills, it&amp;#39;s very cost effective to transport components and motorhomes the 16 miles between Lake Mills and our headquarters in Forest City,&amp;quot; Potts said. &amp;quot;In turn, it allows us to transition our current Class B production facility in Charles City to additional subassembly operations.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Blastcrete Acquires Neal Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Neal Manufacturing recently announced that it has partnered with Blastcrete Equipment Co. and will move its operations to Blastcrete&amp;#39;s 70,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Anniston, Ala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Neal will now operate as a division of Blastcrete, with all key Neal employees relocating to Blastcrete and joining four former Neal employees, including former Neal president Maury Bagwell, who has served as general manager at Blastcrete since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Neal fits Blastcrete like a glove,&amp;quot; said Blastcrete president Jim Farrell. &amp;quot;It is very unusual in a new partnership that you have the luxury of blending over 50 years of manufacturing experience. This opportunity eliminates any learning curve for us and allows us to start from day one providing our new Neal customers with world-class equipment and service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1978 Neal has manufactured asphalt sealcoating equipment. The Neal product line includes self-propelled and trailer-mounted machines in several sizes as well as skid-mounted machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Established in 1950, Blastcrete is a leading manufacturer of mixing, pumping and spraying equipment serving the refractory, shotcrete, concrete construction and repair, underground mining and tunneling, and power generation industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Like Neal, Blastcrete has remained on the leading edge of introducing new technology to the industries that we serve,&amp;quot; Farrell said. &amp;quot;We are excited to see how some of these proven technologies that we have developed at Blastcrete might offer opportunities in the asphalt sealcoating industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Raytheon to Expand Mississippi Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Raytheon recently announced plans to increase the size of its manufacturing facility in Forest, Miss., by more than 20,000 square feet and hire more than 150 new workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Already one of the largest defense manufacturing plants in Mississippi at 340,000 square feet, the Raytheon plant will see an increase in capacity with the new positions expected to be added over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Forest will be expanded to support anticipated growth in airborne radar and electronic warfare markets,&amp;quot; said Rick Yuse, Raytheon&amp;#39;s space and airborne systems president. &amp;quot;During the past three decades, Raytheon&amp;#39;s success in Mississippi has resulted in the addition of more than 30 programs and three shifts per day to ensure that the world&amp;#39;s most advanced military forces have access to our technology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year, the Forest plant ramped up its fighter jet radar production rates 10-fold, achieving a 2012 on-time delivery rate of 100 percent. It also celebrated an industry-first milestone with the delivery of more than 500 active electronically scanned array (AESA) aircraft radars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to fighter jet radars, the facility makes the Sentinel air defense radar, with 57 additional models in production for the U.S. Army.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>North Dakota Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the third year in a row, industrial employment in North Dakota posted a gain, according to the 2014 North Dakota Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports North Dakota gained 1,734 manufacturing jobs from May 2012 to May 2013, which was 3.5 percentage points above the national average. The state is now home to 1,248 manufacturers employing 44,311 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;North Dakota industry continues to grow,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s winning mix of low business costs, an educated workforce and abundant natural resources has resulted in many companies investing in its industrial sector, particularly those in the oil and gas industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in oil and gas extraction rose 14.6 percent in North Dakota over the survey period, with jobs more than doubling in response to the Bakken Shale oil boom. Oil and gas extraction currently employs 8,156 North Dakota workers or 18 percent of the state&amp;#39;s total industrial workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial machinery and equipment accounts for the most manufacturing employment in the state, employing 8,414 workers, with no significant change over the year. Industrial employment gains were seen in most sectors, including fabricated metals, chemicals, instruments/related products, stone/clay/glass, transportation equipment, rubber/plastics and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the state included Carbontec Energy Corp&amp;#39;s plans to open an iron plant in Jamestown and the recent expansion of Cirrus Aircraft&amp;#39;s factory in Grand Forks. In addition, energy firm Oneok announced plans to open a gas-processing plant in Williston, John Deere expanded its plants in Fargo and Valley City, Minn-Dak Farmers expanded a beet-processing facility in Wahpeton, and the previously shuttered Noodles by Leonardo pasta factory recently reopened under the name of Cando Pasta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Losses were seen in furniture/fixtures, lumber/wood and printing/publishing. Industrial locations announcing closures included DMI Industries, which shuttered its wind tower plant in West Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Fargo remains North Dakota&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 9,880 industrial jobs. Second-ranked Williston accounts for 6,242 jobs, while Grand Forks is home to 2,742 industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Material Handling Unveils New North American Headquarters</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/11/5/7bfb1c75-2e41-42cc-b7cf-fc70e1df18b7_toyota facility.jpeg" style="width: 312px; height: 208px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Toyota Material Handling U.S.A. Inc. (TMHU) recently unveiled its new North American headquarters in Columbus, Ind. The grand opening marks the final stage of a strategic initiative to align TMHU&amp;#39;s sales and marketing team with its manufacturing plant &amp;mdash; Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. Inc. (TIEM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new headquarters represents a $4.6-million investment and adds 21,400 square feet to the Toyota campus, which includes the manufacturing facility and national headquarters. The combined TMHU and TIEM campus now totals more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing and support space and houses more than 1,000 Toyota associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toyota made a commitment more than one year ago to align our teams under one roof to combine synergies and allow us to be even more responsive to customer and dealer needs,&amp;quot; said Jeff Rufener, TMHU president. &amp;quot;Today, we celebrate this partnership and set our sights on continued leadership in the market and support of our associates, dealers and customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When TIEM established its lift-truck plant operations in 1990, the facility covered approximately 7 acres under one roof. Since that time, TIEM has undergone 12 expansions. The zero-landfill campus now totals more than 1 million square feet of facilities sitting on 126 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By uniting TMHU and TIEM onto one central campus, we are fostering increased collaboration that will further improve efficiencies and product development,&amp;quot; said TIEM&amp;#39;s president Toshiya Yamagishi. &amp;ldquo;Looking ahead, TIEM&amp;#39;s model of excellence will be emulated in a new lift-truck manufacturing plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the &amp;quot;lead plant&amp;quot; for Toyota&amp;#39;s manufacturing facility in Sao Paulo, Brazil, TIEM associates from Indiana will be responsible for training the Brazil plant leaders on production engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance and production control. Upon completion of the new facility, TIEM will be the first Toyota industrial manufacturing plant outside of Japan to supply parts to a Toyota Industries Corporation plant in another country.&lt;/p&gt;

	The initial phase of the investment will include catalyst and adsorbents production capacity for Honeywell UOP, a PMT business that is a leading international supplier of catalysts, adsorbents, equipment and process technology for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemicals and renewable energy industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;PMT continues to experience strong growth in Asia, driven by new process technologies and materials in demand in China and other parts of this key region,&amp;quot; said Andreas Kramvis, president and CEO of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. &amp;quot;This investment is an additional milestone in expanding PMT&amp;#39;s global footprint and demonstrates our commitment to supporting our rapid business growth in China and the rest of Asia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The more than 120-acre site is PMT&amp;#39;s first wholly owned manufacturing campus in China and is located in an established, world-class industrial park in Zhangjiagang, which is located 85 miles northwest of Shanghai. The manufacturing operations are expected to source raw materials locally. The new manufacturing campus will also support sustainable economic development of Jiangsu Province through development of the local supplier base and labor pool.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lockheed Martin to Build Joint Light Tactical Vehicles at Arkansas Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lockheed Martin will move production of its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to an assembly line at the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing complex in Camden, Ark., where the company expects to gain significant production efficiencies and cost reductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Lockheed Martin is implementing a low-risk production plan that will take advantage of the proven, outstanding Camden manufacturing operation and help make our JLTV more affordable for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps,&amp;quot; said Scott Greene, vice president of ground vehicles for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	JLTV prototypes were produced at BAE Systems&amp;#39; manufacturing facility in Sealy, Texas, but plans were recently announced to close the Sealy plant. BAE Systems will remain a key partner on the Lockheed Martin JLTV team, providing integrated cabs, protection solutions and other vehicle manufacturing expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;BAE Systems remains committed to Lockheed Martin and our JLTV program,&amp;quot; said Mark Signorelli, vice president and general manager of combat vehicles for BAE Systems. &amp;quot;Recognizing the budget pressures our customers face, the team is reshaping our efforts to provide the most cost-competitive offering with exceptional technical capability and product quality to our end users.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lockheed Martin&amp;#39;s Camden complex has a strong reputation for on-schedule delivery of high-quality products including High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missiles and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ground vehicles. Over the last decade Camden has won more than 60 awards for quality, safety, security and community service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Designed as a more capable and survivable replacement for many of the current Army and Marine Corps HMMWV &amp;quot;Humvee&amp;quot; vehicles, the Lockheed Martin JLTV is systems-engineered to return crucial protection, mobility and transportability to soldiers and marines. Its advantages include improved crew protection and mobility, lower logistical support costs, superior fuel efficiency, exportable power-generation with substantial margin for future growth, and state-of-the-art connectivity with other platforms and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide.

            <title>Northrop Grumman Assembly Line Named Plant of the Year </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Northrop Grumman Corp.&amp;#39;s F-35 Integrated Assembly Line (IAL) was recently named &amp;quot;Assembly Plant of the Year&amp;quot; by &lt;em&gt;Assembly Magazine&lt;/em&gt; in recognition of the facility&amp;#39;s world-class processes to reduce costs, increase productivity and improve quality. Northrop Grumman is the first aerospace company to receive the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspired by automation systems used by automakers, the IAL was designed and developed by Northrop Grumman, working with KUKA Systems Corp.&amp;#39;s Aerospace Division, a commercial automation integrator. The IAL is central to producing the F-35&amp;#39;s center fuselage as well as driving new levels of efficiency into the manufacturing process, reducing process times, increasing precision and quality, and decreasing production costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Northrop Grumman has been a leader in designing, developing and applying automated systems to the complex task of assembling modern fighter aircraft,&amp;quot; said Brian Chappel, vice president of the F-35 program for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. &amp;quot;The IAL is one example where Northrop Grumman maximizes robotics and automation, providing additional capacity and assembly capability while meeting engineering tolerances that are not easily achieved using manual methods.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Northrop Grumman&amp;#39;s Palmdale site is a world-class facility that provides assembly, integration, testing and long-term maintenance capabilities for the F-35 and other advanced aircraft, including the B-2 Spirit and RQ-4 Global Hawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to manufacturing the F-35 center fuselage, Northrop Grumman designed and produces the aircraft&amp;#39;s radar and other key avionics including electro-optical, communications, navigation and identification subsystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Northrop Grumman also develops mission systems and mission planning software, leads the team&amp;#39;s development of pilot and maintenance training system courseware, and manages the team&amp;#39;s use, support and maintenance of low-observable technologies. In 2012, the company delivered 32 center fuselages and is on track to exceed delivery quantities in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

	For the second year in a row, industrial employment in Georgia posted a gain, according to the Georgia Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Georgia gained 7,769 manufacturing jobs from May 2012 to May 2013, or 1.6 percent, which was more than double the gain reported for the 2011-2012 survey period and one percentage point above the national average gain. Georgia is now home to 9,802 manufacturers employing 481,936 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Georgia&amp;#39;s industrial climate continues to improve,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s reasonable labor costs and friendly business environment continue to result in many companies investing in its manufacturing sector, particularly those in the auto/transportation equipment industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in transportation equipment rose 6.2 percent in Georgia over the survey period and is expected to keep rising with Kia Motors&amp;#39; continued expansion of its West Point facility and Hitachi&amp;#39;s plans to expand operations at its Monroe location. Transportation equipment currently employs 40,370 Georgia workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other bright spots for the state included the opening of a Starbucks plant in Augusta and the establishment of FPL Food&amp;#39;s beef processing plant in Thomasville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Food products manufacturing accounts for the most industrial employment in the state with 68,692 jobs. Second-ranked textiles/apparel manufacturing employs 55,262 workers but represents the largest employment decline, down 1.8 percent over the survey period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other sectors to gain jobs included instruments/related products, primary metals, printing/publishing, furniture/fixtures, chemicals and rubber/plastics. Losses were seen in lumber/wood and paper products following the closure of Glit/Microtron&amp;#39;s facility in Wrens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Atlanta remains Georgia&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 58,124 industrial jobs. Second-ranked Dalton accounts for 21,367 jobs, while Norcross is home to 18,058 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturing Leaders Form Task Force to Tackle Key Issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar CEO and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) board chair Doug Oberhelman recently announced the formation of a task force of business and manufacturing leaders that will tackle the workforce challenges hampering the continued growth of American manufacturing competitiveness in the global marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two of the most pressing issues the task force will address are the mounting skills gap between the preparedness of workers and the capabilities manufacturers need, and the scarcity of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A strong manufacturing base is a critical foundation for strengthening the American economy, and to be successful, a strong manufacturing economy requires a highly skilled workforce,&amp;quot; said Oberhelman. &amp;quot;It is an issue that will help to define our potential growth and shape manufacturing for decades to come. This multi-industry task force will supply the necessary policy solutions that should provide a road map to follow so that we can have the best workforce in the world.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The NAM Task Force on Competitiveness and the Workforce will be led by Chip Blankenship, president and CEO of GE Appliances. He will be joined by 15 NAM board members representing a diverse group of U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The task force will launch in January with a hearing-style discussion to identify common problems across industries and explore solutions. The group will work with public and private sector representatives through 2014 to develop concrete proposals regarding how the private sector and government at all levels can work more effectively together to ensure that the United States has a globally competitive workforce. The task force also will deliver a detailed advocacy plan so that NAM can work with governments to implement these proposals and develop the workforce that meets the needs of modern manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Domtar to Expand North Carolina Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Domtar Corporation recently announced that it will expand its facility in Greenville, N.C., and locate its North American operations center in Pitt County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company is expected to create 35 new jobs and invest $100,000 over the next three years at the Attends facility in Greenville, N.C., which currently employs approximately 300 people. Attends has operated in Greenville since 1999. The city has served as Attends&amp;#39; headquarters since 2007. Domtar acquired Attends in 2011 to position the company for an increased share of the growing consumer products market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Domtar, which operates pulp and paper, distribution and personal-care business segments, has invested approximately $20 million in eastern North Carolina over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As a wood fiber innovation company with a global sales footprint in pulp, paper and absorbent hygiene products, North Carolina is a big part of our growth story,&amp;quot; said Domtar president and CEO John D. Williams. &amp;quot;With a fluff pulp mill and bio-chemical plant in Plymouth, a personal-care manufacturing facility in Greenville, as well as our global personal-care headquarters in Raleigh, this state is a symbol of Domtar&amp;#39;s past and future working together for long-term prosperity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Louisiana Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the second year in a row, industrial employment in Louisiana posted a gain, according to the 2013 Louisiana Manufacturers Register published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Louisiana gained 5,685 manufacturing jobs from May 2012 to May 2013, or 2.9 percent, which was more than double the gain reported for the 2011-2012 survey period and two percentage points above the national average gain as reported by the Labor Department. Louisiana is now home to 5,264 manufacturers employing 196,432 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Louisiana&amp;#39;s industrial climate continues to improve,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s abundant natural resources and friendly business environment continue to result in many companies investing in its industrial sector, particularly those in the oil and gas and chemicals industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in oil and gas extraction rose 17.2 percent in Louisiana over the survey period, with the third-ranking sector currently accounting for 22,824 of the state&amp;#39;s industrial jobs. Oil and gas companies that have announced plans to locate facilities in Louisiana included South Africa-based Sasol, which will open a natural gas to diesel plant in Westlake, and Methanex, which recently announced it would open a second ethanol plant in Geismar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports employment in Louisiana&amp;#39;s chemicals sector increased 1.4 percent and currently ranks first in the state for industrial employment at 25,296 jobs. Bright spots for the chemicals industry included Dyno Nobel&amp;#39;s plans to build an ammonia plant in Jefferson Parish, the expansion of Nalco&amp;#39;s dry polymer plant in Garyville, the expansion of two ExxonMobil chemical plants in Baton Rouge and Port Allen, and the recent opening of Myriant&amp;#39;s biochemical production facility in Lake Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other sectors to gain jobs included transportation equipment, industrial machinery and equipment, fabricated metals, primary metals, instruments/related products and textiles/apparel. Losses were seen in electronics, printing/publishing, furniture/fixtures, paper products and stone/clay/glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations closing down included PepsiCo&amp;#39;s bottling plant in St. John the Baptist Parish, International Paper&amp;#39;s container plant in Minden and Hostess-operated Cotton Brothers Bakery in Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Baton Rouge remains Louisiana&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment, with 15,654 industrial jobs. Second-ranked Houma is home to 10,248 jobs, while Shreveport accounts for 10,245 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Auburn Manufacturing Expands Maine Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Auburn Manufacturing Inc. (AMI) recently broke ground on a $1.4-million, 22,500-square-feet expansion of its Kittyhawk manufacturing facility in Auburn, Maine. When completed, the expansion will nearly double the size of the facility and require hiring a number of new employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The new expansion will not only facilitate our current growth, but it also will provide the extra space we need for our continued focus on innovation, particularly in the areas of coatings, nanotechnologies and heat-protection enhancements,&amp;quot; said AMI president and CEO Kathie Leonard. &amp;quot;With this new expansion, we will have the opportunity to continue developing the most advanced, safest and high-quality flexible barriers against extreme-temperature challenges.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AMI also operates a manufacturing plant in Mechanic Falls, Maine, which is currently running at full capacity. The expanded Kittyhawk facility is expected to be fully operational in September.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of textile products for hundreds of extreme-temperature industrial applications, including welding protection, industrial insulation, safety apparel, gaskets and seals, as well as other OEM and maintenance, repair, operations and production applications, AMI hopes to expand the Kittyhawk facility again in three to five years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Commences Production of Fusion at Michigan Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford&amp;#39;s assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich., recently began production on the new Fusion, marking the first time the car has been built in the United States. The move expands Fusion availability by more than 30 percent &amp;ndash; up to 350,000 units annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Fusion in Flat Rock is a win for all of our stakeholders, including customers, employees and dealers,&amp;quot; said Ford president Joe Hinrichs. &amp;quot;At the same time, Ford is continuing its massive investment in America by creating another 1,400 jobs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 1,400 new employees Ford hired to support added production at the Flat Rock assembly plant puts the company more than 75 percent of the way toward its goal of creating 12,000 hourly jobs in the United States by 2015. In 2013 alone, Ford is hiring nearly 6,500 new hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. to support products, growth and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prepare Flat Rock&amp;#39;s newest hires to build the Fusion, a simulated factory has been introduced to provide hands-on training in a real-world environment. The simulated factory allows workers to master the tasks they may be performing on the line. It also is expected to help reduce employee attrition and improve overall manufacturing and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are thrilled to have added production of Fusion at Flat Rock Assembly Plant &amp;ndash; not just for our dedicated workforce here but for the entire metro Detroit community and the associated jobs it will create,&amp;quot; said UAW vice president Jimmy Settles. &amp;quot;Together with the domestic automakers and through the collective bargaining process, we are able to bring jobs to the U.S. that were previously located offshore. Fusion production in Flat Rock is a key part of that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of a $555-million investment, the Flat Rock assembly plant has added a state-of-the-art, fully flexible body shop to allow multiple models to be produced on the same assembly line, supporting Ford&amp;#39;s flexible manufacturing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford also has upgraded the plant&amp;#39;s paint shop with installation of its three-wet paint process, which is more environmentally friendly and takes less time than conventional paint processes. Other technologies incorporated at Flat Rock include laser brazing, a form of welding that will be used on the Fusion to attach the roof of the car to the body with a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing seam. In 2014, dirt-detection technology will be introduced to ensure optimal paint and surface quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Flat Rock assembly plant also produces the Ford Mustang and recently celebrated the 1 millionth Mustang built at the facility. With the addition of Fusion production, the Flat Rock assembly plant will have approximately 3,000 employees working two shifts at full line speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fusion is also produced at the Hermosillo assembly plant in Mexico and the Chongqing assembly plant in China.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Glass Manufacturing Plant Cited for Serious Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Owens-Brockway Glass Container plant in Zanesville, Ohio, has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for six safety violations carrying proposed penalties of $61,000 following a complaint inspection initiated in March. A repeat violation for a lack of signs marking exit directions was just one of the violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Owens-Brockway Glass Container has a responsibility to install properly working exit signs to protect workers on the job,&amp;quot; said Deborah Zubaty, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Columbus, Ohio. &amp;quot;Employers who are cited for repeat violations demonstrate a lack of commitment to employee safety and health.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA issues repeat violations if an employer previously was cited for the same or a similar violation of any standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The same violation was cited at a facility in Atlanta in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five serious violations were also cited, including a lack of fall protection for workers on open-sided platforms, nonworking emergency lighting, failing to require the use of head protection for workers exposed to overhead hazards, lack of an emergency eye-washing station for exposure to corrosive materials, and the use of an electrical panel box that not was protected from water and damp conditions. An OSHA violation is considered serious if death or serious physical harm can result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With headquarters in Perrysburg, Ohio, Owens-Brockway Glass Container produces glass containers for the food and beverage industry. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and notice of proposed penalties to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. If the company does not file or contest within that period, it must abate the cited conditions within the period ordered in the citations and pay the proposed penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Osborn Expands California Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/20/363945ee-e428-4ddd-abcc-955a2c148f53_OsbornSantaFeSpringsFacility.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 233px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;Osborn recently expanded its manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., to include all its product lines, including buff, brush and compound product line production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing and distribution center previously only provided services for Osborn&amp;#39;s buff product line. By expanding its West Coast facility, the company hopes to improve availability and delivery for Osborn customers in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We identified the need to expand this facility and the product lines due to the increased demand in the region,&amp;quot; said Todd Reasonover, Osborn&amp;#39;s national director of sales. &amp;quot;By producing and distributing all product lines at this facility, West Coast customers will have an overall better experience from order to delivery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier in 2013, Osborn implemented a new sales growth strategy to enable effective and efficient growth. The expansion of its capabilities in Santa Fe Springs is part of improving efficiency in the areas of sales, inventory and logistics. The new facility will also continue to adhere to Osborn&amp;#39;s commitment to quality, innovation, excellence and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A unit of Jason Inc., Osborn is a leading supplier of surface-treatment solutions and high-quality finishing tools for hundreds of industrial and commercial applications such as metal finishing, honing and surface polishing. The company has operations in 15 countries and serves customers in more than 100 countries.

            <title>ZF Opens Passenger Car Transmission Plant in South Carolina</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ZF Friedrichshafen AG recently opened its first plant for automatic passenger car transmissions in the United States. Located approximately 25 miles south of Greenville, S.C., ZF Transmissions Gray Court LLC will serve as the manufacturing site for the company&amp;#39;s 8-speed automatic transmission (8HP) as well as the world&amp;#39;s first 9-speed automatic transmission (9HP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Approximately 1.2 million transmissions are expected to be produced at the plant annually, including 400,000 8HPs and 800,000 9HPs. Previously, the 8HP was only manufactured in Saarbrucken, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ZF has already invested nearly $385 million in building the new location and expects the total investment in the facility to reach $600 million, which will be the largest single investment in the almost century-long history of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 950,000-square-foot facility will soon expand to almost 1.4 million square feet by 2016, with the number of employees expected to increase from 1,200 to 1,650.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are very confident that in addition to our current customers, Land Rover and Chrysler, other automotive manufacturers will join in and benefit from the advantages of our 9HP,&amp;quot; said ZF chief executive officer Dr. Stefan Sommer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new transmission is specially designed for passenger cars with front-transverse engines. Compared to standard 6-speed automatic transmission, it can cut fuel consumption by up to 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Since around three quarters of all passenger cars worldwide are fitted with this drive configuration, I see great potential for our new product, especially in North America,&amp;quot; said Dr. Sommer.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Texas Gains 32,000 Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For the second year in a row, industrial employment in Texas posted a significant gain, according to the 2013 Texas Manufacturers Register published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Texas gained 32,680 manufacturing jobs from April 2012 to April 2013, which was more than double the gain for the 2011-2012 survey period and two percentage points above the national average gain as reported by the Labor Department. Texas is now home to 22,642 manufacturers employing 1.2 million workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Texas&amp;#39; industrial climate continues to improve,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s abundant natural resources, friendly business environment and ideal location for the shipment of goods continue to result in many companies investing in its manufacturing sector, particularly those in the oil and gas and electronics industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gains were spread across most sectors, with some of the largest increases seen in the state&amp;#39;s top industries by employment. Industrial machinery and equipment ranked first in the state for manufacturing employment with 175,592 jobs. Fabricated metals came in second with 120,680 manufacturing jobs, while oil and gas extraction accounted for 118,496 industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the state included Samsung&amp;#39;s expansion of its semiconductor plant in Austin, Motorola&amp;#39;s plans to open a new plant in Fort Worth, the opening of Caterpillar&amp;#39;s new excavator factory in Victoria, and chemical maker Kuraray America Inc.&amp;#39;s announcement it would expand facilities in LaPorte and Pasadena. In addition, Apple recently announced it would locate a new Macintosh assembly plant in the state, and pet-food maker Canidae established a new factory in Brownwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other sectors to gain jobs included instruments/related products, rubber/plastics, transportation equipment, primary metals, electronics and chemicals. Only two sectors posted notable losses: stone/clay/glass and printing/publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial locations announcing closures included Beef Products Inc., which shuttered a plant in Amarillo following the &amp;quot;pink slime&amp;quot; controversy, and BAE Systems&amp;#39; location in Irving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Houston remains Texas&amp;#39; and the nation&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment, with 249,934 industrial jobs, followed by Dallas with 71,361 jobs and Fort Worth with 64,960 jobs. San Antonio ranked fourth with 52,225 jobs, while Austin accounted for 47,620 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kansas Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Kansas increased 1.7 percent over the past year, according to the 2013 Kansas Manufacturers Directory published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Kansas gained 3,630 industrial jobs from April 2012 to April 2013, with the number of manufacturers operating in the state increasing by 74. Kansas is now home to 4,588 manufacturers employing 214,259 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Kansas&amp;#39; industrial climate continues to improve,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s friendly business environment and abundant natural resources have resulted in many companies reinvesting in its manufacturing sector, particularly those in the automotive and transportation equipment industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Transportation equipment ranks first in the state for the number of manufacturing jobs with 46,491 jobs. Food products manufacturing was second with 33,399 industrial jobs, while industrial machinery and equipment accounts for 25,884 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state saw a flurry of new and expanding transportation equipment facilities over the year, including GM and Ford, which announced plans to expand their assembly plants in Kansas City. Spirit Aerosystems also is expanding production at its facility in Wichita, while VT Hackney established a truck bodies production facility in Independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other bright spots included the opening of Metal Panels Inc.&amp;#39;s new production plant in Kansas City, E.C. Manufacturing&amp;#39;s plans to open a facility in Shawnee, and Zell-Metall&amp;#39;s announcement it would expand production and open a new plant in Lenexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional industrial sectors in Kansas posting employment gains included lumber/wood, fabricated metals, chemicals and stone/clay/glass. Losses were seen in textiles/apparel, printing/publishing, paper products and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing locations in Kansas that have announced closures over the past year included a Hostess plant in Emporia and Amcor Ltd.&amp;#39;s location in Lenexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Wichita remains the state&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment with 58,473 jobs, followed by Kansas City with 13,473 jobs. Lenexa ranked third with 10,346 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Develops Advanced Manufacturing Technology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. is developing a new form of manufacturing technology with the potential to reduce costs and delivery time for sheet metal parts needed in smaller quantities. The development is based on Ford Freeform Fabrication Technology (F3T), a unique manufacturing process developed at the Ford Research and Innovation Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project is part of a three-year, $7-million U.S. Department of Energy grant to advance next-generation, energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Five innovative manufacturing projects were awarded a total of $23.5 million by the Department of Energy in March to advance clean manufacturing and help U.S. companies increase their competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The F3T sheet metal forming process is one of many advanced manufacturing technologies under development at Ford,&amp;quot; said Randy Visintainer, director of Ford Research and Innovation. &amp;quot;We developed this process during the past four years for small-scale applications in a laboratory setting, and the DOE award enables us to scale the process for larger applications and a full prove-out for manufacturing feasibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the process, a piece of sheet metal is clamped around its edges and formed into a 3-D shape by two stylus-type tools working in unison on opposite sides of the sheet metal blank. After the CAD data of a part are received, computer-generated tool paths control the F3T machine to form the sheet metal part into its final shape to the required dimensional tolerances and surface finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, traditional stamping processes are energy-intensive, often taking several months for the first part to move from concept to production. While traditional processes remain the most efficient method for high-volume stamping, efficiencies for low-volume production can be achieved with the flexibility F3T provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Geometric-specific forming dies are completely eliminated with the process, along with the high cost and long lead time associated with die engineering, construction and machining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The technology aims to enable the delivery of a sheet metal part within three business days from the time the CAD model of the part is received. With the current technology, parts are delivered anywhere from two to six months using conventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once fully developed, F3T will help to improve the vehicle research and development process, allowing for more flexibility in quickly creating parts for prototypes and concept cars. Currently, creating a prototype die can take six to eight weeks, and developing a full prototype vehicle usually takes several months and up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. F3T could produce sheet metal parts for prototypes in just days for essentially no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, F3T has the potential to allow for greater personalization options, adding the ability for buyers to customize vehicle bodywork. F3T is also expected to have broad applications outside of the automotive industry, including use in the aerospace, defense, transportation and appliance industries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Caterpillar to Acquire Berg Propulsion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar Inc. recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Johan Walter Berg AB, including its core brand of Berg Propulsion, a leading manufacturer of mechanically and electrically driven propulsion systems and marine controls for ships. With the acquisition, Caterpillar will transition from selling only engines and generators to providing complete marine propulsion package systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in &amp;Ouml;cker&amp;ouml; Islands, Sweden, Berg has designed and manufactured heavy-duty marine thrusters and controllable pitch propellers since 1929. Its proprietary systems are employed in maritime applications throughout the world that require precise maneuvering and positioning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Berg is one of the most highly regarded brands in the marine industry,&amp;quot; said Tom Frake, Caterpillar vice president. &amp;quot;Our team will now be able to provide worldwide Caterpillar support to marine operators for a complete, optimized propulsion package, including bow thrusters, gearboxes and shaft alternators. In addition, Berg&amp;rsquo;s expertise, focus on maximizing customers&amp;rsquo; uptime and minimizing operation cost aligns well with Caterpillar&amp;rsquo;s value proposition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Berg will become part of the Caterpillar Marine and Petroleum Power Division, which supplies diesel and natural gas engines for the generation, control and supply of mechanical and electric power for the marine and petroleum industries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our company&amp;rsquo;s history and is a chance to become part of the strongest brands &amp;ndash; both Caterpillar and MaK &amp;ndash; in our industry,&amp;quot; said H&amp;aring;kan Svensson, Berg&amp;rsquo;s chief executive officer. &amp;quot;We look forward to developing and providing an even greater portfolio of products and services for ship owners around the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Berg&amp;rsquo;s thrusters, propellers and control systems will be rebranded as Caterpillar soon after the close of the deal, which is expected later in 2013, pending final regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mississippi Manufacturing Jobs Decline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Mississippi declined nearly one-half percent over the past year according to the 2013 Mississippi Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports Mississippi lost 1,048 manufacturing jobs from February 2012 to February 2013 and is now home to 2,839 manufacturing companies employing 169,977 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturers in Mississippi have yet to fully recover from the recession, and uncertainty surrounding defense contracts due to looming spending cuts has affected hiring,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, MNI&amp;#39;s president. &amp;quot;However, the state&amp;#39;s low business costs and abundant natural resources continue to be a draw for manufacturers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several manufacturing companies in Mississippi announced expansions over the year, including Nissan, which plans an expansion of its plant in Canton; Multicraft International, which expanded its auto components factory in Pelahatchie; and Signet Maritime, which plans to expand its shipbuilding operation in Port of Pascagoula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, sleep products manufacturer Comfort Revolution opened a new plant in Tishomingo County, GE Aviation established its second Mississippi facility in Ellisville, Dennen Steel broke ground on a new plant in Iuka, and Yokohama Tire announced plans to open a plant in West Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing locations announcing closures included Koppers Holdings&amp;rsquo; plant in Grenada and SemiSouth Laboratories in Starkville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Transportation equipment remains the state&amp;rsquo;s largest sector by manufacturing employment with 24,345 jobs. Second-ranked food products accounts for 21,751 manufacturing jobs, while industrial machinery and equipment saw employment decline by 3.6 percent to 18,693 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial sectors that reported losses over the year included textiles/apparel, instruments/related products, paper products, stone/clay/glass and electronics. Gains were seen in fabricated metals, printing/publishing, chemicals and rubber/plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Southeast Mississippi accounts for the most industrial employment in the state with 58,347 industrial jobs, while Northeast Mississippi ranks second with 47,591 industrial jobs. The Southwest region of the state is home to 37,099 industrial workers, and the Northwest is credited with 26,940 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the industrial directory, Pascagoula remains the state&amp;rsquo;s top city for industrial employment with 34 manufacturing companies employing 14,298 workers. Laurel was the second-ranked city and home to 7,388 jobs, while third-ranked Jackson accounts for 6,131 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>California Gains Manufacturing Jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in California increased slightly over the past year according to the 2013 Directory of California Manufacturers published by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports California gained 7,651 manufacturing jobs from February 2012 to February 2013 and is now home to 25,051 manufacturers employing 1,492,180 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With its abundant natural resources, California remains a prime state for green investment, and its access to capital and educated workforce have been a draw for a variety of enterprises,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;However, the state still has a long way to go in terms of lowering business costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Green manufacturing companies that announced openings included Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, which recently established an electric bus facility in Lancaster; battery maker Quallion, which opened a lithium-ion battery plant in Santa Clarita; and Soitec, which broke ground on a solar plant in San Diego. Other bright spots for the state included the opening of Paramount Citrus&amp;rsquo; new packing plant in Delano and the establishment of a CJ Foods factory in Fullerton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the industrial directory, the electronics sector ranks first in the state for industrial employment with 247,662 jobs. Food products ranks second with 169,361 manufacturing jobs, while industrial machinery accounts for 169,095 manufacturing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other sectors to gain jobs included chemicals/allied products, instruments/related products, fabricated metals and transportation equipment. Losses were seen in stone/clay/glass, lumber/wood, primary metals and printing/publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing locations in California that have announced closures include a SVTC Technologies location in San Jose and Sanyo Solar&amp;rsquo;s plant in Carson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Northern California accounted for most of the state&amp;rsquo;s employment gains, with jobs up 1.7 percent in the region. Northern California currently is home to 561,793 industrial workers. Southern California accounts for 930,387 jobs, with employment virtually unchanged over the survey period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Los Angeles remains California&amp;rsquo;s top city for manufacturing employment with 75,650 jobs. San Diego ranks second with 71,239 jobs, while San Jose accounts for 60,638 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AGCO to Expand Minnesota Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AGCO recently announced a $42-million expansion of its manufacturing center in Jackson, Minn., which will increase production capacity and efficiency in order to help meet growing demand for its tractors and application equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The three-year endeavor is made up of seven phases affecting all areas of the facility, including component manufacturing, the tractor assembly line and the application equipment assembly line. Once completed, the expansion will create 75 additional permanent jobs at the plant, bringing the total number of employees to more than 1,200. The project will increase production capacity by 25 percent for both the tractor and sprayer assembly lines while maintaining best-in-class product quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first phase, which is scheduled to be completed in 2013, includes a 30,000-square-foot expansion of the component manufacturing area. This will increase capacity by 20 percent and improve efficiency by re-engineering the flow of materials to assembly stations. The installation of an additional robotic welder and a sheet laser will improve productivity and positively impact all equipment built in Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This expansion builds on the excitement that began in 2011 when AGCO chose Jackson as the location where high-horsepower wheeled tractors for North America would be built,&amp;rdquo; said Eric Fisher, AGCO&amp;#39;s director of operations. &amp;quot;Continuing to invest here reinforces AGCO&amp;#39;s commitment to bringing our North American customers high-quality tractors and application equipment built how the customer wants them and delivered on time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remaining phases include expanding the tractor assembly line for increased production capacity, an in-line paint system for the application assembly line and cutting-edge testing capability of finished products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturers Expecting Continued Growth</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The level of optimism among manufacturing executives about financial prospects has increased from a year ago, according to Prime Advantage&amp;rsquo;s recent survey of chief financial officers. The report, which includes the top financial projections and concerns of member companies, revealed widespread expectations of growth in 2013, with 96 percent believing U.S. manufacturing will expand or stay the same this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When asked to cite the top potential threats to economic growth in the United States, executives named healthcare reform, the U.S. budget deficit and European fiscal conditions as the biggest hurdles to the growth and stability of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To address current economic conditions, U.S. manufacturers would support simplification of the business tax (91 percent), balancing the U.S. budget (78 percent) and reducing regulations (72 percent) as the most desired government actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As companies actively explore new markets, they are also increasing investment in research and development. Fifty percent of Prime Advantage&amp;rsquo;s member companies are planning to increase their spending for new product development, the highest percentage since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cutting operational costs and developing new products and services, which were the top priorities of 2012, retained their positions for 2013. However, long-term strategic planning was replaced by seeking new markets for products and services, which moved 29 points up to the third position from the seventh position it occupied in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More companies than a year ago are planning to increase the number of domestic employees in 2013, as indicated by 49 percent of respondents (up from 41 percent in 2012). Three in four companies are planning to increase wages and salaries this year.&amp;nbsp;This is in contrast to 2011, when 72 percent of companies expected to add employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet, companies are still struggling to find skilled labor. Seventy percent of respondents indicated that the low level of skilled employees in the area is the main reason for difficulties in filling positions. Sixty percent of companies that were actively hiring indicated they had open positions for which they were having difficulty finding qualified labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nearly half of U.S. manufacturers (46 percent) indicated they engaged with local educational providers in order to train workers (up from 19 percent in 2012). Other short-term solutions to these challenges are setting up training for new employees (63 percent) as well as retraining existing employees (58 percent).&amp;nbsp;As a long-term solution, companies indicated working with local economic development and government leaders, increasing funding for vocational education options, getting more involved with the K-12 program, and developing better training programs in manufacturing and technical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	External concerns facing U.S. manufacturers for the most part remained the same. One in three companies named customer demand as the top external concern, while two in three companies included it in their top three concerns. Price pressure from competitors was the second leading concern, selected by 61 percent of manufacturers. The cost of non-fuel commodities, a long-time third concern, was replaced by the federal government agenda, selected by 36 percent of manufacturers (up from 21 percent in 2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ability to maintain margins, the chief internal concern of 2012 and 2010, retained its top position again, selected by 71 percent of respondents. The cost of healthcare, the leading concern of 2011, has moved up to second place, as 55 percent of respondents have included it in their top three concerns, up from 38 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re very encouraged to see our members&amp;rsquo; optimism regarding business for 2013,&amp;quot; said Louise O&amp;#39;Sullivan, president and CEO of Prime Advantage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;To see continued growth in revenue, capital expenditures and hiring expectations, following a record-setting 2012 for many, is a true indication of a solid manufacturing economy.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Prime Advantage CFO survey was conducted in March and April of 2013. It included a cross section of financial executives from member companies consisting of industrial manufacturing firms representing more than 25 different industries with annual revenues ranging between $10 million and $4 billion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Expands Kentucky Plant to Build Lexus ES 350</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota recently announced that its Lexus ES 350 will be assembled at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., starting in 2015, which will mark the first time a Lexus vehicle will be produced in the United States. To support the new dedicated assembly line, Toyota will invest $360 million in the Georgetown plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Approximately 50,000 Lexus vehicles a year will be produced, bringing the plant&amp;rsquo;s total annual production capacity to more than 550,000 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Lexus was founded in the United States, so it is only fitting that we are bringing the production of luxury sedans for our U.S. customers back to where the brand was born,&amp;quot; said Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation. &amp;quot;Today&amp;#39;s announcement is a major step in our global vision to make ever better cars and trucks, give regions greater autonomy to make the products their customers want and achieve sustainable growth globally.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production of the ES 350 at the Georgetown plant is the latest step in Toyota&amp;rsquo;s continuing strategy to assemble vehicles in the markets where its customers live. Over the past 17 months, the company has announced plans to increase production capacity at its plants in Mississippi, Indiana, West Virginia and Canada, reflecting a cumulative investment of approximately $2 billion that has created more than 4,000 new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Established in January 1986, Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky (TMMK) is Toyota&amp;rsquo;s largest manufacturing facility outside of Japan, employing approximately 6,600 people. The plant currently assembles the Toyota Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid and Venza and manufactures 4-cylinder and V-6 engines. It has earned 10 Initial Quality Plant Awards from J.D. Power and Associates, including four gold J.D. Power Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2012, the plant produced the 25 millionth Toyota vehicle built in North America. Toyota recently committed to boosting production capacity for the 4-cylinder engine at the plant by more than 100,000 units. This $30-million project will create about 80 new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The decision to move ES 350 production to Kentucky is a true tribute to the hard work and commitment to excellence of every single Toyota team member at this plant,&amp;quot; said TMMK president Wil James. &amp;quot;We deeply appreciate the tremendous support we have received from our community, from our local suppliers and business partners, and from Governor Beshear and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We look forward to strengthening further the productive partnership we have built together over the last 25 years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ES is Lexus&amp;rsquo;s best-selling sedan with approximately 58,850 vehicles sold in North America in 2012, including 56,158 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>North Carolina Manufacturing Jobs Increase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in North Carolina rose 1.3 percent in 2012 according to the 2013 North Carolina Manufacturers Register published by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. (MNI). MNI reports North Carolina gained 7,319 manufacturing jobs from January 2012 to January 2013, the first notable gain recorded for the state in nearly a decade, and is now home to 10,208 manufacturers employing 565,784 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing sector continues to improve,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of MNI. &amp;quot;The state&amp;#39;s educated workforce, low business costs and its reputation as a center for innovation continue to be a draw for new business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several manufacturing companies have announced openings and expansions in North Carolina including computer giant Lenovo, which plans to locate its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Whitsett, and Herbalife, which expects to open a facility in Winston Salem&amp;rsquo;s previously shuttered Dell facility. Ashley Furniture will also break ground on a new plant in Davie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing locations in North Carolina that have announced closures included Gold Signature Foods in Monroe, Rock-Tenn in Shelby, Protective Products Enterprises in St. Pauls and TT Electronics in Boone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Textiles/apparel, which historically has been North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s largest sector by manufacturing employment, now accounts for 60,701 jobs, second to industrial machinery and equipment, which ranks first in the state at 64,262 jobs. Employment in food products currently accounts for 59,059 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other sectors to gain jobs included instruments/related products, transportation equipment, chemicals, electronics and furniture/fixtures. Losses were seen in primary metals, lumber/wood, printing/publishing, paper products and stone/clay/glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;rsquo;s city data shows Charlotte remains North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s top city for manufacturing employment with 43,160 jobs. Greensboro ranks second with 29,817 jobs, while Research Triangle Park accounts for 21,484 industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken Completes Plant Upgrades</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Co. recently announced the completion of three capital-investment projects totaling $85 million. The steel business investments include an open-die in-line forge press at the Faircrest Steel Plant in Canton, Ohio, along with an intermediate finishing line and a second induction thermal treatment line at the Gambrinus Steel Plant, which is also in Canton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 3,300-ton forge press offers Timken and its customers sound-center engineered steel bars that can unlock new market opportunities and operating efficiencies. The forge press uses an innovative large-bar forged-rolled process, which Timken developed and installed to enhance center soundness of a larger cross-section of Timken special bar quality steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The forge press opens new market spaces for customers and Timken, providing particular value where performance in extreme operating conditions is of critical importance,&amp;quot; said Timken&amp;rsquo;s Rich Kyle. &amp;quot;Adding this forging step prior to rolling further improves bar soundness. The forge press also contributes substantially to our long-term competitiveness by bringing greater differentiation and expanded capacity for high-quality Timken products to customers worldwide.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new intermediate finishing line increases operational efficiencies by incorporating the latest technologies and employing lean processes, significantly eliminating product touches and material movements. The line advances testing quality, reduces processing times and incorporates an environmentally friendly water jet descaling spray system that replaces the former pickling process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second induction thermal treatment line introduces about 40,000 tons of normalized thermal-treat capacity for customers annually. Used in conjunction with current thermal-treat assets, the line helps increase quench and temper capacity by 20,000 tons per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The intermediate finishing and induction thermal treatment lines improve manufacturing effectiveness and underscore a long-standing commitment to advance our capabilities,&amp;quot; Kyle added. &amp;quot;With customers foremost in mind, we are investing more than $500 million in our Ohio steel plants to help us meet their needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Construction continues on schedule at the Faircrest Steel Plant for two other significant investment projects. A second ladle refining station will begin production in the second quarter of 2013, and a vertical jumbo bloom continuous caster is slated to be operational the second half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
