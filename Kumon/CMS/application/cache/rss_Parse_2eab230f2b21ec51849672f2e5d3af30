            <title>OSHA Cites Pennsylvania Manufacturer After Deadly Explosion </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently issued eight serious citations and one other-than-serious citation to Titanium Metals Corp. (TIMET) after determining that an improperly equipped furnace led to a deadly explosion at the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing plant in Morgantown, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 27-year-old furnace worker was killed in the explosion when a boiler lid flew off inside the titanium manufacturing plant. The lid, which was 20 feet in diameter, struck Jacob Lopez and injured three other employees in the incident. OSHA found that the electron beam furnace was not equipped with the proper vacuum/pressure gauge to detect and prevent the buildup of hydrogen gas, which could have prevented the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;TIMET&amp;#39;s electron beam furnace system had a history of problems, including an incident that occurred about a month prior to the fatal March explosion that significantly damaged the equipment,&amp;quot; said Kevin Kilp, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Harrisburg area office. &amp;quot;The employer clearly knew the potential for serious harm existed but chose to do nothing. This resulted in damage to the facility and, tragically, the death of Jacob Lopez.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The general duty clause citations included the furnace violation and storage racks not fastened properly to the floor. OSHA also cited TIMET for serious violations, which included unguarded machinery, unmaintained exit routes and electrical hazards. The other-than-serious citation was due to an obstructed exit sign. Proposed penalties total $42,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TIMET, which supplies nearly one-fifth of the world&amp;#39;s titanium, produces mill and melted titanium products at facilities in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA Announces Top 10 Safety Violations for 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently announced the top 10 most frequently cited workplace safety violations at the 2015 National Safety Council Congress and Expo in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once again, fall protection topped the list with 6,721 violations. Hazard communication was second on the list of top violations, followed by scaffolding, respiratory protection, lockout/tagout, powered industrial trucks and ladders. Rounding out the top 10 were electrical/wiring methods, machine guarding and electrical/general requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In injury prevention, we go where the data tell us to go,&amp;quot; said National Safety Council president and CEO Deborah Hersman. &amp;quot;The OSHA Top 10 list is a roadmap that identifies the hazards you want to avoid on the journey to safety excellence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The preliminary figures for the 2015 fiscal year are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fall Protection &amp;ndash; 6,721 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hazard Communication &amp;ndash; 5,192 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scaffolding &amp;ndash; 4,295 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Respiratory Protection &amp;ndash; 3,305 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lockout/Tagout &amp;ndash; 3,002 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Powered Industrial Trucks &amp;ndash; 2,760 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ladders &amp;ndash; 2,489 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electrical, Wiring Methods &amp;ndash; 2,404 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machine Guarding &amp;ndash; 2,295 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electrical, General Requirements &amp;ndash; 1,973 Violations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final report on the top 10 violations for 2015 will be published in the December edition of &lt;em&gt;Safety+Health&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Things Every Warehouse Should Have</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/8/19/0bc2e8aa-415d-4525-9a2c-e0ed350fac88_warehouse-safety.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 327px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Every day warehouse workers are exposed to unique hazards, including falls from dangerous heights or varying severity of injuries caused by the misuse of heavy machinery. The list of potential accidents is many, and as a result, warehouses have come to be known as one of the most hazardous work environments. However, adequate safety measures are available to ensure your workers steer clear of danger. Below are five crucial safety items that should be used in your warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Labels and Signage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Warehouse employees can more effectively protect themselves if they know exactly what they are working with. Everything in your warehouse, from machinery to crates, should be clearly identified. Labels should indicate the contents of a box, its destination and any other useful warnings. Some labels indicate appropriate storage temperatures or provide safe handling instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Likewise, every area of your warehouse should be identified with proper signage. Signs should indicate who does and does not have access as well as communicate where smoking is or is not permitted. Vehicle traffic should be clearly designated along with warnings concerning flammable and/or hazardous materials. Directional signage should denote fire exits and help to locate fire extinguishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Guard Rails and Anti-Slip Tape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Falls are relatively common in a warehouse. Employees can fall from lifting equipment or from high storage ledges. With so much open space and elevated storage, workers must be protected against falls of all kinds. A warehouse should be thoroughly inspected for potentially dangerous areas that put employees at risk so those areas can be properly labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as important are the barriers that physically prevent workers from falling. Guard rails are a primary piece of safety equipment that can save lives. They should be placed in any area of your facility where falling is a risk. A similar cause of injury is slipping. Be sure that stairs, ledges and inclines are lined with anti-slip tape. Also, use safety mats for an additional measure of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Personal Safety Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Warehouse employees should be well-protected from head to toe. They should be safe from impact, and in some instances, protected against chemical burns. Personal safety equipment can and in many cases should include helmets, face shields, eyewear, ear protection, respiratory protection, gloves, vests and kneepads. General ergonomics is also important for workers responsible for moving heavy loads and operating heavy machinery. Industrial floor mats with impact-absorbing features can reduce the strain on warehouse employees&amp;#39; knees, ankles and shins. All workers should also be trained in proper lifting that does not put undue pressure on their backs. Give employees the freedom to seek assistance when needed, and be alert to their endurance limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Lockout/Tagout Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is becoming more common for all industrial workplaces &amp;mdash; warehouses included &amp;mdash; to utilize lockout/tagout systems and policies. Lockout/tagout refers to safe practices that allow a machine to be disabled when needed in order to prevent unwanted access. Various lockout/tagout products, such as group lockout devices, block access to electrical equipment. Many devices effectively stop a machine from starting in the first place so machinery can be safely serviced. The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) outlines several steps a warehouse can take to fully comply with lockout/tagout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. First-Aid Kit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All workplaces should be equipped with a comprehensive first-aid kit, and warehouses certainly are no exception. Because of the greater likelihood of workplace injuries in warehouses, it is recommended that these facilities have multiple kits and that they be easily accessible. Considering the size of some warehouses, the kits should also be portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your first-aid kit should include a wide range of equipment, such as bandages, adhesive tape, pads, ammonia inhalants, a cold pack, antiseptic wipes, eye wash, aspirin, burn spray, cotton applicators, gloves, scissors and tweezers. Of course, each kit should also have thorough user instructions. As a precaution, employees should familiarize themselves with the contents of the kit and know how to use it. Similarly, they should know when to alert an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Utility Trailer Plant Earns Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/8/13/e701e630-99c8-4250-8316-c2ea93a3b82f_Utility_Glade_Spring_Plant_Safety_Award-small.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 297px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Utility Trailer Manufacturing Co. recently announced that its plant in Glade Spring, Virginia, has received the Liberty Mutual Insurance Gold Safety Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This marks the plant&amp;#39;s third Liberty Safety Award but first Gold Award. It also is only the second Gold Award ever given by Liberty to Utility Trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Liberty Mutual&amp;#39;s Safety Awards are based on the days away, restricted and transferred (DART) rate, which is calculated from the number of hours worked relative to the number of accidents at the plant. Lower numbers of accidents result in lower DART rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To qualify for the Gold Safety Award, the plant&amp;#39;s DART rate must be at least 80 percent better than the trailer manufacturing industry&amp;#39;s average DART of 4.2, with a minimum of 200,000 work-hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2014, the Glade Spring plant achieved a 0.84 DART rate, which not only was 80 percent better than the industry average but also continued a multi-year trend of decreasing DART rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is another significant milestone,&amp;quot; said Bob Griffis, corporate environmental health and safety manager for Utility Trailer Manufacturing. &amp;quot;We couldn&amp;#39;t have achieved this award without the continuous focus by our employees on safety and without the quality medical care provided to our employees by our local doctors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>KBR Achieves Safety Milestone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	KBR Inc. recently announced that it has surpassed 3 million work hours without a lost-time incident at the Dyno Nobel ammonia plant construction site in Waggaman, Louisiana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although this is not the first such achievement for KBR, the logistical and schedule challenges associated with this particular project make it a significant milestone demonstrating the company&amp;#39;s commitment to zero harm to people, property and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;KBR fosters an interdependent safety culture in which all employees are expected to make safety-conscious decisions that are governed by personal values,&amp;quot; said Nick Anagnostou, KBR&amp;#39;s vice president of health, safety, security and the environment. &amp;quot;Everyone truly realizes that an injury incident is not a statistic but rather a person who has been negatively affected.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every new KBR employee receives rigorous training on the zero-harm safety culture, which emphasizes the importance of an incident-free work environment. Peer-to-peer intervention is also embraced across the organization for all safety-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the Dyno Nobel site, KBR&amp;#39;s commitment to zero harm is reinforced with daily and weekly site meetings, toolbox safety meetings and award recognition for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have made zero harm the foundation of our corporate values,&amp;quot; said Stuart Bradie, KBR president and CEO. &amp;quot;KBR makes it a priority to see our employees go home safely on a daily basis, and it is our responsibility to provide a working environment that empowers all employees to speak up about safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A global technology, engineering, procurement and construction company serving the hydrocarbons and government services industries, KBR employs approximately 25,000 people worldwide with customers in more than 70 countries and operations in 40 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>4 Overlooked Workplace Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/8/5/6fca9a57-6c8f-4920-b840-5138494caed5_hazards.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 432px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Working in the material handling industry can sometimes place employees in potentially dangerous situations. Safety awareness is paramount in mitigating risks to workers, products and the facility. Reducing the chance of peril is the paragon of effective workplace habits. However, there are a handful of simple steps you can take to decrease the likelihood of a hazardous scenario. Following are four of the most overlooked workplace hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Not Being Aware of Surroundings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is critical that employees pay attention to their surroundings at all times. Maintain a 360-degree perspective of all activities and operations, and be mindful of vehicular traffic in and around the premises. Distractions can easily impede any operation. For this reason, workers should focus their attention at all times on the task at hand. This is especially true when handling hazardous materials, dangerous substances or heavy goods that can potentially injure or kill someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Lack of Hydraulic Fluid in Forklifts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hydraulic oil allows a forklift to raise and lower its lift platforms. To assure proper operation and prevent accidents during usage, it is important to routinely check the hydraulic fluid. In many instances, the fast-paced environments that often accompany forklift operation make this task seem counterproductive to efficiency and productivity goals. However, bubbly hydraulic oil or inadequate amounts can result in an immediate failure of the mechanisms and pose a threat to the safety and welfare of employees. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Improper Handling of Unsafe Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before handling any potentially volatile substance, be sure to use personal protective equipment and dress appropriately. Learning placard codes can also be a great asset to workers trying to determine the class of materials they are handling. Improperly handling these materials can result in a spill or contamination of the premises, the results of which can be devastating. By assuring proper handling of unsafe materials and adherence to all safety protocols, you can reduce the likelihood of a serious incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Dehydration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This hazard may be the most dangerous of all. Dehydrated workers are more likely to improperly handle materials and less likely to be aware of their surroundings. In addition, dehydrated workers are at high risk for heat stroke or cardiac-related complications. The severity of this situation can be exceptionally grave and ultimately place co-workers at risk as well. The tragedy of this is that dehydration can be easily prevented. Take frequent breaks and drink 12 ounces of water on those hot summer days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/QAc4qIULOPk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA Cites Missouri Manufacturer After Worker's Death</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently cited Ridewell Corp. of Springfield, Missouri, for safety violations following the death of a 62-year-old parts assembler who died after he was struck by a 4-pound metal spacer that flew off a 4-ton hydraulic press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An investigation of the vehicle suspension systems manufacturer found the worker received multiple broken bones and internal injuries in the January incident. He had been employed at the company for 31 years. Inspectors determined that the machine he was working on lacked required safety mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This tragic loss could have been prevented,&amp;quot; said Barbara Theriot, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Kansas City. &amp;quot;Ridewell workers are at risk for life-threatening hazards every time machinery is operated because this company chooses not to keep them safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA cited Ridewell for one willful and one additional safety violation. The willful violation was assessed for failing to protect workers from operating parts of machinery. The company also failed to provide the requested First Report of Injury document within the required 4-hour timeline, resulting in one other-than-serious violation. OSHA has proposed penalties of $71,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ridewell has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Kansas City or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>4 Industrial Hazards That Can be Reduced with Safety Training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/7/8/e838bc99-c7cb-4e75-b39a-ba0231708739_danger.jpeg" style="width: 301px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Blue-collar workers, technicians and trades along with the construction and mining industries have the highest risks when it comes to industrial hazards, but this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that other occupations are safe from harm&amp;#39;s way. From open wounds and fractures to strains, physical injuries and falls, the type and severity of injuries suffered in any workplace can vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While there&amp;#39;s no magic cure to completely eliminate risks from industrial hazards, there are strict health and safety measures that can be taken to reduce them. With the right knowledge and proper safety training, the severity of workplace injuries can be lessened as well as the effects on the involved staff. Following are four hazards that can be minimized with safety training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1. Falls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Falling from heights is one of the biggest threats in the workplace. Each year, falls account for the greatest number of fatalities, especially in the construction and mining industries. The most common factors involving falls are misuse of fall-protection equipment (or no use at all), human error and unstable working surfaces. Using the correct safety equipment offers the best solution for this type of hazard. Safety-net systems, fall-arrest systems and restraint systems can help prevent a number of deaths and injuries. Warning signs and control-line systems should also be in place to alert workers near edges. Also, make certain that all relevant staff are trained to recognize the risks and to use height safety equipment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2. Incorrect Machine Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using equipment in the workplace and servicing machines on the job make up a large percentage of workplace injuries and fatalities. Raising industry awareness to ensure all machinery is utilized properly is one of the most crucial steps in preventing these injuries. Working with heavy-duty equipment like forklifts and elevated platforms requires extensive training to safely operate or assess the risks involved. The right equipment training can also help certify that personnel have the necessary permits before using or servicing any machines as well as provide confidence for workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other safety measures to prevent injuries include performing regular risk assessments on the machinery and verifying that all staff are aware of the risks involved, know what to do should something happen and understand the importance of replacing faulty machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3. Physical Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Physical injuries such as back strains, sprains and fractures are extremely common risks regardless of your workplace. Poor work practices and a lack of risk assessments can create such hazards, so the right training for the job is essential. Physical injuries can be prevented by learning to lift properly, using protective equipment and reducing the stress on your body by knowing your limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By obtaining health and safety training suitable for your workplace and job, you&amp;#39;ll have a better understanding of how to assess risks. Once a risk can be assessed effectively, safety measures can be put into place to reduce the risk or eliminate it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. Medical Emergencies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impact of minor cuts and bruises to more serious threats and medical emergencies can be minimized by having at least one staff member who is confident and trained to perform first-aid. This can be critical when waiting for an ambulance to arrive at the scene. A variety of first-aid courses are available, covering basic preventive measures to more comprehensive procedures. At the bare minimum, your staff should have a basic understanding of first-aid. In higher risk-prone work industries, it may be necessary to have two first-aid personnel who can perform CPR, assess risk and keep the patient stable until further help arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Greenwood Receives Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/26/c6f1602b-4ac0-4429-ba3c-692008b06a37_GreenWood Inc - BB&amp;amp;T Lighthouse Beam Safety Award.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 253px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Greenwood Inc. was recently presented with the Lighthouse Beam Safety Award by BB&amp;amp;T Insurance Services.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Getting Employees to Take Ownership of Safety Policies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/18/e6a33eac-a455-448d-b1db-58a0f203ee16_for-web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 310px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;As an employer in an industry that could be considered risky, you want to hire employees who are as diligent about safety precautions as you are. Consider your staff as your first line of defense. Train them to keep an eye out for potential safety issues so they can be addressed before becoming dangerous problems. By paying attention to details and training your employees efficiently, you can ensure that your staff will know safety procedures like the back of their hands. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Training Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training is an ongoing procedure that must adapt to changing work conditions and present new scenarios to your employees. Don&amp;rsquo;t just consider this a chance to review current safety policies as a refresher. Challenge your staff to bring their ideas to the table. Create example safety problems and ask your employees how they would handle different situations. This will help you discover what needs to be reviewed and may spark new safety policy ideas. Keep in mind that while under stress, some personnel may feel unprepared in certain situations. By having them voice how they would handle a particular scenario, you&amp;rsquo;re getting them to actively participate and consciously think of how they would address a dangerous situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Minimize Outside Risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If your staff is working in an area where external risks are a factor, ensure that you are training them in taking the necessary precautions. Employees should understand what needs to be done in order to work efficiently while activity is going on around the worksite. In construction, for example, you must be sure that personnel can secure the work zone to prevent pedestrian accidents or automobile traffic. If you are dealing with curious onlookers, which can be distracting, encourage your staff to look at privacy as a safety precaution to follow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Give Employees Hands-on Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the best ways to get employees to become safety experts is to give them a hands-on role in safety policies. Involve them in workplace inspections so they can learn firsthand why a specific safety procedure is in place. Have them observe safety procedures to understand what a proper technique looks like and identify where problems may arise. Encourage them to talk with their coworkers about their findings to see what they&amp;rsquo;ve learned and answer any questions they may have. Ask your staff if there is a certain safety procedure in which they would like to be involved or a policy in which they aren&amp;rsquo;t entirely confident. By initiating this discussion, you&amp;rsquo;re gaining insight into what your employees&amp;rsquo; strengths and weaknesses are in terms of safety policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to workplace safety, it&amp;rsquo;s always better to take pre-emptive measures rather than address concerns when they develop into serious problems. By properly training your staff and applying these principles rather than reading through a rulebook, you will give your employees the opportunity to become safety experts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DuPont Cited for Safety Violations After Workers' Deaths</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently cited DuPont for 11 safety violations and identified a number of safety upgrades the company must undertake to prevent future accidents at its Lannate/API manufacturing building in La Porte, Texas, after four workers were killed by a lethal gas in November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Four people lost their lives, and their families lost loved ones because DuPont did not have proper safety procedures in place,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;quot;Had the company assessed the dangers involved or trained their employees on what to do if the ventilation system stopped working, they might have had a chance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fatal incident occurred as one worker was overwhelmed when methyl mercaptan gas was unexpectedly released when she opened a drain on a methyl mercaptan vent line. Two co-workers who came to her aid were also overcome. None of the three wore protective respirators. A fourth co-worker &amp;ndash; the brother of one of the fallen men &amp;ndash; attempted a rescue but was unsuccessful. All four people died in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Methyl mercaptan is a colorless gas with a strong odor. It is used in pesticides, jet fuels and plastics. At dangerous levels of exposure, the gas depresses the central nervous system and affects the respiratory center, producing death by respiratory paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont was cited for one repeat, nine serious and one other than serious OSHA violations. The repeat violation was assessed for not training employees on using the building&amp;#39;s ventilation system and other safety procedures, such as how to respond if the fans stopped working. In July 2010, DuPont was cited for a similar violation. OSHA has fined the company $99,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Secure Your Worksite to Prevent Accidents</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/4/29/3d3a22ee-032d-4be5-bc47-425e008cfd82_temporary-fencing-panel.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 321px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;If you manage a construction site, warehouse, factory or plant, you are directly responsible for the safety of the people at the site, which means you&amp;#39;re under a lot of pressure to make sure you&amp;#39;ve taken every step at your disposal to prevent accidents. One of the easiest ways to reduce vulnerabilities is to secure your worksite. Here&amp;#39;s why you should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Discourage Theft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An unsecured worksite is as good as an invitation to would-be criminals. Expensive scrap metal, equipment and other valuables may be exposed if you haven&amp;#39;t considered site security. Once intruders are on your property, they can create unsafe situations unintentionally by moving or removing essential equipment. They also put themselves at risk, since they are less likely to know the worksite and aren&amp;#39;t paying attention to safety protocol (and yes, you can still be liable for accidents on your property even if an intruder isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be there). By hiring paid security guards to watch the site during off hours, you can reduce the chances that you will be the victim of such an incident. Additionally, installing fencing around the site can block the view into the worksite, obscuring valuables and discouraging theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduce Slip, Trip and Fall Hazards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though your worksite may not have valuables to steal, you could still be at risk for intrusion. Even seemingly inaccessible sites may be visited by unsupervised children or bored, risk-seeking teenagers. Even though they may not want to steal from your site or vandalize equipment, they are potentially endangering themselves by putting themselves in risky situations (climbing on equipment, ascending catwalks or ladders, entering high-voltage areas, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Prevent Tampering with Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once an unauthorized individual is on your worksite, he or she may have access to sensitive equipment or areas which, if tampered with, could create an unsafe situation. This may be through intentional vandalism or unintentional modification. By securing your worksite, you can reduce the risk that your equipment has been altered or damaged, thereby decreasing the danger that one of your employees is injured by an unexpected change to the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduce Risk of Violent Incidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hiring security is a good idea for both off hours and working hours. It may be cost-prohibitive for smaller worksites, but dedicated security can help ensure that you have professionals who are able to subdue violent people or defuse conflicts. You don&amp;#39;t want to have bystanders be responsible for dealing with a violent situation if you can help it. This could also be relevant for both distressed employees and unwelcome or unruly visitors. It is always better to be safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Protect Yourself from Financial Accidents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned previously, an organization has a responsibility to prevent accidents by removing unsafe situations. Securing a worksite is one way to do this. Your responsibility can become a liability in the event of a preventable accident, which can mean financial losses in court on top of the harm that could befall people at your site. A settlement or award of damages could be devastatingly expensive, especially for a small to mid-sized company. Don&amp;#39;t get caught off-guard. Make sure you&amp;#39;ve done a thorough risk assessment of your worksite and considered every potential hazard when securing your location.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New Jersey Manufacturer Fined $56,000 for Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited EP Heller Co. of Madison, New Jersey, for two willful violations for failing to properly guard machinery to protect employees from possible amputations. Proposed penalties total $56,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;OSHA previously cited this company for the same amputation hazards involving the same machinery, yet it continues to jeopardize worker safety by not ensuring the proper safeguards are in place,&amp;quot; said Kris Hoffman, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Parsippany area office. &amp;quot;The proposed penalties in this case reflect the severe nature of the cited hazards. OSHA remains committed to holding companies legally accountable for failing to uphold their responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA inspectors also identified 11 serious violations for hazards including workers not medically evaluated, fit tested and trained on the respirators provided for protection against metal dust, as well as a lack of guarding on grinding machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EP Heller Co., which manufactures and services carbide steel cutting tools, has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA Fines Idaho Steel Manufacturer for Serious Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ernesto Paramo never knew his shift on August 4 would be his last, leaving his family and friends to grieve his untimely death. The 30-year-old welder clocked in as he had many times before and then went to work at Superior Steel Products Inc. Paramo was in an unsecured basket raised improperly on a forklift about 9 feet off the floor when the basket fell off a forklift onto the concrete floor below. Sadly, Paramo is not alone. In the past year, nearly one in four Idaho workplace fatalities were a result of improper forklift use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) found Superior Steel did not protect employees from numerous hazards related to the use of forklifts, including training, modifications and operation. Investigators also discovered confined space, flammable liquid and respiratory hazards. OSHA has proposed fines of $38,780 for these violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We send our condolences to the family and friends of Ernesto Paramo,&amp;quot; said Galen Blanton, acting OSHA regional administrator in Seattle. &amp;quot;They lost someone they loved because Superior Steel Products did not ensure basic safety procedures for dangerous heavy equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s Boise area office has developed a local emphasis program for the powered industrial trucks enforcement program to target many of the hazards found during their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Caldwell, Idaho, Superior Steel Products is a manufacturer of steel and aluminum storage tanks, such as crude oil tankers, aviation fuel storage, fuel transportation tanks, fertilizer storage tanks and chemical transportation tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA Cites Cleveland Plant Following Machine Operator's Death</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A 45-year-old machine operator was fatally crushed while he adjusted a set screw on a rolling mill at the Cleveland Track Material facility on Aug. 21, 2014. The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation found workers were exposed to dangerous rotating machinery parts at the plant that rolls steel for railroad industry use. Seven serious violations have been issued as a result of the investigation, with proposed fines totaling $49,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A son lost his father, and a wife lost her husband,&amp;quot; said Howard Eberts, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Cleveland. &amp;quot;This tragedy could have been prevented had the employer implemented basic safety precautions associated with dangerous machinery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s inspection found that the lead rolling mill operator, who had been employed at Cleveland Track Material for 16 years, came in contact with a spinning shaft. He suffered fatal blunt force trauma and injuries related to crushing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company failed to ensure the worker was protected against contact with rotating parts, chains and sprockets and that machines were properly guarded and locked out prior to maintenance. Additionally, employees were inadequately trained on these procedures. These violations are among the most frequently cited by OSHA at manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An OSHA violation is considered serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A subsidiary of Vossloh North America, Cleveland Track Material is based in Reading, Pennsylvania. The company employs approximately 250 workers at manufacturing facilities in Cleveland, Reading and Memphis, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cleveland Track Material has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Important Safety Tips for Wastewater Treatment Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/12/3/aa19ee93-668c-4fa6-95b9-454b4fd25c27_water treatment plant for web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 219px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Being a plant manager at a wastewater treatment center is an enormous responsibility. You answer to many higher authorities besides your direct boss. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) might even know you by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plant managers not only are responsible for preventing health hazards to the public, but they must also protect their employees. This is a daunting task in any industry, but for wastewater managers, they get to do it surrounded by sewage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some simple tips to keep your safety plan up to date and effective in these demanding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Standard Safety Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper maintenance of machinery and equipment is a necessity. If your equipment fails, not only is it unsafe, but your facility is down for the count. Instead of thinking of your maintenance staff as repairmen, think of them as repair preventers. The best maintenance is done before something goes wrong. This lessens the safety hazards that arise when equipment malfunctions or breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper maintenance requires organization and planning. All pipes and electrical systems must be labeled appropriately. This includes identifying intake and outlet pipes and any equipment that presents an electrical flash hazard. If workers must perform repairs near live equipment, make sure they have the appropriate tools and protective gear and know how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employees are often required to work on catwalks high above open pits. Ensure all railings are adequate to prevent falls. If workers must perform their duties in unguarded areas, fall protection is required for any work 6 feet above the ground or a lower level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employees should also follow any&amp;nbsp;confined-space entry requirements set by OSHA. Confined spaces are areas that an employee can enter, have restricted exit and entry, and are not designed for continuous work. Warnings must be prominently placed in any hazard zones. Barricades should be set to prevent unauthorized entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Unique Hazards of a Wastewater Treatment Plant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vats at your plant do not look or smell like a swimming pool. You do not want anyone, including yourself, to end up falling in. Unfortunately, this is always a possibility. The first step you need to take for safety is to use non-slip surfaces around all vats and on all catwalks. Add additional traction tape, if necessary. All employees should also use slip-resistant footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have rescue devices readily available in the event someone does fall into a vat. Rescue hooks and floatation devices similar to those found at a public pool should be within easy reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All employees in your plant must understand the additional personal hygiene requirements. Frequent&amp;nbsp;hand washing with an anti-bacterial soap&amp;nbsp;is a good place to start. Any open cuts or skin abrasions should be covered with proper first-aid materials. Providing a location for employees to change after their shift is highly recommended. Work clothes should not be worn home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) also has guidelines that you must follow.&amp;nbsp;NFPA 820&amp;nbsp;specifically addresses hazards that wastewater treatment plants face. Make certain that you are familiar with these requirements for explosion and fire safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Dealing with Tour Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your wastewater plant is not the great American amusement park, but for some reason, everybody wants a tour. This often includes visitors from agencies that are not the least bit familiar with safety or a group of fourth graders on a science field trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You must assign one or more competent employees to guide visitors through your plant. This should include assigning a responsible party to stand by when outside contractors are performing maintenance or repairs. Keep all visitors well away from open pits and hazard areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health do not require mandatory vaccines for workers, your employees should consult with their own physicians for recommendations.

            <title>Ohio Plant Cited for Amputation Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Kronis Coatings Division of Jay Industries Inc. was recently cited by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for one repeat and four serious safety violations, including repeatedly exposing workers to amputation hazards from moving machinery parts during service and maintenance work. The proposed penalties total $62,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Kronis Coatings Division has continually exposed workers to dangerous moving machinery, which can cause life-altering injury, including amputation,&amp;quot; said Kim Nelson, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Toledo, Ohio. &amp;quot;When an employer is cited for repeat violations, it demonstrates that safety is not part of the company&amp;#39;s culture. That is unacceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA initiated an inspection on July 17, 2014, as a part of its Site-Specific Targeting Program, which focuses inspection efforts on employers in high injury and illness industries. Amputation hazards are among OSHA&amp;#39;s most frequently cited violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company was cited for failure to protect workers from moving machinery parts and other violations in 2012 and during the July 17 inspection. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, serious violations were cited for a lack of machine and tongue guarding, failure to adjust machinery properly and to test electrical personnel protective equipment as required. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Mansfield, Ohio, Kronis Coatings Division welds and powder coats metal automotive parts and employs 45 workers. Jay Industries, which employs about 1,000 workers companywide, operates five facilities in Mansfield and one each in Michigan, Illinois and Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Most Overlooked Warehouse Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/10/30/bd096230-d648-4ac9-bcc5-7d11c3e5f518_Warehouse.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 409px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Warehouses are full of undeniable hazards, with some more obvious than others. Typically, the major hazards are clearly identifiable and well-known. However, it is the lesser known dangers that can be the deadliest, especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are looking for. Below are a few common warehouse hazards that you and your staff should be careful not to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tripping, Slipping and Falling Hazards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tripping, slipping and falling hazards can be very dangerous because they are not always easy to spot. Take a puddle, for example. Even in a well-lit warehouse, liquid on the floor can be virtually invisible. Sawdust is another culprit that can go unnoticed. Similarly, a naturally slick surface, such as a buffed concrete floor, can result in a dangerous fall. Keep in mind that a fall does not have to be from a high position to be dangerous. Even a backward fall on a level surface can severely injure a person, especially if he or she is carrying something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cleanliness and awareness are crucial to prevent slips. Caution signs should be visible in working areas, and workers should be aware of the materials that are likely to be on the floor. Use guard railings in high locations, anti-slip tape on steps and ledges, and safety mats in problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Bodily Strain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bodily strain can be difficult to identify because each worker&amp;rsquo;s body type is different. You cannot always predict when a person will buckle under the pressure or how much prolonged exposure to labor will result in injury for a particular individual. Back and foot injuries are especially common in a warehouse setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Personal awareness is your best defense against these types of injuries. Employees should know their limits and have the freedom to alert a supervisor if they feel at risk. For injury prevention, all warehouse employees should be trained in proper lifting techniques. Investing in ergonomic equipment can also help relieve workers from the stress and strain of repetitive lifting, bending, twisting and stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Moving Machine Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even the most skilled machinist can grow complacent or careless over time. Many machines have moving components that can be dangerous if safety precautions are not implemented. For this reason, warning labels should be placed in strategic and prominent locations. Anyone in the vicinity of a heavy machine should know the specific risks. Warehouse staff should also understand the importance of heeding the cautions of all warning labels. Regular retraining can help remind staff to always be alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Storage and Racking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Storage and racking systems can also pose potential dangers. Even a properly stationed pallet rack does not guarantee that product will not fall from the shelves. Forklift collisions are common in warehouse settings, and as a result careful attention is required when moving in and out of aisles situated between pallet racks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once again, proper training will help to prevent accidents involving storage and racking systems. Only trained employees should have access to areas in the vicinity of these systems. Employees should also know the limits of the pallet racking systems to avoid overloading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Loading Docks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A loading dock is the site of the most traffic in your warehouse. Although it appears harmless, injuries in this location are prevalent. Typical loading dock injuries involve being pinned between a forklift and a dock or between the dock and a truck or trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traffic flow within the loading dock area is critical. Vehicle and foot traffic areas should be clearly labeled. Employees on the ground should be trained on the risks of not being seen by drivers. Drivers should also be attentive to the people around them. Be sure that your warehouse loading dock has adequate mirrors so that drivers can see everything in their vicinity. Finally, all loading dock workers should be dressed in attire that clearly alerts others to their presence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Janesville Acoustics Plant Sets New Safety Record</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Janesville Acoustics&amp;#39; plant in Old Fort, North Carolina, recently surpassed more than 1 million work hours without a lost-time injury, setting a new record among the organization&amp;#39;s seven worldwide manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Safety is the top priority at each of our facilities,&amp;quot; said David Cataldi, president of Janesville Acoustics. &amp;quot;While we have developed effective protocols and guidelines intended to minimize the risk of injury, our employees should be commended for their commitment to implementing them so effectively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines a lost-time injury as one that causes at least a single full-day work absence. The last time the Old Fort plant experienced such an event was more than two years ago. Plant manager Roy Heeralall attributes the record to a cultural emphasis on safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A key part of accomplishing this milestone is the &amp;#39;buddy system&amp;#39; that we utilize, which pairs seasoned employees with newer ones and requires these teams to continuously watch out for one another,&amp;quot; said Heeralall. &amp;quot;Our employees are excited about this accomplishment and have already set their sights on reaching 2 million hours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, Janesville Acoustics is a global producer of acoustical fiber insulation and molded fiber and die-cut products, with manufacturing plants and satellite offices in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Germany and Mexico. The Old Fort plant was established in 1988 and employs 220 people.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>7 Safety Tips to Reduce Mining Accidents</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/10/22/469debe6-cef3-40a8-97a5-b527c0ad561f_Picture2-forweb.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 196px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Working in mining is risky business. Earlier this year, a man was killed in an accident at a copper mine in Australia. Another accident at a coal mine in southwest China claimed 22 lives. In fact, China has some of the most dangerous mines in the world, and authorities have scrambled to try to enforce safety rules. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering a career in mining, it is crucial that you take the following safety measures to keep your time in the mines as trouble-free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Don&amp;#39;t Ignore the Danger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step toward keeping yourself safe is to be cognizant of the fact that working in mining is hazardous. Accept that the mining industry is inherently filled with danger and stay alert every moment on the job. Watch out for your colleagues as well and never let your guard down. Accidents with major impact can occur in a moment of carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Dangerous Tasks Require Planning and Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When planning tasks, don&amp;rsquo;t think only of completing them as efficiently as possible. Allot extra time and money for safety requirements. Never compromise the safety of your employees when trying to meet deadlines or to boost the quality of work. All risks should be assessed, including the possibility of accidents. Try to eliminate risks as much as possible. Where a risk still exists, provide your team with clear instructions and educate them on how to mitigate it. If necessary, deal with the danger should it arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Get Professional Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All team members should undergo regular safety training. This should not just apply to new team members. Even long-standing employees should be made to attend refresher courses. Safety training sessions that contain theory and practical components can be very helpful. Workers who take on strenuous roles may be sent for health and fitness checks to determine whether they are able to take on the physical demands of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Always Wear Safety Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a litany of safety equipment that mining workers use for their protection, from helmets to safety glasses and gloves. It is essential that all workers wear the necessary safety equipment at all times. There have been countless stories of workers being saved by helmets, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Supervise Your Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All team members should follow safety instructions with no exceptions. A supervisor must also be diligent about following up and enforcing the rules. Never allow more people to enter a site than are allowed. Supervisors also need to know the whereabouts of all team members throughout each shift. Likewise, all workers should be kept informed about what their fellow team members are doing throughout the day. Never allow any team members to breach the safety rules without a warning or, in the case of repeated disobedience, appropriate consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Document Your Safety Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When accidents happen, all team members should know exactly what to do. Safety procedures must be clearly defined. When documenting the safety procedures, describe the various incidents that might occur, what needs to be done and whom to contact. Safety procedures should be displayed prominently in locations that can be easily accessed by team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. Follow the Latest Safety Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensure all safety equipment is serviced regularly and satisfies all the latest safety standards. Never try to save on safety equipment. If an item no longer complies with the current safety standards, replace it, even if this means increasing expenses or delaying a project. Never allow staff to use outdated safety equipment, even for a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of safety-related incidents in the mining industry is high. Unfortunately, some of the tragedies that have occurred could have been prevented. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat the mistakes that have been made by others. While the risks can never be eliminated completely, following the above tips can help significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/XZbWgwQJyh8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Alabama Metal Manufacturer Cited for 23 Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Diversified Fabricating Inc. was recently cited by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 23 safety and health violations, including exposure to amputation and fall hazards, following an inspection at the company&amp;#39;s facility in Oneonta, Ala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the time of the inspection, workers were engaged in fabricating steel drums used in the lumber mill industry. Proposed penalties total $73,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This inspection identified numerous safety and health hazards, such as the accumulation of combustible materials throughout the facility, a lack of machine guarding, fall hazards and exposure to iron-oxide fumes, all of which put workers at risk of severe injury or death,&amp;quot; said Ramona Morris, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Birmingham area office. &amp;quot;These hazards should have been identified and corrected prior to any OSHA inspection, affording workers a safe and healthful working environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serious violations include exposing employees to iron-oxide fumes at levels higher than the permissible exposure limit, fire and explosion hazards from accumulated combustible material, and fall hazards from unprotected ladders and platforms. Additionally, the employer was cited for failing to develop procedures to protect workers from moving machine parts during servicing and maintenance, exposing workers to amputation and struck-by hazards by not properly guarding machinery, and allowing fuel and oxygen tanks to be improperly stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diversified Fabricating manufactures metal parts for the lumber mill industry and employs approximately 29 workers. The manufacturer has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Safe is Your Workplace?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/10/1/d5f32572-47f6-46ca-a682-ac94d38ae40c_safety-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 285px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;When deciding whether to accept a job, the usual considerations such as salary and location typically apply. However, few people think about workplace safety when deciding on an employer, but they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Workplace safety is actually one of the most important factors to consider, and if you work in an industry such as mining, construction, chemicals, pharmaceuticals or police work, you will want to ensure that your employer is being responsible about employee safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers have a responsibility to monitor your working conditions for safety hazards, and penalties may apply if the appropriate standards are not obeyed. While workplace safety requirements vary from country to country, there are basic rules and industry standards that should be followed in all situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;On-the-job safety is not something you can just take for granted,&amp;quot; said P. Grimshaw of &lt;a href="https://atkar.com.au/"&gt;Atkar&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;An employer has to be proactive in maintaining the highest standards of safety for everyone on the job site.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are 10 points to consider when evaluating whether your employer is committed to workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Are you informed about industry and duty risks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the minute you show up for the interview, your employer should make you aware of the potential risks of the job. Merely mentioning the risks in an off-hand manner is not enough. Your employer should explain in detail all the risks involved. If he or she tries to downplay or hide the risks, it might be time to look for a job elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Does your employer engage staff without a valid license?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Never work for an employer who is even thinking of hiring staff members without a valid license. Licenses exist not just to ensure the quality of employees&amp;#39; work but also to protect them and their colleagues from a safety point of view. Your employer should insist on hiring only individuals with the appropriate skills and certification levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Are employees allowed to perform new duties without prior training?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A responsible employer insists that all personnel are properly trained before being assigned new duties or responsibilities. Expecting employees to &amp;quot;figure things out&amp;quot; without proper training is unacceptable when safety risks are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Is a safety training calendar maintained?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A responsible employer thinks it&amp;#39;s important that employees are taught to identify hazards, manage risks and do the job safely. A safety training calendar should be adhered to and include modules such as induction training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Are safety policies implemented?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There should be formal documents at the workplace that clearly state what to do in case of emergencies. These documents must be kept up to date and be accessible to employees at all times. They should also be easy to understand and within easy reach during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Is high-quality safety gear provided?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do some market research on your own to determine if the safety gear provided by your employer is of high quality. If you find the safety gear used at your workplace to be lacking, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to speak up. It might just save someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. Are regular safety audits carried out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regular safety audits make certain that safety standards are upheld and that all safety measures and equipment are kept up to date. This goes a long way toward ensuring employee safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	8. Is &amp;quot;safety first&amp;quot; your company&amp;#39;s motto?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All safety regulations and standards should be taken with the utmost seriousness at all times. Safety should never be compromised, even if it means missing a deadline or increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	9. Does your employer lead by example?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Good leaders are never seen breaching the safety rules, and they don&amp;#39;t tolerate others doing so either. If your employer is not a role model, how can you trust him or her to keep your workplace safe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	10. Does your employer have a workers&amp;#39; compensation insurance policy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the event of a workplace accident, workers&amp;#39; compensation can help to ease the financial burden. Make sure your employer has an appropriate policy in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While your employer has a responsibility to keep you and your colleagues safe, you should take it upon yourself to understand the risks involved and speak up if you have any concerns. It is crucial to know how to avoid safety hazards, ensure equipment and tools are of the highest quality, and meet on-the-job safety standards at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/euhMnL_gC9k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Cummins Wins National Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The National Safety Council recently presented the 2014 Robert W. Campbell Award to Cummins Inc. Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, Cummins designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission solutions and electrical power generation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Campbell Award recognizes organizations that are committed to continuous improvement and have successfully integrated environmental, health and safety (EHS) management with business operations as a cornerstone of corporate excellence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Cummins is a true learning organization that continues to seek opportunities to strengthen its outstanding approach to safety, health and sustainability,&amp;quot; said Deborah A.P. Hersman, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. &amp;quot;Cummins is an example of a company far along on its journey to safety excellence but whose leaders still pursue improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Campbell Award nominees are evaluated on the organization&amp;#39;s EHS management system and its incorporation into business practices. According to the Campbell Award review committee, Cummins scored highly because its leaders have committed to safety through the company&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Live It, Lead It&amp;quot; program. Cummins actively engages its employees in meaningful, impactful projects in the places they live, and includes its supply chain and contractors as members of the Cummins family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our work in safety is about caring for our people who work every day to help our company succeed,&amp;quot; said Tom Linebarger, chairman and CEO of Cummins. &amp;quot;The Campbell Award is terrific recognition for the Cummins employees who have made tremendous progress in the area of safety at our company. However, we know that when it comes to safety, our work is never done. There is much more to do, and we will continue to be guided by our company&amp;#39;s mission to demand that everything we do leads to a cleaner, healthier and safer environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Founded in 1913 and chartered by Congress, the National Safety Council is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to save lives by preventing injuries and deaths at work, in homes and communities, and on the road through leadership, research, education and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Safway Plant Receives Zero Injury Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Safway Group recently received the National Maintenance Agreement Policy Committee&amp;#39;s (NMAPC) Bronze Star Zero Injury Safety Award (ZISA) after crew members at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in Wheatfield, Ind., completed more than 200,000 hours worked with zero recordable incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have worked really hard to instill a culture of safety on the job site,&amp;quot; said project foreman Larry Fugett. &amp;quot;Making sure the right safety leaders were in place was essential. The leadership team&amp;#39;s ability to be the front line of safety and to work closely with employees was paramount. Through our commitment to making safety personal for each crew member, we have fostered a strong sense of trust and camaraderie amongst employees. Every individual here takes safe work practices seriously and has adopted a zero-tolerance mentality. This award is a testament to our commitment to safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To receive the award, contractor&amp;#39;s projects must have zero incidents. Any projects performed in which days away, restricted or transferred (DART) cases, fatalities or any Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable has occurred are not eligible. Each ZISA applicant must also undergo an in-depth audit and vetting process where clients are contacted to verify that there are no recordable injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We believe that all workplace injuries are preventable,&amp;quot; says Steve Weron, Safway&amp;#39;s Midwest regional vice president. &amp;quot;Our employees are committed to a zero recordables philosophy in the workplace. We look forward to the challenge of working toward a Gold Star ZISA, which is only awarded to contractors with 1 million or more hours worked with zero recordables.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Texas Plastics Manufacturer Cited for 21 Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Plastic Systems LLC was recently cited by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 21 safety and health violations for failing to develop adequate lockout/tagout procedures to control the unexpected startup of the company&amp;#39;s plastic injection molding machines. Proposed penalties total $174,240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inspection was conducted in February 2014 after a safety referral was made during a health inspection initiated under the Combustible Dust National Emphasis Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Inspectors found workers at risk of potential injuries from preventable workplace hazards, including the unexpected startup of machinery during maintenance or servicing, the lack of machine guarding and electrical hazards,&amp;quot; said Joann Figueroa, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in El Paso, Texas. &amp;quot;OSHA&amp;#39;s standards must be followed to keep workers safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The six repeat violations, with a penalty of $112,860, were cited for failing to address specific lockout/tagout techniques for the servicing and maintenance of machinery and conduct annual inspections of these techniques and procedures. Plastic Systems failed to ensure workers had operable, portable fire extinguishers and were trained to use them. Improper maintenance resulted in electrical hazards, including conductors with damaged insulation. The company was cited previously in a 2011 inspection at the El Paso facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The remaining 15 violations, including 11 serious with a penalty of $61,380, were cited for failure to ensure workers knew the type and magnitude of energy that needed lockout control, provide machine guarding on injection molding machines, maintain electrical components and equipment in a manner that complies with safety requirements, properly record injuries and illnesses, adequately distribute portable fire extinguishers, and replace damaged circuit breaker boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plastic Systems, which employs about 80 workers at its El Paso location, designs and manufactures plastic molded products and assemblies. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s El Paso area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Greenwood Celebrates 3 Million Safe Hours at West Virginia Operations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/14/a1390734-7d4c-41c8-8b37-4d6f3d6651c0_Greenwood.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 207px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Maintenance, operations and construction solutions provider Greenwood Inc. recently celebrated 3 million safe hours at its West Virginia Operations (WVO) project based in South Charleston, W.Va. The safety milestone was reached after 12 years of continuous operations without a lost-time event while supporting clients in the chemical and petrochemical industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Greenwood president Brad Wood presented the operations team with a plaque commemorating the achievement and specifically cited Greenwood&amp;#39;s WVO safety manager, Tony Dean, and area project manager, Kenny Steen, for their leadership in setting the right course for site operations. Carhartt jackets were given to Greenwood employees as a gesture of appreciation for maintaining a safe work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;On the surface, safety can seem like a simple concept, but it has to be a priority every day,&amp;quot; Wood said. &amp;quot;We work very hard to train all employees at every level to perform safely and continuously maintain that kind of mindset. We are proud to achieve these performance results and appreciate the effort everyone puts forth to emphasize safety first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Greenwood provides integrated maintenance, construction and workforce solutions designed to extend the life of critical assets, influence operational efficiencies and deliver bottom-line improvements for plants and facilities throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states.

            <title>7 Safety Tips for Working in High Places</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/6/8ebf259a-a971-4f37-96ff-d41ff7a225c4_high-places.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 401px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In many industries, employees are required to deal with the many risks involved in working in high places. Most people automatically think of skyscraper building when considering dangerous occupations where work is done above ground level, but death or serious injury can occur much closer to the ground. If a simple fall is hard on the body, imagine the same fall from a distance of 8 to 10 feet. It&amp;#39;s exponentially harder on the body with every foot of height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Safety should be the No. 1 priority in any job, especially one in high places,&amp;quot; says John Chesterfield with &lt;a href="http://www.melwood.com.au/"&gt;Melwood&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help keep clear of the emergency room, implement and follow these safety tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Team Up and Trust Your Partner(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For obvious safety reasons, you should never do anything in high places without having help. If nothing else, have someone to steady the ladder, which is a must. But if something does happen to cause a fall, you need the other person to call for help. If possible, get to know the people you work with well enough to feel confident alongside them. Make sure each person on the job knows what his or her particular job is and whom to call for assistance if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Know the Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before starting any project, whether work-related or a home do-it-yourself job, if it requires working on a ladder, roof, platform or any height, know the plan. What exactly will you be doing up there? If you don&amp;#39;t have a plan for the task, make one. By drawing up and executing a plan for your task, you can minimize trips up and down, which will cut the risk of falling and making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Use Proper Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment you choose will vary depending on the job. You may need nothing more than a sturdy ladder, proper footwear and gloves to help with your grip as you go up and down. If you&amp;#39;re working on a steep gabled roof, a harness and safety line are in order. Barriers around the worksite are required for almost any job as well as hardhats, safety goggles, vests and a myriad of other items. While the list of safety equipment can be rather long, proper safety equipment is cheaper than a seriously injured employee or a lost life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Overcoming Anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s been proven that fear adds risk, especially in high places. Healthy fear is a good thing because it will remind you to be careful and put safety first. However, imagining the worst during a bout of height-related anxiety can become a self-fulfilling prophesy. Shore up your mental strength by imagining the best outcome for a job well done without a single slip. If you have trouble with serious anxiety while working in high places, there are mental exercises a professional counselor can guide you through. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to seek help if it&amp;#39;s needed. Your safety, and that of others, may depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Be in Good Shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working in high places not only requires good mental health but also involves physical strength. Beyond just the ability to climb a ladder or scaffolding, it&amp;#39;s about the sleep you got the night before and the food you eat. Your ability to focus depends on good life choices from proper sleep to the foods consumed. Without a good night&amp;#39;s sleep, you&amp;#39;re going to be tired, which makes you inattentive and prone to mistakes. The same thing happens if you have a belly full of greasy chips instead of healthy energy-providing food. Proper hydration is also important for physical endurance. Few things will cause someone to become weak and dizzy faster than being dehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Illegal Mind-Altering Drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There should be a zero-tolerance policy regarding mind-altering and illegal drugs for any employee working in high places and/or operating machinery or vehicles. Periodic on-the-spot drug tests will catch problem employees, and immediate removal from the job is best for all concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers should ensure all employees undergo regular safety training sessions and classes on handling emergency situations. New employees should be assigned mentors, with more experienced workers showing new hires the ropes. Regular safety inspections of equipment are helpful as well. Safety can only be as good as the equipment used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, be careful up there. Never underestimate the risk, even if it seems routine. In the long run, taking a little extra time for solid safety protocols will save money and possibly a life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/JUlH00hrMro" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Louisiana Food-Processing Plant Cited for 16 Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently cited Acadian Fine Foods LLC for 16 safety and health violations, including 14 serious, one willful and one repeat violation, following a referral inspection that began in December 2013 at the Church Point processing plant. The food processor faces $121,660 in proposed fines for failing to protect workers from overexposure to carbon dioxide, dangerous machines and other safety hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Acadian Fine Foods exposed employees to levels of carbon dioxide that were at least four times above the permissible exposure limit,&amp;quot; said Dorinda Folse, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director. &amp;quot;This glaring neglect of worker health and safety will not be tolerated. OSHA&amp;#39;s safety and health standards must be followed to prevent worker injuries and fatalities. It is the employer&amp;#39;s responsibility to find and fix these hazards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Originally, OSHA&amp;#39;s Baton Rouge Area Office conducted a complaint inspection in November 2013, which resulted in Acadian being cited with four serious violations for electrical hazards and unsafe forklift operation. That penalty, which the employer settled in May, was $15,400. However, a health referral was made based on employees being exposed to unsafe levels of carbon dioxide, which resulted in the December 2013 inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 14 serious violations, with a fine of $72,380, involved failing to guard moving machine parts; conduct annual inspections of lockout/tagout procedures; properly identify respiratory hazards at the plant; include safety data sheets for carbon dioxide, sanitizer and boiler water treatment; and provide personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a penalty of $38,500, one willful citation was issued for exposing workers to carbon dioxide levels deemed life threatening. The employer failed to implement proper controls to reduce the carbon dioxide levels in the plant and provide workers with adequate respiratory protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One repeat violation, with a penalty of $10,780, was cited for failing to ensure an electrical panel box was enclosed to eliminate worker exposure to live electrical wires. A similar violation was cited in the April 2012 inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Acadian Fine Foods&amp;#39; Church Point food-processing plant, which employs approximately 29 workers, has 15 working days from receipt of its citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Tips for Preventing Forklift Accidents</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/23/9aadbc51-3537-4604-b588-1ba3076cd015_forklift.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 201px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Forklifts are among the most frequently used pieces of equipment in the workplace, with more than 856,000 in operation throughout the United States. Unfortunately, accidents involving forklifts are also quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), forklift accidents are responsible for approximately 100 deaths, 34,900 serious injuries and 61,800 minor injuries each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a variety of things that can cause forklift accidents, including a lack of training or inadequate training, carelessness by drivers, improper tools and attachments, and failure to maintain the forklift. Typical accidents involve vehicle tip-overs, which can lead to operator fatalities, and forklifts pinning and crushing individuals against another surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having appropriate safety measures in place is critical to prevent these injuries and reduce the risk of fatalities. Below are a few ways you can avoid serious injuries and hazards when working with forklifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Be Aware of Carbon Monoxide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forklifts emit carbon monoxide and must be correctly ventilated. If you drive a forklift in an enclosed area, you should be aware of the increased risk of carbon-monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Proper Parking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Allow yourself plenty of time to park and secure a forklift at the end of the day. This will prevent others from accidently walking into it. Ensure the forklift is safely parked, and the key is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Correct Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA requires all operators to follow proper training procedures and to maintain their machinery. Forklift inspections are essential to determine if a machine needs servicing, which can help to prevent accidents and injuries. OSHA collects more than $2 million each year from citations issued to organizations that fail to maintain their forklifts or provide adequate training to their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Loading Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forklifts can tip over easily if they are improperly loaded. In fact, 14 percent of all forklift accidents occur in this manner. Another dangerous loading hazard to avoid is using a forklift to elevate an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Driving Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accidents as the result of driving issues and operating the equipment are perhaps the most common. Driving off a loading dock leads to 7 percent of all forklift accidents. Other forklift accidents are due to vision problems and operator error/control issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, forklift accidents can happen at any time. By implementing appropriate training and safety measures, you can reduce the risks of forklift accidents and workplace injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/NOPIAU3e72k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Safway Earns Safety Excellence Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Safway Group recently received two Contractor Safety Excellence Awards for injury-free performance in 2013 at two refinery jobsites. Crew members at the Valero St. Charles refinery in Norco, La., worked a combined 261,677 hours without a recordable incident. Another crew working at the Phillips 66 Belle Chase site in Belle Chase, La., worked onsite for a total of 158,899 hours injury-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Contractor Safety Excellence Awards program was designed by the Gulf Coast Safety Council (GCSC) to recognize the safety successes of crew members. A non-profit corporation, GCSC provides state-of-the-art training and support processes in industrial education for plant personnel and contract workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To qualify as a recipient of the Contractor Safety Excellence Award, nominated crews had to achieve zero fatalities, lost workday cases, total recordable cases and OSHA citations in both their respective company class and hours-worked category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When you are nominated for safety awards by multiple customers, you know that you are doing something right,&amp;quot; said Safway New Orleans Branch Manager Sam Pruet. &amp;quot;Safety is our No. 1 priority. These awards exemplify our dedication to continuously improve safe work practices. We are proud of our employees who have demonstrated their commitment to safe work practices, which has rightfully earned them these awards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the Valero St. Charles refinery, Safway has performed both lump-sum and time-and-material work for major capital projects, construction, and turnarounds for several years. With up to 85 onsite employees, Safway Group is providing insulation, scaffold components and coating services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safway has also been a strong presence at the Bell Chase jobsite since 2009. With its Systems Scaffold, crew members have performed numerous maintenance, capitol and turnaround projects totaling more than 1 million man-hours with zero recordable incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Role of Leadership in Promoting a Safety Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/6/17/5f66f87c-786c-48b3-b370-15dcfcd9df36_dupont-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;With many companies today struggling to adjust to new business pressures arising from the current economic environment, the necessity to &amp;quot;do more with less&amp;quot; has become increasingly commonplace. While this can present significant challenges to a business&amp;#39;s prospects for growth and profitability, there is one effort that companies can pursue to help them thrive in the midst of today&amp;#39;s increasingly complex business realities. Companies that endeavor to integrate environmental, health and safety management (EHS) into their operations are not simply rewarded with lower incidence and injury rates among employees, but they also can realize increased financial and social rewards as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont is an excellent case study in how EHS management can translate to a stronger bottom line. With a total recordable injury rate that improved 13 percent compared to the previous year, 2012 was DuPont&amp;#39;s best year ever. At the same time, DuPont saw 3 percent revenue growth in 2012, exceeded its target for fixed cost productivity, and many of its businesses delivered strong sales growth, earnings growth or margin expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While there are many factors that contribute to effective EHS management within a company, the most critical is strong, committed and engaged leadership within an organization. At DuPont, strong leadership from the C-Suite to middle-management has been the most important component of a successful management system that integrates EHS in every corner of the company. In fact, in the early 1990s, former DuPont CEO Ed Woolard chartered a discovery team to define a path to achieve sustainable improvement in safety while building business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the major outcomes of this effort was development of the Bradley curve, which enables an organization to understand where it is currently situated along the journey toward attaining a culture that effectively implements EHS processes, and what needs to be done to achieve improvement. The Bradley curve has become a leading quantitative indicator used extensively both inside and outside of DuPont to measure and rank an organization&amp;#39;s maturity or relative culture strength (RCS). While it is based on three major domains &amp;ndash; leadership, structure, and processes and actions, &amp;ndash; the journey begins with and sustains itself primarily through leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in today&amp;#39;s business environment, the more formal definition of leadership and how it is applied within an organization is evolving. Organizations are now facing new realities and business trends in which a smaller, more global workforce must assume greater responsibilities and transfer knowledge among one another more often. Workers now must be brought onboard and trained quickly to handle multiple tasks, and that is happening more frequently as employers navigate a changing workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The emerging trend of distributed teams of employees working with colleagues across practice areas or groups, and not exclusively with a consistent set of co-workers on a single project or task, is becoming the norm. There is reason to believe that organizations that gain and maintain high levels of relative culture strength are better prepared to adapt and thrive in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result, different leadership is required today to effectively move an organization along the Bradley curve to achieve interdependence and to successfully integrate EHS processes. This leadership requires less over-the-shoulder management of employees and more freedom for smaller groups of individuals to work independently on tasks. Employees then increasingly assume a mindset and behavior of &amp;quot;being a leader&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;needing a leader.&amp;quot; High levels of organizational success come from such a combination of formal and shared leadership. In fact, shared leadership enables organizations to progress along the Bradley curve more rapidly. The more leadership-ability workers assume and demonstrate across various teams within the organization, the more interdependency is achieved to enhance EHS as well as other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations to capitalize on this trend, managers must first recognize the need to change their own approaches toward leadership. Hierarchical mindsets toward leadership are still deeply ingrained in today&amp;#39;s business culture. Successful managers will recognize that their traditional roles are evolving and begin to encourage shared leadership within their organization, in effect becoming change agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By understanding they no longer have all the answers and by seeking input from workers they supervise, managers will show they value collaboration and, in the process, empower workers to find solutions and assume leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent sampling of 445 members from 62 teams in 31 stores of a national home-improvement company showed managers could effectively empower team leadership if they &amp;quot;delegate enough autonomy and responsibility to all members of their team, involve the team in decision-making, and encourage the team to self-manage its performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, implementing shared leadership is not without its challenges. For example, consensus and decision-making can be difficult to achieve. It probably comes as little surprise that team attitudes, turf battles and individual career goals can be impediments to decision-making. This points to the benefit of organizations striking the correct balance between formal and shared leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also critical to successfully implementing EHS is the quality of leading by example. A leadership structure that demonstrates a commitment to EHS and conveys its importance through actions is essential to gaining acceptance and implementation of processes by employees. At DuPont, this is achieved through a concept called Visible Felt Leadership, in which leaders emphasize a demanding, uncompromising and ever-improving safety culture, and establish expectations that are clearly and universally understood, accepted and practiced. Furthermore, leaders ensure these expectations are promoted by every manager in the organization. There is direct engagement by leadership with employees in all aspects of driving EHS as core values within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This engagement is an essential component. It does more than convey leadership&amp;#39;s passion and commitment to EHS throughout an organization. It also reinforces leadership&amp;#39;s commitment to empowering workers rather than simply directing them, a necessary change to traditional management practices. Empowering and engaging employees helps increase EHS performance in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new realities of today&amp;#39;s business environment present a challenge for organizations seeking to effectively integrate EHS across their operations. Overcoming this challenge requires adapting long-held approaches toward leadership from that of a top-down structure toward that of a shared leadership approach that empowers and engages employees to take accountability for themselves and their teams to make sound decisions and achieve results. The good news is this new leadership approach can accelerate an organization&amp;#39;s journey toward interdependence which, in turn, can deliver higher levels of EHS integration, increased financial returns and improved social rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/4vWNX8P_WIQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Rhode Island Plant Cited After Fire, Explosion </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently cited Inferno Wood Pellet Inc. after a combustible wood dust explosion and fire occurred at the company&amp;#39;s plant in East Providence, R.I., injuring a worker and partially demolishing the building. The ignition of wood dust in the plant&amp;#39;s production room migrated to a retention bin, resulting in an explosion that spread through the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While no one was killed, the potential for death and serious injury was real, present and preventable,&amp;quot; said Patrick Griffin, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director for Rhode Island. &amp;quot;The lack of safeguards allowed the initial fire and explosion to occur and spread in a chain reaction to other equipment and through the plant. If this employer had adhered to applicable OSHA and National Fire Protection Association standards, that would have helped prevent the fire and explosion from occurring and spreading.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An OSHA investigation found that employees at the plant were exposed to wood dust explosions, deflagrations or rapid combustion and other fire hazards due to inadequate or absent preventive and protective measures in the wood pellet processing system and its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, OSHA found that the retention bin lacked spark detection, explosion suppression, fire/explosion isolation and explosion venting devices. In addition, the plant&amp;#39;s conveyor systems carrying combustible wood products lacked spark detection, fire suppression and/or fire isolation devices. Dust collection systems and dust segregation barriers were also not maintained to minimize fire sources, and an opening in the firewall between the plant&amp;#39;s production room and chip room allowed a fireball to enter the chip room and spread the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other fire hazards identified by OSHA included the accumulation of combustible wood dust on various locations and surfaces within the plant, an incomplete and inadequate fire prevention plan, and lack of dust-tight electrical equipment where combustible wood dust accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional hazards involved an incomplete respiratory protection program, lack of noise monitoring, inadequate chemical hazard communication and training, excess amounts of liquefied petroleum gas stored in the building, an untrained forklift operator, and lack of procedures and training to ensure that all equipment was properly de-energized to prevent unintended activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of these and other hazards, OSHA has cited Inferno for 11 serious violations of workplace safety standards and has proposed $43,400 in fines. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Combustible wood dust is a byproduct of the manufacturing process, and it is the employer&amp;#39;s responsibility to ensure that proper and effective safeguards are in place and in use at all times so that incidents like this fire and explosion do not occur,&amp;quot; said Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inferno has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet informally with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Lift Trucks Ranked Safest in Material Handling Study</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to a recent study on lift-truck safety conducted by the Peerless Research Group, Toyota Material Handling U.S.A. (TMHU) ranked No. 1 in safety with the fewest safety-related incidents and the most affordable lift trucks to maintain in terms of safety for the fourth consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toyota is committed to the issue of safety,&amp;quot; said Jeff Rufener, president of TMHU. &amp;quot;Toyota&amp;#39;s forklifts offer a number of ergonomic, productivity and durability features, and most importantly, the industry&amp;#39;s leading safety technology, Toyota&amp;#39;s system of active stability. We are proud our forklifts consistently rank highest in safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study was conducted with qualified readers of &lt;em&gt;Modern Materials Handling&lt;/em&gt; magazine to better understand and track which lift-truck safety factors are most important and which companies are regarded as manufacturers of the safest lift trucks. Those surveyed were selected from subscribers who are involved in the use, evaluation and purchase of lift trucks and lift-truck accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a division of Peerless Media, Peerless Research Group specializes in marketing and media research solutions for material handling, logistics and supply chain marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>AK Tube Plant Earns Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The AK Tube plant in Walbridge, Ohio, was recently recognized for outstanding safety performance by the Ohio Bureau of Workers&amp;#39; Compensation Division of Safety and Hygiene. The recognition is part of a collaborative safety awareness program established by the Northwest Ohio Safety Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Walbridge plant received the &amp;quot;Special Award for Safety&amp;quot; for operating for more than 1.2 million man-hours without a lost-time injury between March 17, 2009, and June 13, 2013. This is the fifth time the plant has received the award.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Con-way Receives Plant Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Con-way Manufacturing recently announced that it has been honored with the 2013 Plant Safety Award from the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA). This marks the fourth straight year and fifth time that Con-way Manufacturing has received this honor from TTMA; the company was also an award recipient in 2004, 2010, 2011 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the TTMA Plant Safety program, award winners are selected based on an evaluation and ranking from injury data recorded with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Con-way Manufacturing won in the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; category, which includes manufacturing plants that annually log 300,000 man-hours or less in operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The evaluation considered numerical data in seven areas: fatalities, total lost workday cases, total cases with job transfer or restriction, days away from work, days of job transfer or job restriction, total number of other recordable cases and total cases (of injuries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This award represents Con-way Manufacturing&amp;#39;s belief that safety is everybody&amp;#39;s responsibility and succeeds only with the support of every employee,&amp;quot; said Lynn Reinbolt, president of Con-way Manufacturing. &amp;quot;Involving employees with a team approach to monitoring safety performance has a much more effective result compared to supervisor-directed mandates. I am proud of our whole team in setting this precedent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year marks the 43rd presentation of the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards. TTMA is a member-based organization established to build confidence between manufacturers of truck trailers, cargo tanks, intermodal containers and their suppliers to bring about a mutual understanding of the problems confronting all manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Con-way Manufacturing consistently sets the standards for others in the industry to replicate when it comes to plant safety,&amp;quot; said Jeff Sims, president of TTMA. &amp;quot;Their innovative safety practices are unprecedented, which is why they consistently come out on top in their category for this award.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since receiving its first Plant Safety Award in 2004, Con-way Manufacturing has not only decreased its incident frequency rate by more than 800 percent but also grown by 120 employees during that time. One of Con-way Manufacturing&amp;#39;s secrets to success is its behavior-based strategy, which produces results that improve every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, outfitted with bright orange shirts to signify the need for additional attention, new employees are placed on a six-month probationary period during which all plant personnel are responsible for monitoring their safety.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bluestar Silicones Achieves Responsible Care Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Bluestar Silicones recently achieved certification under the Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) at its U.S. manufacturing facility in York, S.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility, which opened in 2012, underwent three independent audits as part of a year-long program to align with the environmental, health and safety standards under the American Chemistry Council&amp;#39;s (ACC) Responsible Care program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2012, Bluestar Silicones relocated its manufacturing facilities in Ventura, Calif., and Rock Hill, S.C., to the 226,000-square-foot facility in York as part of its global growth strategy. The investment included state-of-the-art clean rooms and enhanced systems to ensure the highest level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;During the relocation and integration of two locations into one new site, safety was our top priority,&amp;quot; said Dave Beaty, director of strategic development and compliance. &amp;quot;Safety of our employees, our contractors, our neighbors and the environment was key to our success, all while maintaining continuous supply for our customers throughout the transition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RCMS offers an integrated, structured approach to improve company performance in the following key areas: community awareness and emergency response, security, distribution, employee health and safety, pollution prevention, and process and product safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Shortly after the startup of the York facility, we launched into the RCMS certification process to help build the foundation of a new site culture,&amp;quot; Beaty added. &amp;quot;We are pleased with the best practices that were identified in the audit and the positive comments of auditors that reflect the quality culture we have established here in York. RCMS is truly a team system here in York.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the audit results, all employees interviewed understood what Responsible Care is and effectively articulated how the Responsible Care principles applied to their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our new plant serves as the cornerstone for our success here in North America and ultimately our customers&amp;#39; success,&amp;quot; said J. Christopher York, president of Bluestar Silicones in North America. &amp;quot;RCMS is a key component of the culture of our new site, and I am incredibly proud of the team for accomplishing this rigorous certification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company produces an extensive range of silicone technologies at the York facility, including liquid silicone rubber, high consistency rubber, room-temperature vulcanized silicones, gels, greases and compounds, emulsions, thermal cure release coatings, foam control additives, and functionalized fluids and resins marketed under its Bluesil, Silbione, Silcolease, Silcolapse and Lyndcoat trade names.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Owens Corning Awarded Green Cross for Safety Medal</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/15/0b3f698c-63fe-48ff-830e-356f1245c21c_owens-corning-2.jpeg" style="width: 220px; height: 176px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The National Safety Council recently presented Owens Corning with the Green Cross for Safety medal at its 15th annual fundraising dinner in Atlanta. The dinner honored Owens Corning for its steadfast commitment to improving safety and health in the workplace and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Receiving the Green Cross for Safety medal honors the dedication of all of our employees,&amp;quot; said Michael H. Thaman, Owens Corning chairman and CEO. &amp;quot;We lead from safety, which means our ability to execute on safety is a primary indicator of how we perform as a company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Owens Corning is currently on a journey to zero injuries, which has resulted in 95 percent of its injuries being eliminated over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is an honor for the Council to recognize Owens Corning with the Green Cross for Safety medal,&amp;quot; said Jeff Woodbury, National Safety Council board chairman. &amp;quot;Owens Corning exhibits safety leadership at all levels of the organization and demonstrates its commitment to safety by building successful partnerships to save lives and prevent injuries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Good Project Management Contributes to Workplace Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/19/b943666b-b892-4819-907f-fef5da28657e_workplace-safety.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Every workplace owes its employees a duty to ensure their safety at work. When a workplace is a high-risk one, such as a construction site or a plant, it is particularly important to be meticulous about safety given the potential for the occurrence of disastrous accidents. When an environment is inherently risky and may give rise to dangerous situations, careful project management is necessary in order to ensure employees&amp;rsquo; safety. While safety measures can certainly help to reduce the risk of workplace injuries, without sound project management such measures may be rendered ineffective. Following are a few reasons project management is a key ingredient in ensuring workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Centralized Point of Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many serious accidents don&amp;rsquo;t just happen out of the blue. Instead, they are often preceded by seemingly benign situations that nonetheless reveal potential dangers. For example, employees neglecting to wear proper safety equipment can usually be identified as a risk even before an accident occurs. Many dangerous situations also develop over long periods of time and can be spotted before an accident occurs. For instance, any wear and tear or damage to equipment or scaffolding is usually noticed before it leads to accidents. Good project management will provide anyone who notices potentially dangerous situations with a centralized point of contact to report such dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Central Point for Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As employee numbers increase, it becomes difficult to be apprised of what each individual team is doing, and this may cause overlaps in tasks that can prove dangerous. Sound project management is needed for effective scheduling, which can ensure, for instance, that the maximum number of people who can be accommodated safely in a particular area is never exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Keeps Employees Informed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not enough for management to know who is doing what and where. All employees need to be similarly apprised of what is going on so they do not make mistakes that might give rise to dangerous situations. This is best done with a daily morning briefing that will keep all employees up to date before they begin work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	First Point of Contact for Outsiders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many dangerous situations arise because an outsider, such as a worker from another company or a deliveryman, enters the premises without being aware of safety rules and danger zones. Good project management provides all outsiders with a first point of contact to ensure they do not end up wandering around the premises unaccompanied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By offering centralized organization, project management contributes invaluably to workplace safety. This is especially crucial when there are large numbers of employees or teams performing different tasks. When employees and teams are not aware of what others are doing, they unwittingly cause dangerous situations to arise. With clear and concise scheduling and employees who have a keen awareness of what is going on at the premises, risks at the workplace can be reduced considerably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/yBf1AzShUMg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Risks of Workplace Confined Spaces </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/5/60e12b84-905e-46f6-8b37-4ba5cfdea479_confined-space.jpeg" style="width: 294px; height: 283px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A cement plant worker in Ohio died after being trapped in a silo full of fly ash. A 42-year-old worker in Monroe, Wash., who had climbed into a grain storage bin in an effort to open a stuck chute at the bottom, died when he fell to the bottom. Deadly methane gas from a manure pit killed five in Virginia. Three oil field workers were overcome and killed by poisonous gases in an oil well in Kansas, the second two men while trying to rescue the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these sad workplace accidents were quite possibly preventable, making them even more tragic. Unfortunately, they are not isolated tragedies but have been repeated in many workplaces with confined spaces. Deaths in confined spaces are considered a recurring occupational tragedy, with 60 percent of these fatalities involving would-be rescuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Almost any workplace can have confined spaces. Examples include septic tanks, silos, reaction vessels, sewage digesters, vats, boilers, pumping and lift stations, ducts of all sorts, pipelines, sewage distribution systems, manholes, utility vaults, pits and holding tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines a confined space as one that is: large enough for a worker to enter completely and perform assigned tasks; not designed for continuous occupancy by workers (or anyone else); and has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What makes confined spaces particularly dangerous is that the risk of exposure to atmospheric toxins or other hazards is compounded because of the very element of confinement, the limited access to the space and the restricted air flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asphyxiation is the leading cause of death in confined spaces. Asphyxiation occurs in spaces as a result of oxygen deficiency, exposure to toxic atmospheres or employees falling into narrow discharge pipes and dying from compression of the torso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After years of research on fatalities and testimonies about the hazards of working in confined spaces, OSHA put into place a standard for permit-required confined spaces (29 CFR 1910.146). It applies to all of general industry and is considered a &amp;ldquo;performance-oriented&amp;rdquo; standard, which gives employers leeway to protect their employees in the most efficient way possible from the specific hazards of the confined spaces in their workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The confined-space standard differs from many other OSHA standards in that it is not a &amp;quot;prescriptive standard,&amp;quot; which details what materials, designs and construction methods are allowed to be used, often without ever stating the actual goals and objectives of the given standard. The standard specifically addresses permit-required confined spaces, which are characterized as having:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A hazardous atmosphere (or the potential for a hazardous atmosphere),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A material that has the potential to engulf someone who enters the space,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An internal configuration that could cause a worker to be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor that slopes downward, tapering to a smaller area, and/or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any other recognized serious safety or health hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sadly, even though the OSHA standard has been in place for 20 years, these tragedies are still occurring today. The first three scenarios listed above have each happened within the last 10 years. The tragedy at the cement plant in Ohio occurred in just the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Workers are still dying in workplace confined spaces for a variety of reasons. Some employers have not taken into consideration that confined-space tragedies typically don&amp;#39;t stop at mere injuries but usually result in almost immediate danger to both life and health. As a result, the employers in these tragedies have attempted to improvise a solution that doesn&amp;#39;t result in safe confined-space practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the same reason, employers ignore safe industry practices, do not address existing or possible confined-space hazards in their workplace, and do not train their employees on safe work practices in those confined spaces. Employees also get too comfortable with the hazards presented and ignore safety regulations, or get in a hurry and don&amp;#39;t use common sense or required safe work practices in the confined space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of the reason, the results are tragic. Lives are lost, families are forever altered, work is slowed or stopped altogether, and the employers find themselves facing great expenses and financial loss. Therefore, both employers and employees must be frequently reminded of the dangers presented by confined spaces and consider how their own families will be affected by the loss of a loved one to a confined space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/S5rdJvN09hA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Automotive Manufacturer Fined $207,100 for Safety Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited HP Pelzer Automotive Systems Inc. of Thomson, Ga., and staffing agency Sizemore Inc. for 22 safety and health violations. OSHA initiated its inspection in July 2013 in response to a complaint alleging hazards at the automotive manufacturing facility. Proposed penalties total $207,100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;HP Pelzer continues to put workers at risk of serious injury or death by failing to correct unguarded equipment and other serious hazards,&amp;quot; said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Atlanta-East Area Office. &amp;quot;Additionally, Sizemore must work proactively with its client to ensure temporary workers receive appropriate safety and health training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HP Pelzer, a supplier of automotive parts for major car manufacturers, employs approximately 10,000 workers across nine facilities in the United States and Mexico. The Thomson facility, which produces parts such as outer dashes and hood liners, employs 256 workers, including 176 temporary employees. Sizemore is the temporary staffing agency under contract with HP Pelzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA cited HP Pelzer for 11 serious safety and health violations, carrying $80,100 in penalties. The inspection found that the employer failed to prevent compressed air from being used for cleaning without a means to regulate the pressure. Additionally, workers were exposed to potential thermal skin burns from unprotected hot pipes and fittings. Other violations include failing to develop and implement written lockout/tagout procedures for machinery repair, not ensuring unblocked exit routes and not developing or implementing a hazard communication program for those exposed to formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA cited HP Pelzer for three repeat violations, carrying penalties of $121,000, which were associated with previous inspections in 2008 and 2009. Multiple citations for similar hazards were previously issued at other HP Pelzer facilities. Workers were again exposed to amputation and laceration hazards stemming from a lack of guarding on machine parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The contract with Sizemore, which maintains an administrative office at the facility, specifies that the staffing agency will provide workers with some of the training before their assignment. As a result, the staffing agency was issued one serious health citation, with $6,000 in penalties, for not providing temporary workers with training regarding formaldehyde and its hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AK Steel Coke Plant Earns Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel recently announced that its coke plant in Middletown, Ohio, has received the Max Eward Safety Award from the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute (ACCCI), a leading industry trade organization. The award recognizes the company for operating one of the safest coke-making facilities in America during 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel&amp;#39;s Middletown Works coke plant, along with two other ACCCI member coke facilities, operated the entire year of 2013 without any recordable injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;AK Steel is honored to be recognized by the ACCCI &amp;ndash; an achievement that reflects the company&amp;#39;s commitment to safety at all of our manufacturing operations,&amp;quot; said James L. Wainscott, AK Steel chairman, president and CEO. &amp;quot;We congratulate everyone at our Middletown Works coke plant, as well as all those affiliated with our fellow Max Eward award winners, for their outstanding safety performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ACCCI recognition marks the 14th time in the past 17 years that an AK Steel coke plant has received the Max Eward Safety Award. The company&amp;#39;s Middletown Works coke plant is now a 10-time recipient of the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The employees at AK Steel&amp;#39;s Middletown Works coke plant continue to be role models for safety in the workplace,&amp;quot; said Bruce Steiner, president of the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute. &amp;quot;We congratulate them and the company for promoting a culture of safety that continues to produce exceptional results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to AK Steel&amp;#39;s Middletown Works coke plant, the company&amp;#39;s plants in Rockport, Ind., and Zanesville, Ohio, operated the entire year of 2013 without any recordable injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Minerals Plant Cited for Repeat Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Minerals LLC was recently cited for six safety violations by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for failing to provide fall protection, personal protective equipment and to implement procedures to control hazardous energy. The company faces $195,470 in penalties after an inspection found repeat violations at its facility in Baldwin, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;U.S. Minerals continues to expose workers to hazards associated with energy-control procedures, including willfully violating lockout and tagout procedures and exposing workers to amputation hazards,&amp;quot; said Thomas Bielema, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Peoria, Ill. &amp;quot;U.S. Minerals repeatedly has been cited at this facility and others for failing to protect workers from these hazards. OSHA is committed to ensuring employers abide by the law, which requires common-sense safety practices that U.S. Minerals must follow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two willful violations were cited during the most recent inspection. One was for failing to have guards on standard railings, which exposed workers to fall hazards of up to 40 feet. The second was for the company&amp;#39;s failure to ensure that lockout/tagout procedures were applied to prevent the unexpected start-up of equipment while employees performed service and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three repeat violations were cited for not conducting an annual inspection of energy-control procedures; not ensuring that each authorized employee affixed a lockout device to energy-isolating devices prior to performing service and maintenance; and for failing to develop, document and utilize procedures for servicing equipment where more than one employee was performing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, one serious violation was issued for failing to provide personal protective equipment that would prevent falls by employees working on top of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following an inspection in June 2010, OSHA issued a $466,400 penalty to the company&amp;#39;s Baldwin facility in September of that year, citing 35 health and safety violations for willfully exposing workers to dangerously high levels of hazardous dust and failing to provide adequate breathing protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of the conditions found at the Baldwin plant, OSHA initiated inspections of the company&amp;#39;s three other facilities. At the company&amp;#39;s location in Coffeen, Ill., OSHA issued 28 health and safety citations in December 2010. In November 2010, the company&amp;#39;s operation in Harvey, La., was cited for 30 violations, while its facility in Galveston, Texas, was cited for 38 violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Minerals was placed in OSHA&amp;#39;s Severe Violator Enforcement Program in December 2010. The program focuses on employers with a history of safety violations that endanger workers by demonstrating indifference to their responsibilities under the law. This enforcement tool includes mandatory OSHA follow-up inspections and inspections of other work sites of the same employer where similar hazards and deficiencies may be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With headquarters in Dyer, Ind., U.S. Minerals manufactures abrasive blasting and roofing materials from slag produced at coal-fired power plants. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Connecticut Metal-finishing Plant Fined for Serious Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Har-Conn Chrome Co. Inc. for 15 violations of workplace health and safety standards at the company&amp;#39;s plant in West Hartford, Conn. The metal finisher faces $66,220 in fines following a complaint that prompted an investigation by OSHA&amp;#39;s Hartford area office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We found employees exposed to various chemical and mechanical hazards, including similar hazards cited during a 2010 inspection of the plant,&amp;quot; said Warren Simpson, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Hartford. &amp;quot;Left uncorrected, employees are exposed to fire, chemical burns, eye injuries, lacerations and other substances. For the health and well-being of its workers, the employer must take effective action to address and prevent these conditions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, the employer failed to provide emergency eye and face protection for workers around caustic liquids, install adequate guarding on grinders and shafting, and label containers of hazardous chemicals. OSHA cited the plant for similar hazards in May 2010. For these recurring hazards, OSHA has issued Har-Conn six repeat citations with $36,960 in fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nine serious citations, with $29,260 in fines, were issued for failing to monitor workers&amp;#39; exposure levels to formaldehyde, conduct an asbestos survey, provide hand protection, train workers on using fire extinguishers, furnish first-aid supplies, ensure an adequate workspace around spray booths and properly dispose of combustible waste materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet informally with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>4 Ways to Improve Workplace Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/12/27/ee363987-9115-48ce-bd27-3e6665acfba9_workplace safety.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Most successful organizations know to do certain things to ensure an engaged and productive workforce, but many are inconsistent and are not purposeful in their efforts to create this type of atmosphere. The following four methods can help you achieve improved workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Effective safety programs will not occur in an atmosphere where employees do not feel as if they have a role in the organization&amp;rsquo;s success. We focus so much on self-actualization and meeting an employee&amp;rsquo;s individual needs, but common sense and various studies show that employees&amp;rsquo; greatest work need (after basic needs are satisfied) is to have a sense that they contribute to the organization&amp;rsquo;s success. I am convinced that sense of one&amp;rsquo;s role is one of several reasons that the 9,000-employee Children&amp;rsquo;s Healthcare of Atlanta is on the best places to work list every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Neglecting safety is a clear message that you don&amp;rsquo;t care about employees, so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if the employees, in turn, do not care about their work and your customers. Honestly, how many bosses walk right by their employees and are more difficult to talk with than your physician? You must have boundaries in order to get anything done, but that efficiency is no excuse for isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Don&amp;#39;t wait to address problems. Praise successes. Have a &amp;quot;morning huddle&amp;quot; to celebrate recent accomplishments. We may talk a good game, but most of our safety efforts focus on punishing errors and tracking lagging indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Involving employees in safety is an effective way to focus employees on their role in the overall organization&amp;rsquo;s success. Give employees latitude in how to accomplish their jobs. Let them solve problems or come up with improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of you may already be familiar with these suggestions, but are you purposefully encouraging the atmosphere that keeps your star employees coming to work and impressing customers? Do your actions substantiate your statements that you are pro-employee and that safety is No. 1?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/5Ytqkk6qZXU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>40 Things You Can Learn from America's Safest Companies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The following workplace safety ideas have been employed by award-winning companies and may work for your organization, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Project manager and superintendent bonuses depend on safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Company and subcontractor incidents are investigated, and then the project team makes a presentation of the findings to management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All field management personnel must have received Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training within the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The CEO leads weekly company-wide safety conference calls for all project management personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Everyone, from the foremen to the owner of the company, receives OSHA training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The superintendent presents the site-specific orientation for new hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A safety committee with a 4-to-1 ratio of field employees to management visits at least once per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A subcontractor safety summit is conducted by company presidents and operations managers to demonstrate that safety standards come from the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The foreman and superintendent are certified as &amp;quot;competent persons&amp;quot; in their area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Brown bag&amp;quot; safety video conferences are conducted by the CEO and recorded for later viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	11.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Superintendent(s) teach an 8-hour class on effective safety dialog with crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	12.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Stop work&amp;quot; award letters from the CEO are given to employees who take action to stop and correct an unsafe activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	13.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Presidents&amp;#39; safety walks are conducted quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	14.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Field managers must log a minimum of 16 hours of continuing safety education each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	15.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Supervisory employees are trained to be &amp;quot;competent persons&amp;quot; for all work activities, even for work they may not supervise directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	16.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A supervisory &amp;quot;safety resource desk&amp;quot; with a computer and a library of safety references is maintained at the job trailer to help supervisors learn about safety issues on their own. When supervisors find answers on their own rather than being told what to do, they learn and retain more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	17.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Foremen and supervisory employees receive &amp;quot;soft skills&amp;quot; training on how to handle common people issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	18.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In-house trainers receive training on improving speaking and team-building skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	19.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Operations managers investigate all incidents/accidents as opposed to the safety department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	20.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After project completion, employees who will lose their jobs receive free OSHA training for goodwill, new job marketability and prevention of fraudulent workers&amp;#39; compensation claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	21.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Monthly job-site safety discussions are hosted and led by the superintendent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	22.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Any incident with the project must be reported to the CEO and safety director the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	23.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A &amp;quot;no crew left unsupervised&amp;quot; program is implemented to make sure all crews receive the planning and safety management they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	24.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Senior management makes the commitment to shake at least 10 workers hands three times a month and talk about a specific safety item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	25.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Employees have access to &amp;quot;improve it&amp;quot; cards that follow the company&amp;#39;s safety-improvement philosophy of, &amp;quot;You said it; we did it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	26.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Employees carry &amp;quot;stop work&amp;quot; cards signed by the CEO in their wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	27.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An executive safety task force conducts monthly safety audits, with the highest scoring jobs winning a safety BBQ each quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	28.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Adopt the motto of &amp;quot;left of zero&amp;quot; to focus on prevention and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	29.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After the first 250 hours of work, new employees are brought back through the process to see how they feel about safety and what the company should do differently in terms of bringing on new employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	30.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Supervisors have an annual safety retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	31.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; New employees are not allowed at dangerous heights until deemed properly trained by their supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	32.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Surprise mock OSHA inspections are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	33.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Management accepts responsibility for a &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; that causes an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	34.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All supervisors are required to attend a behavior-based safety course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	35.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Management performs unannounced job tours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	36. &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Safety&amp;quot; is in the job title of all supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	37.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Visit employees at home if they have been injured on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	38.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Safety stand-downs are held twice a year to develop a strategic plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	39.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Do not support &amp;quot;silence&amp;quot; on safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>4 Arkansas Employers Cited for Fatal Crane Collapse at Nuclear Power Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Precision Surveillance Corp., Bigge Crane and Rigging Co., Siemens Power Generation Inc. and Entergy Operations Inc. for 26 safety violations after one Precision Surveillance worker was fatally injured when a crane collapsed at the Arkansas Nuclear One Power Plant in March. Eight other workers were hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Precision Surveillance Corp. is being cited for one serious violation with a penalty of $6,300 for failing to provide an effective communication system to alert the operator or signalman through an emergency stop signal. Bigge Crane and Rigging Co., Siemens Power Generation Inc. and Entergy Operations Inc. are being cited for failing to comply with crane-related hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bigge Crane was cited for nine serious violations with a penalty of $56,700, while Siemens was cited for nine serious violations with a penalty of $63,000. Entergy is being cited for seven serious violations with a penalty of $49,000. Proposed penalties for all violations total $175,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This tragedy could have been prevented had the employer ensured vital safeguards to protect workers from potential hazards and proper planning for a project of this magnitude,&amp;quot; said Carlos Reynolds, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Little Rock, Ark. &amp;quot;OSHA will hold the employers accountable for not meeting their workplace safety and health responsibilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Good Housekeeping is Essential for a Safe Workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whether I am auditing a facility or onsite to defend against Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) matters, housekeeping is quite literally the first thing that I consider. In 30 years, I have yet to find an occasion where poor housekeeping did not translate to or foreshadow a variety of cultural, leadership and compliance problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There should always be a standard of good housekeeping, even if you are at a waterlogged mud hole of a construction site or an alloy plant. No company is exempt from the requirement to maintain good housekeeping, although the standard for a cement plant is a tad different than for a technology-based employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Legal Standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA maintains standards on a wide variety of bathroom-related and hygiene issues for general industry, construction and other settings. OSHA seldom cites for these standards, but when they do, either the employers forgot that a bathroom was still in use or they truly do not care about employees. Employers should not underestimate the effect of filthy restrooms and especially showers on morale. Such issues are often a key complaint in union drives. However, filthy bathrooms are a more specific issue. I&amp;#39;m talking about how a construction site looks when you drive onsite or a plant floor as you enter the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s standard 1910.22(a)(1) states, &amp;quot;All places of employment, passageways, storerooms and service rooms shall be kept clean and orderly and in a sanitary condition.&amp;quot; OSHA also maintains standards on a variety of walking and working surfaces, access to extinguishers and electric panels, or related to egress and exit. As you might expect, OSHA&amp;#39;s principal focus is on trip hazards, exposed nails and sharp objects, blocked access, combustible dust accumulation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When OSHA compliance officers see lousy housekeeping, you know they will more closely scrutinize training and audit requirements, lockout and handling chemicals. They figure that if you don&amp;#39;t care enough to fix broken control-room windows, pick up discarded broken tools or stage materials properly on a jobsite, you aren&amp;#39;t likely to ring the bell with your powered industrial truck training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It also looks bad when you get cited for &amp;quot;housekeeping,&amp;quot; especially if it really is for sanitary reasons. A site has to be pretty nasty to earn a 1910.22(a)(1) citation where no trip or similar hazard is presented. By the way, the blocked exit or fire extinguisher on the floor type items have cost many retailers hundreds of thousands of dollars in citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Consequences of Poor Housekeeping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Housekeeping sets the tone. If the workplace doesn&amp;#39;t focus on housekeeping, employees, vendors and others will not care about it or any other area requiring purposeful action not narrowly related to &amp;quot;production.&amp;quot; Therefore, you can assume that continuous quality improvement won&amp;#39;t readily occur, and safety processes will only be written procedures with little day-to-day effect on work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some construction studies conclude that on a &amp;quot;messy&amp;quot; jobsite, materials get moved and restaged six to seven times for no good reason. How can you instill accountability in your frontline supervision, and how can you build an engaged employee culture where employees do the &amp;quot;right thing&amp;quot; regardless of whether someone is watching them? Seemingly little things matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3 Steps for Better Housekeeping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Become purposeful. Define &amp;quot;good housekeeping,&amp;quot; make a written plan, establish cleaning schedules, build an accountability structure and add housekeeping categories to self-audits. Do not assume that your normal housekeeping employees or operators will get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Train supervisors to be sensitive to issues that destroy morale and a productive culture. Come up with supervisor-driven processes for them to discuss these issues. Include housekeeping in employee attitude surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Use housekeeping as an early warning sign for a host of labor and employment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, cleanliness is next to ... profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/qO8TsjOWebA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Distracted Workers Affect Productivity and Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Several groups have waged a years-long campaign to restrict driver texting and other distractions. Hopefully, by now we are all aware that it makes little difference whether you use a hand-held or hands-free device. Indeed, a wide variety of tasks and technologies can affect you behind the wheel. Even listening to music can distract a driver, so we should not focus solely on hand-held phone usage and texting. But what if we apply the &amp;quot;distraction&amp;quot; analysis to determine why employees act in an unsafe fashion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although I have not yet fully researched the broader subject of &amp;quot;distracted workers,&amp;quot; most of what I have read has focused on the enormous loss of productivity. For example, Fox Business recently reported the results of a survey that found &amp;quot;nearly 60 percent of work interruptions involve tools like e-mail, social media, text messaging and instant messaging, as well as switching windows among standalone tools and applications. The survey also found that 45 percent of employees work for only 15 minutes at a time or less without being interrupted, and 53 percent waste at least one hour a day due to various distractions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the Canadian Occupational Safety Magazine article, &amp;quot;From Distracted Drivers to Distracted Workers,&amp;quot; points out that the distractions of cell-phone use are not limited to driving but are also vital to the safety of workers, particularly in high-risk areas like a construction site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what are we doing about it? Some employers now ban cell phones from industrial and construction settings. I can understand this approach because I have handled more than one case where an employee took a cell call and then returned to his electrical work without putting his gloves back on. But what about work sites where the employees must use their phones to obtain guidance from the home office, to call emergency responders or to conduct online job safety analysis or use other safety apps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, have we broadened our focus from vehicle operation and from cell phones? Where else is distraction contributing to injuries? In this age of multi-tasking, we already know that we are losing concentration and analytical ability in part due to our &amp;quot;labor-saving&amp;quot; devices, but are we also creating more safety hazards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems to me that a first step is to increasingly introduce the broader topic of distracted workers into our discussions and with our employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/CqCsJWMLdck" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA Announces Top 10 Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently announced the top 10 most-cited workplace safety violations at the 2013 National Safety Council Congress and Expo in Chicago. Once again, fall protection topped the list with 8,241 violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We appreciate our colleagues at OSHA sharing their most recent data as we look toward leading safety into the future,&amp;quot; said National Safety Council president and CEO Janet Froetscher. &amp;quot;Today&amp;#39;s presentation reminds us that it&amp;#39;s very important to learn from the past and address these top violations to help make our workplaces safer.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hazard communication was second on the list of top violations, followed by scaffolding, respiratory protection, electrical/wiring methods, powered industrial trucks and ladders. Rounding out the top 10 were lockout/tagout, electrical/general requirements and machine guarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The preliminary figures for the 2013 fiscal year are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>DuPont Wins National Safety Council Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The National Safety Council recently named DuPont as the winner of the 2013 Robert W. Campbell Award. The award is presented annually to organizations that integrate environmental, health and safety (EHS) management with business operations as a cornerstone of corporate success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;DuPont is honored to be named the 2013 recipient of the Robert W. Campbell Award,&amp;quot; said DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman. &amp;quot;For more than 200 years, DuPont core values, including safety and health, have been the cornerstone of who we are and what we stand for. This commitment has helped us grow into the organization we are today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Promoted by a network of 21 international partners, the Campbell Award recognizes world-class organizations around the globe. DuPont will be deeply involved in the award&amp;#39;s ongoing educational efforts, including the development of a case study sharing its success and best practices for use by top business and engineering schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Campbell Award, it is an honor to recognize DuPont and its multi-faceted approach to EHS management,&amp;quot; said Janet Froetscher, National Safety Council president and CEO. &amp;quot;We think it is commendable that DuPont is working to be the world&amp;#39;s most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer and healthier life for people everywhere.

            <title>Rockline Plant Receives Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Rockline Industries&amp;#39; manufacturing facility in Springdale, Ark., was recently presented an award from the Arkansas Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Division for achieving 3 million safe working hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The award recognizes companies whose employees have accumulated 3 million work hours without a lost day away from work due to a work-related injury or illness. Rockline is the only company in the state to reach 3 million safe work hours in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the factors contributing to Rockline&amp;#39;s success has been the company&amp;#39;s proactive behavioral-based safety program, which trains employees to observe work tasks and provide immediate safety feedback to those involved. It also trains production team members to serve as safety coordinators who help improve training and communication at a smaller, teachable team level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The health and safety of our employees is a top priority for Rockline Industries,&amp;quot; said Rockline&amp;#39;s Ella Shackelford. &amp;quot;As a team, we have worked incredibly hard to reach the 3-million-safe-work-hours mark, and we owe our success to the employees who put a strong emphasis on both individual and team safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Sheboygan, Wis., Rockline Industries manufactures coffee filters and wet wipes. The company employs approximately 2,000 people worldwide and has manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, Arkansas, New Jersey, England and China.

            <title>South Dakota Plant to Pay $1.33 Million for Worker's Death</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Adams Thermal Systems Inc. recently entered into an agreement with the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office and the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to pay more than $1.33 million to resolve criminal penalties and OSHA fines levied as a result of a worker&amp;#39;s death on Nov. 7, 2011, at the company&amp;#39;s plant in Canton, S.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the agreement, the company will pay the worker&amp;#39;s surviving spouse $450,000, a criminal fine of $450,000 and the full OSHA fine of $435,000 stemming from the regulatory violations that caused the fatality and additional violations discovered in subsequent inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s investigation found the worker was fatally crushed in a machine used to make radiator cores after management instructed and authorized workers to bypass the manufacturer&amp;#39;s barrier guard in order to adjust the machine to keep it running. OSHA also conducted two concurrent safety and health investigations at the company in February 2012, which resulted in 66 violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Adams Thermal failed to provide a safe workplace, and those conditions ultimately took the life of a worker,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;quot;There is no excuse for an employer to compromise safety to keep production running. The Department of Labor has worked diligently with the Office of the United States Attorney for South Dakota to resolve this case and provide justice to the family of this worker. No one should ever lose their life for a job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because the willful violations cited by OSHA caused the worker&amp;#39;s death, the case was referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Dakota in November 2012 for criminal prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The agreement resolves both of the OSHA civil cases and includes significant enhanced abatement of violations by the company. Adams Thermal Systems agreed to increase the size of its safety and health department, implement a companywide safety and health program, provide incentives for managers and workers to report safety issues and make safety recommendations, and to hire a qualified third-party to review guarding and lockout/tagout for all plant machinery and to audit the abatement of all identified hazards. The company will also report quarterly to OSHA for three years on safety progress and reportable illnesses and injuries, as well as redesign the safety systems and procedures on the radiator core machine involved in the fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The agreement will resolve three willful citations issued for $210,000 as a result of the fatality investigation. The settlement also resolves the additional citations issued following two concurrent comprehensive safety and health inspections with proposed penalties of $225,000. The comprehensive safety and health cases involved 58 serious violations and eight other-than-serious violations addressing unlabeled piping systems, obstructions in aisles and passageways, unguarded machinery, crane and hoist hazards, improper exits, electrical hazards and exposure to chemicals, dust and noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA placed Adams Thermal Systems, which manufactures engine cooling systems for off-highway and on-highway vehicles, in its severe violator enforcement program as a result of these inspections. The program mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law. The program focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tired Workers Jeopardize Workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I have always assumed that exhaustion affects our judgment, makes us sloppy and unsafe, and more prone to anger. Behavioral research supports my assumptions. Perhaps our first wellness step should be a campaign to get employees to sleep &amp;hellip; and to follow our own advice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Christopher M. Barnes posted a provocative blog titled, &amp;quot;Sleep-Deprived People Are More Likely to Cheat,&amp;quot; on the Harvard Business Review Blog Network. Barnes pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The workplace has many temptations that employees must resist, from the petty impulse to claim credit for someone else&amp;#39;s work, to the unscrupulous lapse of lying in a negotiation context, to the criminal act of misrepresenting financial numbers. Recent research indicates that self-control is a key determinant of whether or not people fall to or resist such temptations. When their ability to exert self-control is high, they can resist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	University of Kentucky professor and DeWall Lab director Dr. C. Nathan DeWall has lectured and written on self-control and &amp;ldquo;self-regulation depletion.&amp;rdquo; To grossly oversimplify some of his conclusions, he has documented how metabolic depletion (lack of energy) and sleep deprivation limit one&amp;#39;s self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Barnes also cites various researchers who have established that the act of using self-control draws upon this fuel, which exhausts the fuel. Thus, one&amp;#39;s ability to exert self-control can become depleted. Even a limited number of occasions of not getting enough sleep can influence ethical decision-making. It goes without saying that sleep deprivation also affects the judgment and reflexes often required to work safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why don&amp;#39;t employees get enough rest? In my case, it is often pure macho arrogance. I ran in college and was a distance runner and mixed martial arts fighter until I was 50. I dismissed concerns that a lack of sleep would catch up with me. I was wrong. I don&amp;#39;t know about women, but I suspect that this &amp;quot;manly contempt&amp;quot; causes many men to ignore that common-sense voice imploring them to get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other reasons include working multiple jobs or ignorance about the effect of even modest under-sleeping. Many of us have also convinced ourselves that we are virtuous for &amp;quot;sacrificing&amp;quot; ourselves in order to complete needed tasks or to serve others or our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As employers, we cannot necessarily address employees having to work more than one job or the harsh demands of our ever-changing society. However, we can educate employees and encourage rest, and perhaps consider such needs in our staffing and strategic decisions. As a wise old coach once told me, &amp;quot;Rest is training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Action Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Set a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Emphasize sleep in wellness programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Consider fatigue and lack of sleep in incident investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Research shows that lack of sleep can contribute to prejudice, so this issue may affect a wide range of investigations of employee behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5. Consider how you, the employer, can assist employees in getting better sleep, such as through scheduling, staffing and more effective management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6. Incorporate the subject into supervisor development and employee training. Address the self-imposed attitudes leading to poor decisions about sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7. Include &amp;quot;self-control&amp;quot; in your investigation of why an employee violated rules, engaged in potentially harassing behavior or reacted inappropriately to a supervisor. You may determine a way to counsel and improve the employee, or you may decide that the underlying self-control issues warrant parting ways. Just don&amp;#39;t treat judgment and self-control as psychological or disability issues. We&amp;#39;re talking about everyday normal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/1yCneEY_a4o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Safety Concerns for Remote Employees</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many employees work alone at a customer&amp;#39;s site or on the road with no immediate supervision or the presence of a safety professional to check for hazards. Some workers, such as journeymen electricians and certified crane operators, are trained to operate with minimal supervision. Other workers may be less trained or less equipped to individually analyze their setting. Unfortunately, both types of isolated workers may violate OSHA standards, and preventing that misconduct is more of a problem when employees are working alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers have a duty to ensure their employees&amp;#39; safety even when the employer has no supervision or safety professionals onsite. In almost all situations, the employer cannot delegate this responsibility to others for even the most skilled workers. A balance must be struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many employers fail to establish programs to effectively supervise these often highly skilled employees, although some have a solid system in which employees confer throughout the day with supervisors, dispatchers and technicians. Even if the employer has trained employees to exercise greater responsibility when working alone, are these procedures documented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the practical need to ensure employee safety, OSHA may cite employers for inadequate safety measures when remote employees are hurt. Consider how your operation would look in a &amp;ldquo;Monday morning quarterback&amp;rdquo; scenario. OSHA may envision supervision or a safety professional checking on the work or surveying the site. Such actions may not be practical for businesses such as a ready-mix delivery or a skilled technician working alone on controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers must continuously remind employees to always pause, consider the site or job&amp;#39;s hazards and take steps to avoid these hazards. Of course, this is how all employees are expected to operate, but with isolated employees, you must drum this into their heads and devise processes to remind them to take this approach. For these workers, emphasize their unique role of having to conduct their own site safety or hazard analysis. One employer described the &amp;ldquo;TRACK&amp;rdquo; mantra their employees follow, which includes stop and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Think through the task&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recognize the hazards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assess the risks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control the hazards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep safety in all tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under construction OSHA standards 1926.20 and 21, an employer must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain accident-prevention programs providing for frequent and regular inspections of the job sites, materials and equipment to be made by competent persons.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do employers meet their obligations when no supervisory or safety personnel accompany the workers? Possible actions might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Documenting thorough training to equip employees to recognize and avoid hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determining the probable range of hazards employees may encounter at various types of jobs and documenting that they actually carried out such an analysis. Many jobs and sites are similar, and it should be possible to determine the routine hazards. Now, go a step further and consider &amp;ldquo;non-routine&amp;rdquo; hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establishing a rule, procedure or form that requires supervision to pause when assigning employees to non-routine jobs or assigning employees to jobs with which they are less familiar. In these situations, additional training or some type of safety analysis may be necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Requiring employees to at least complete a very basic and brief site safety analysis for those small remote jobs. Many electrical and other specialized contractors require employees to complete a few questions on the work-order paperwork requiring the employee to pause and consider hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Using tablets or phone apps for the hazard analysis and as a means of tracking compliance and providing advice.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing procedures for employers to call in whenever they have any questions or concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spot-checking line crews, technicians, deliveries or small crews. Do you conduct any sort of quality spot-checks or inspect the final work?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Considering safety concerns unique to each site, such as lockout for electricians and skylights for those working on roofs or overhead power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensuring that job safety analyses (JSAs) are thorough, accurate and consider challenges posed by customer sites.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Making sure employees know that you will back them if they refuse unsafe demands by customers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Holding a regular teleconference if remote employees seldom report to a site where safety and other concerns can be regularly addressed. Many remote workers may work from home or travel from hotel to hotel.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Ford Launches Sustainable Workforce Initiative to Boost Productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford recently launched a new sustainable workforce initiative meant to ensure the long-term health, efficiency and productivity of the company&amp;#39;s most important asset &amp;ndash; its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ford could not exist without all of our hard-working employees, so it&amp;#39;s important for us to do everything in our power to provide a safe and sustainable work environment,&amp;quot; said Jim Tetreault, vice president, Ford North America manufacturing. &amp;quot;Through our sustainable workforce initiative, we&amp;#39;re taking a new, holistic approach to fostering growth and well-being amongst our workers, and making sure Ford is a great place to build a career over the long term.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The goal of the initiative is to keep hourly employees healthy and safe throughout their Ford careers. The initiative focuses on four components: high-performance hiring, advanced training, protection and safety, and health and well-being for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	High-performance Hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the initiative, Ford&amp;#39;s human resources team will determine which candidates are likely to be high performers based on a comprehensive test that looks at skills, abilities and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We look at what candidates can do as well as what they will do,&amp;quot; said Tetreault. &amp;quot;Factors associated with motivation &amp;ndash; work ethic, conscientiousness and teamwork &amp;ndash; are just as important in an effective employee as skills and abilities such as reading, arithmetic, defect spotting and manual assembly. Looking at candidates from both perspectives allows us to better select potential high performers who we want working with us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Advanced Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After strategic hiring, training is crucial to ensure new hourly employees are prepared to work safely and efficiently. Base operators receive several weeks of training &amp;ndash; a combination of classroom, simulated factory and hands-on factory work. Semi-skilled operators receive up to six months of training, and skilled trades training has increased to more than six months, or up to nine months prior to a model launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simulated factory training, which was developed at Ford&amp;#39;s Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, has expanded to the Flat Rock assembly plant in Michigan in preparation for the start of Ford Fusion production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This training process, which provides workers with hands-on training in a real-world work environment, has been so successful that it is now considered a global standard and is being implemented in our plants worldwide,&amp;quot; said Tetreault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Protection and Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1999, Ford revamped its safety program to create global safety process standards. Employees must &amp;quot;stop, think and plan&amp;quot; before taking on any task, whether it&amp;#39;s replacing a light bulb or a production task on the assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By having our employees analyze the task before any work begins, we are able to better prevent safety incidents in our facilities,&amp;quot; said Tetreault. &amp;quot;Overall injury rates have dropped to one-tenth of the levels of 1999, and our lost-time case rate is just a fraction of what it was in 2000.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To identify ergonomic issues early and reduce the risk of chronic repetitive motion injuries, Ford conducts virtual ergonomic assessments in its virtual factory. Resolving issues before the production of physical parts plays a significant role in keeping employees safe in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Since implementation of our virtual factory, the number of ergonomic issues during physical builds has been greatly reduced,&amp;quot; said Tetreault. &amp;quot;So far in 2013, our days away and restricted time rate has fallen to less than one-sixth of where it was in 2001, and we continue to make progress.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Health and Well-being for Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensuring employees&amp;#39; long-term health is the final step in maintaining a sustainable workforce. To improve the health-care experience and outcome for hourly employees with the greatest need, Ford recently announced its Enhanced Care Program. This voluntary two-year pilot program uses a personalized care approach to help eligible participants manage chronic health-care needs and prevent future problems when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our hourly worker population tends to be more high risk, to have more chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, and to use preventive services less often compared with the national average,&amp;quot; said Tetreault. &amp;quot;As health-care spending continues to increase, Ford, the UAW and health-care providers continue to work together to develop and promote programs that will maintain or improve employees&amp;#39; health while reducing costs at the same time. We think the goal is imminently achievable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Common-sense Approach to Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Why is common sense so uncommon? Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I make a handsome living in part because common sense is anything but common. However, I like to prevent labor and employment problems, and I would do anything to reduce the number of workplace deaths, so I ponder this question a great deal. In this article, I will leave the psychological, sociological and anthropological analysis to more thoughtful people than me and instead will settle for just throwing out some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Stop to Consider What Safety Hazards are Presented by the Next Task and Act Accordingly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If every worker consistently took this approach to safety, there would be far fewer injuries and deaths, and I would have to get an honest job. Safety must be reinforced continuously, or workers will become complacent and cut corners. I have repeatedly seen employees nonchalantly take unreasonable risks less than six months after they were emotionally torn apart by the death of a co-worker. While it is important to provide the details on confined-space entry and site-specific fall protection, you must also build the simple &amp;ldquo;pause and think&amp;rdquo; mindset into employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps more commitment to performing the required job safety analysis (JSA) could be achieved if employees understood that JSAs or job hazard assessments (JHAs) are simply a way to give them the necessary information to make wise decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if you are a construction employer working under the broad requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations 1926.20-21 or if OSHA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;quot;I2P2&amp;quot; becomes law, it is impossible to develop a written procedure for every work eventuality. Workers must be taught to always pause and conduct their own quick JHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This informal, ongoing job hazard analysis is especially vital for remote workers or employees delivering ready-mix concrete or working on an isolated HVAC system where no supervisor or safety professional is present to review the site for hazards and instruct them in avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For these types of employees, it might be a good idea to require them to conduct a hazard analysis on their tablet before proceeding. Sure, employees can still pencil-whip such an electronic form, but at least it may make them pause and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On a pragmatic level, employers cannot escape their duty to ensure their employees are safe even when they are working alone on another employer&amp;rsquo;s site. Such a procedure may be documentation of the employer&amp;rsquo;s reasonable diligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/aGMmYAUqX-o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Concrete Manufacturer Cited for Health and Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited concrete products manufacturer Tileco Inc. in Kapolei, Hawaii, with 23 violations of workplace safety and health standards carrying proposed fines of $50,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 22 serious violations included failing to evaluate workplace hazards adequately, protect workers from amputation hazards associated with unguarded machinery and gears, protect workers from the unexpected startup of equipment during maintenance and setup, protect workers from confined space hazards, provide training on the use of powered industrial trucks, have in place a written respiratory program, ensure the proper fit and use of respirators, and have medical evaluations for workers using respiratory protection. In addition, there were fall hazards associated with unprotected platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA also cited Tileco Inc. for one other-than-serious violation for conducting a modification to a powered industrial truck without approval from the manufacturer. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings to the independent occupational safety and health review commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Every worker has the right to a workplace free of hazards, and all employers have the responsibility to ensure hazards are identified and corrected,&amp;quot; said Galen Lemke, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Honolulu area office. &amp;quot;An employer shouldn&amp;#39;t wait for an OSHA inspection to address workplace safety and health issues to prevent injury and illnesses.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Trailer Manufacturer Cited for 15 Serious Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Quality Trailers Enterprise Inc. with 15 serious safety violations, including a lack of personal protective equipment and exposing workers to machine guarding hazards, at its trailer manufacturing facility in Salem, Ohio. Proposed fines from the complaint inspection total $55,300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Quality Trailers Enterprises has a responsibility to train and protect workers from known hazards, such as noise and machinery in its manufacturing facility,&amp;quot; said Howard Eberts, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Cleveland. &amp;quot;OSHA is committed to common-sense safety and health regulations, which protect workers on the job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ten serious safety violations involve lack of machine guarding, failing to develop a lockout/tagout program to control the release of hazardous energy while servicing and maintaining equipment, lack of fire-extinguisher training, failing to train workers in the operation of powered industrial trucks, not providing welding shields and curtains, and exposing workers to live wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, five serious health violations were cited for exposure to noise, lack of personal protective equipment, improper oxygen-cylinder storage, allowing combustible paint residue to accumulate in the paint booth, and failing to conduct a workplace hazard-assessment program and to develop and train workers on a hazard-communication program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and notice of proposed penalties to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. If the company does not file or contest within that period, it must abate the cited conditions within the period ordered in the citations and pay the proposed penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Creating a Workplace Safety Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Culture can be defined as the behaviors and beliefs that are characteristic of a particular group. It is the culture that has a significant influence on the strategies and decisions &amp;mdash; and their consequences &amp;mdash; of that group. Just as the culture of Al Qaeda had an influence on the suicide bombers in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the culture in a workplace will influence the decisions of managers and supervisors in relation to workplace safety. Consequently, it is the likelihood of danger, injuries and loss that is affected by this culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Safety at all Levels of Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Governments, independent bodies and institutions are persistent in finding ways to reduce workplace risk. Business owners often introduce measures to reduce workplace risk. However, unless the culture in the workplace is right, these introduced measures will have little or no impact at all. Therefore, it is imperative for the organization to create the right workplace safety culture that is practiced by all members of the organization from the highest level down to the bottom. Cultures are not created overnight. Neither are they created by one single action. Instead, they are developed over a period of time &amp;mdash; sometimes weeks, sometimes months and sometimes years &amp;mdash; and are established through a vast variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Staff Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An effective means of creating a positive workplace safety culture is to introduce programs and training for staff at every level of the organization. By ensuring all employees who begin employment are immediately trained in the policies and procedures regarding workplace safety and participate in programs that assist them in increasing their awareness of the importance of safety, they immediately have the sense that this organization places a high priority on safety. They feel that they are empowered with the knowledge of how to ensure their workplace is kept safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Right Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complementing training programs, actual equipment and facilities that ensure the workplace is kept safe are also essential. By having the facilities available, staff and other members will feel at no disadvantage in keeping the workplace safe. Legal requirements also stipulate particular items that must be purchased to keep workplaces safe. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.fortressfencing.com.au/index.php?p=temporary-fencing-accessories"&gt;temporary fencing&lt;/a&gt; is required for certain construction work. However, by going beyond the requirements in providing additional equipment, the organization sends a positive message to the people interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Discipline for Bad Behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, rigorous training, innovative safety programs and fancy posters and slogans are often forgotten, and bad behavior quickly and insidiously creeps in. If this bad behavior is not corrected, a good culture can turn into a very poor culture. It is important that there are penalties for bad behavior to discipline people who may contribute to tarnishing a good culture as well as incentives for good behavior. This will encourage all members to continue to practice good behavior that promotes a right safety culture, not only due to the fear of punishment for bad behavior but also to realize that the organization is serious in its belief that workplace safety is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complete participation is also essential. As humans, we are always influenced by our peers and the people we admire. Therefore, if managers implement safety procedures but do not follow them, or if supervisors or team leaders display a poor attitude toward safety, the right culture will never be created. However, if all employees can see a clear support of workplace safety from every level of the organization, the success in creating a right workplace culture will have exponential results. Actions speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, it is clear that no strategies can be implemented overnight, and neither can only one be used. Rather, through multiple innovative ideas that are practiced over a long period of time will the right safety culture be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/IIMw-ss0qQU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>4 Hypertherm Facilities Recognized as 'Star' Worksites for Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The United States Department of Labor recently recognized four Hypertherm facilities as &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; worksites as part of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The VPP star program recognizes the nation&amp;rsquo;s best workplaces for operating outstanding safety and health management systems for employee protection. It is OSHA&amp;rsquo;s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have created exemplary worksite safety and health management systems. These worksites are self-sufficient in identifying and controlling workplace hazards. To be recognized as a VPP star worksite, an employer must operate a comprehensive safety and health management system that is integrated into a worksite&amp;rsquo;s operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The latest four facilities to be recognized join two other Hypertherm worksites that have received OSHA&amp;rsquo;s VPP star designation. Hypertherm&amp;rsquo;s recognition as having multiple star worksites is based on an integrated management system&amp;rsquo;s approach to health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The cornerstone of our program is Hypertherm&amp;rsquo;s culture, which promotes associate involvement and teamwork at all levels of our organization,&amp;quot; said Hypertherm founder and CEO Dick Couch. &amp;quot;All team members work together to design workplace enhancements that will improve the overall well-being of all Hypertherm associates with an ultimate goal of zero workplace accidents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Hanover, N.H., Hypertherm designs and manufactures advanced cutting products for use in a variety of industries such as ship building, manufacturing and automotive repair.

            <title>Why Safety Requires Consistent Discipline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	An effective safety process requires consistent discipline to support other company safety efforts, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is aggressively suing employers for allegedly using safety rules to terminate employees for reporting workplace injuries. In fact, it often turns out that the only employees terminated for safety violations were those terminated for unsafe behavior after an injury. Why? The employer was sloppy about disciplining employees for unsafe behavior, and the only time the employers &amp;ldquo;caught&amp;rdquo; employees acting unsafely was when investigating the injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers seldom successfully assert the &amp;quot;unpreventable employee misconduct/isolated incident&amp;quot; affirmative defense to employee OSHA violations because they cannot prove they manage an effective safety program that includes documented safety rules or procedures, proof that the employee was trained, evidence of the employer&amp;rsquo;s efforts to monitor and enforce the safety program, or past discipline for unsafe behavior (more than a verbal warning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers generally cannot show the element of regular safety-related discipline. Even the most safety-conscious employers admit that they don&amp;rsquo;t adequately use discipline. Fisher and Phillips&amp;#39; 2012-2013 survey of large general contractors with some of the nation&amp;rsquo;s best safety programs revealed that 56 percent were &amp;quot;not satisfied by how often supervisors discipline employees for unsafe behavior.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To give you an idea of just how well these respondents are doing in other more costly safety efforts, consider the following survey results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		43 percent provide 30-hour OSHA training to more than 75 percent of supervisors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		59 percent formally include safety in executive performance evaluations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		61 percent use observation systems requiring supervisors to make regular observations of compliance and non-compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, over half of some of the most safety-oriented employers admit that safety-related discipline is not where it should be. Why is this? Various surveys list one of the following reasons why supervisors do not discipline employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors are afraid they will get their employers in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They haven&amp;rsquo;t been trained and don&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They came up through the ranks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Discipline is only discussed when something bad happens, like a lawsuit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another question from Fisher and Phillips&amp;rsquo; survey supplies a partial answer as to why most companies make almost no consistent effort to train supervisors on when and how to discipline employees.&amp;nbsp;The question was &amp;quot;How often do you provide &amp;#39;HR&amp;#39; training to frontline supervisors?&amp;quot; The results were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rarely &amp;mdash; 37 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Occasionally &amp;mdash; 25 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Annually &amp;mdash; 22 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More than once a year &amp;mdash; 7 percent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We have a formal supervisory program or company &amp;quot;university&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; 7 percent&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So only 7 percent maintain a formal supervisory training program, and another 7 percent provide HR-training more than once per year. I believe these results make it clear as to what action the majority of companies need to take in order to achieve a more effective safety program. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/I5mfxn30kZM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Road Systems Receives Plant Safety Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Road Systems Inc. (RSI) was recently honored with the 2012 Plant Safety Award from the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA). This is the third straight year and fourth time that RSI has received this honor from TTMA; the company was also an award recipient in 2004, 2010 and 2011. RSI was recognized for the achievement at the TTMA Annual Convention in Point Clear, Ala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the TTMA Plant Safety program, award winners are selected from member companies&amp;#39; year-long occupational injury data recorded in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) record-keeping requirements. RSI won in the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; category of the award segmented for plants sized 300,000 man-hours and under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be considered for the award, RSI was responsible for providing numerical data in seven areas: deaths, total lost workday cases, total cases with job transfer or restriction, days away from work, days of job transfer or job restriction, total number of other recordable cases and total cases (of injuries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since receiving its first Plant Safety Award in 2004, RSI not only has decreased its incident frequency rate by more than 400 percent but also grown by 110 employees during that time. One of RSI&amp;#39;s secrets to success is its behavior-based strategy, which produces results that improve every year. For example, outfitted with bright orange shirts to signify the need for additional attention, new employees are placed on a six-month probationary period where all plant personnel are responsible for monitoring their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The team approach to mentoring and monitoring each other&amp;#39;s safety performance makes a much bigger impact than simply a directive from a supervisor,&amp;quot; stated Lynn Reinbolt, RSI&amp;rsquo;s president. &amp;quot;This award is a product of our belief that safety is an individual behavior that succeeds only with support from one&amp;#39;s colleagues. We have a great team, and I could not be more proud of our achievements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year marks the 42nd presentation of the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards. TTMA is a member-based organization established to build confidence between manufacturers of truck trailers, cargo tanks, intermodal containers and their suppliers to bring about a mutual understanding of the problems confronting all manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;There is a reason that RSI is consistently on top of their category year after year,&amp;quot; said Jeff Sims, president of the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association. &amp;quot;Their commitment to safety has been unparalleled. They truly set the standard for others to emulate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A subsidiary of Con-way Inc., RSI designs, builds and sells freight trailers and other equipment to its sister transportation and logistics operating companies within the Con-way organization. With its production operations and reputation for quality manufacturing, the company has also established a growing presence as a supplier of trailing equipment to customers across the transportation and logistics marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AK Steel Plant Recognized for Outstanding Safety Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel&amp;#39;s Coshocton Works has been recognized for outstanding safety performance by the Ohio Bureau of Workers&amp;#39; Compensation, Division of Safety and Hygiene. The recognition is part of a collaborative safety awareness program established by the Coshocton County Safety Council and Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is an honor to be recognized by the Ohio Bureau of Workers&amp;#39; Compensation, Division of Safety and Hygiene, an achievement that speaks volumes about our culture of safety at AK Steel,&amp;quot; said James L. Wainscott, chairman, president and CEO of AK Steel. &amp;quot;We congratulate all of our Coshocton Works employees for their outstanding safety performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel&amp;#39;s Coshocton Works received the &amp;quot;100% Award for Safety&amp;quot; for operating all of 2012 without any lost-time injuries or illnesses. The plant also received a &amp;quot;Special Award for Safety&amp;quot; for operating 1,126,942 man-hours without a lost-time injury between Aug. 5, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2012. In addition, Coshocton Works received the &amp;quot;Group Safety Award&amp;quot; for having the lowest incident rate in the industrial group and earned the &amp;quot;Safety Achievement Award&amp;quot; for reducing its lost-time injury rate by more than 25 percent over 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel&amp;#39;s corporate-wide safety performance was five times better than the steel industry average for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in West Chester, Ohio, AK Steel produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels primarily for automotive, infrastructure, manufacturing, construction, electrical power generation and distribution markets. The company employs about 6,100 people in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Indiana.

            <title>Georgia Manufacturer Cited for Repeat Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Tenneco Automotive Operating Co. has been cited for 13 safety and health violations by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration following an inspection at its manufacturing facility in Hartwell, Ga. Proposed fines total $62,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One repeat safety violation, with a penalty of $22,000, involves the employer failing to reduce the pressure in a compressed air device to less than 30 pounds per square inch when using it for cleaning. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. Tenneco was previously cited for this same violation during an inspection in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nine serious safety and health violations, with $37,800 in penalties, include the manufacturer exposing workers to burn hazards due to the accumulation of combustible dust and tripping hazards related to poor housekeeping in the wash area. The employer was also cited for failing to provide an eyewash station, face shields and chemical goggles for employees working with corrosive materials; not informing workers of the hazards of being exposed to noise beyond the permissible exposure limit; permitting a powered industrial truck with severely damaged tires to be utilized; allowing a worker to leave a loaded forklift unattended with the load raised; having an obstructed emergency exit; and multiple instances of inadequate machine guarding. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three other-than-serious violations, with $2,200 in penalties, involve failing to record threshold shifts on the OSHA 300 log, not having workers&amp;#39; hearing retested within 30 days when there was a threshold shift, and failing to properly log the number of restricted days when a worker experienced a hand contusion and another received a laceration. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Tenneco continues to put its workers at risk of serious injury or illness by exposing them to inadequate machine guarding, burn and trip hazards,&amp;quot; said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Atlanta-East area office. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s imperative that management is proactive in eliminating hazards from the workplace and doesn&amp;#39;t rely on an OSHA inspection to identify deficiencies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tenneco Automotive Co. is a division of Tenneco, a global transportation components manufacturer with more than 80 facilities on six continents. Corporate offices are in Lake Forest, Ill. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request a conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bad Choices Lead to Workplace Accidents</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	They may not know it at the time, but workers (and companies) make choices that result in workplace accidents. While there are many contributing factors to workplace accidents, on some level, bad decisions were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	J.A. Rodriquez recently wrote an interesting article titled &amp;quot;Fatalities at West Fertilizer Company: Was the Enemy of Safety Responsible?&amp;quot; It explained how workers engage in &amp;quot;incremental rationalization&amp;quot; to bit by bit justify ultimately disastrous decisions. He analogized to our common incremental justification for violating a diet, in which the rationalization proceeds from, &amp;quot;I know I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it,&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Maybe just this once,&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I deserve this,&amp;quot; and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have been associated with almost 500 workplace fatalities, and my partner, Ed Foulke, another 200 or so. We have analyzed these accidents, and close to 70 percent involved errors by well-trained personnel. Most of those individuals were described as solid, good people, among the best in the company, devoted family men and in similar terms, yet they made decisions that caused or contributed to their death and in some cases perhaps the deaths of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The common explanation is that we all become nonchalant about hazards to which we are exposed daily. However, Rodriquez further described this seeming nonchalance by stating that this mindset gradually develops over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies and their leaders share the blame for allowing a culture that tolerates this attitude. Sometimes entire businesses may engage in this stealthily creeping &amp;quot;incremental rationalization.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I frequently refer to &amp;quot;guy disease,&amp;quot; the seemingly endless capacity of males to make unwise and unsafe decisions despite clearly knowing better. Sorry guys, women may be open to criticism on other fronts, but they simply do not as readily bypass steps, cut corners or just make plain bone-headed mistakes. But even we chromosomally challenged males didn&amp;rsquo;t start cutting corners and becoming nonchalant about major safety issues. We got there slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Maintaining a Safety Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It comes back to that oft-used, seldom-understood term &amp;quot;culture.&amp;quot; It is incumbent on corporate leaders to create the type of culture in which employees are continually reminded to pause, think and make wise safety decisions. Continuously experiment; keep it interesting. Repetition is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Almost all executives state that safety is their first priority, and generally they mean it. However, many of the same leaders do not know much about their safety processes and are not focusing on safety in the same fashion they work to obtain the corporation&amp;rsquo;s other goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After experiencing a workplace fatality, serious injury or OSHA citation, executives may quickly grasp that it&amp;rsquo;s their responsibility to &amp;quot;change the safety culture.&amp;quot; We all know where the buck stops, but what is their culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers first need to determine their safety culture. An employee safety attitude survey is an effective tool for this. A recent Fisher and Phillips survey of some of the most safety-conscious employers found that only 16 percent regularly use such surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These surveys are used in other contexts, so why not use them for safety as well? Human resources-driven employee attitude surveys are less effective without safety inquiries, so perhaps questions about the safety culture can be incorporated into existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/zKWMS3HoLp0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Houston Plant Cited for Failing to Protect Workers from Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Texfab Inc. with 11 alleged serious and two other-than-serious violations for exposing workers to falls and other workplace hazards at its manufacturing plant on Link Drive in Navasota. OSHA&amp;#39;s Houston North Area Office began the investigation in March after receiving a complaint. Proposed penalties total $48,300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serious violations include a missing latch on a crane-lifting hook and fall hazards into a pit and into dangerous machinery. The company also failed to ensure usage of proper personal protective equipment, supply at least grade-D air in supply air respirators, equip air respirators with high-temperature or carbon-monoxide monitors, medically evaluate workers before they wear respirators, evaluate permit-required confined spaces, provide a lockout/tagout program to control energy sources, periodically inspect a gantry crane, and provide machine guarding on point of operation for all machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other-than-serious violations involve failing to provide a respirator-protection program and fit-test respirators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Employers must recognize the hazards that exist in their workplaces and then develop safety and health procedures to protect workers on the job,&amp;quot; said David Doucet, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director at the Houston North Area Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Texfab specializes in the manufacturing of cylinders that are later manufactured into pressure vessels for the oil and gas industry. It employs about 10 workers at the Navasota location and about 70 at its Cypress facility. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Aggregate Industries Earns Safety Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Aggregate Industries US, a Holcim Group company, recently announced that three of its facilities have received safety achievement awards from the Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals. The facilities were recognized for accomplishing a zero lost-time accident rate in 2012. This accomplishment is based on a company&amp;#39;s lost-time injuries (LTI) record. An LTI is defined as an accident that requires the employee to take time off for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We congratulate our employees for their accomplishment and unwavering attention to safety,&amp;quot; said Graham Hardwick, senior vice president of Aggregate Industries US Midwest Region. &amp;quot;They have shown great commitment to implementing the company&amp;#39;s universal safety measures and taking ownership for personal safety. We&amp;#39;re proud of their achievements and look forward to continued excellence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The three facilities that earned the awards were Dyer Lake Pit #34 in Burlington, Wis., Algonquin Pit #5 in Algonquin, Ill., and McHenry West Pit #26 in McHenry, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Aggregate Industries US is a leading provider of aggregate and construction materials to markets in 18 states and more than 300 cities.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ohio Manufacturer Cited after Worker's Finger is Amputated</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Smithville Manufacturing Co. in Wooster, Ohio, for 21 health and safety violations, including one willful, after receiving a complaint that a worker&amp;#39;s finger was amputated at the facility by an unguarded press machine. OSHA has proposed penalties of $65,800 as a result of the December 2012 inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The willful violation was cited for failing to ensure point of operation guards were in place on mechanical power presses at the stamping facility, which does short-run productions of automotive parts. A willful violation is one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law&amp;#39;s requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Smithville Manufacturing has a responsibility to follow all safety guidelines, including the use of properly adjusted and adequate machine guarding to protect workers from injuries, such as amputations,&amp;quot; said Howard Eberts, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Cleveland. &amp;quot;Employers must recognize the hazards that exist in their workplaces and develop safety and health policies and procedures to protect workers on the job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A total of 18 serious violations were cited, nine of which involve lack of or improperly adjusted guarding on equipment, such as shears, grinders, screw machines and drill and power presses. Other violations involve failing to establish and train workers on energy-control procedures, ensuring employees lock-out equipment prior to conducting maintenance or service, training workers on the use of fire extinguishers, establishing die-setting procedures, conducting weekly press inspections, developing a written hazard communication program, and training workers on the hazards of chemicals in the workplace. Two other-than-serious health violations were issued for failing to develop a written respiratory protection program and blood-borne pathogens program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Fuel Company Cited After Worker's Death</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Export Fuel Co. with 18 serious safety violations following the death of a worker who was crushed by a pavement roller in August 2012 at the company&amp;#39;s facility in Export, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Training workers to recognize and address hazards is essential, and Export Fuel failed to train its workers on the operation and maintenance of the pavement roller, which ultimately led to a worker&amp;#39;s death,&amp;quot; said Christopher Robinson, director of the OSHA Pittsburgh area office. &amp;quot;It is the employer&amp;#39;s responsibility to provide a safe workplace by finding and fixing hazards so all workers are protected.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serious violations include fall and electrical hazards, lack of machine and equipment guarding, lack of energy-control procedures, the company&amp;#39;s failure to provide employee training in the maintenance and operation of construction vehicles, and a safe exit and means of egress. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result and the employer knew or should have known of the hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proposed penalties total $41,300. Export Fuel has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director in Pittsburgh or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Illinois Plant Cited for Exposing Workers to Hazardous Materials</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Flex-N-Gate Corp., which operates as Guardian West in Urbana, Ill., with six serious safety violations for failing to protect workers from exposure to hazardous materials and provide adequate emergency response plans and training at the company&amp;#39;s bumper manufacturing plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inspection was initiated in July 2012 after OSHA received a complaint alleging workers were being exposed to high levels of hydrochloric acid following a release of the acid during refilling operations. Proposed fines total $41,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Manufacturers such as Guardian West, which are the subject of repeat complaint inspections, need to demonstrate a commitment to properly training and protecting workers from exposure to hazards,&amp;quot; said Tom Bielema, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Peoria, Ill. &amp;quot;OSHA is committed to protecting workers on the job, especially when employers fail to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three of the violations involve failing to ensure workers used protective equipment when exposed to hazards capable of causing injury and impairment. These included a lack of hand, eye and face protection for workers exposed to liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The remaining violations involve failing to include evacuation routes and procedures in the company&amp;#39;s emergency response and contingency plan and to ensure workers engaged in emergency response involving inhalation hazards were provided with breathing apparatus for respiratory protection and trained on adequate emergency response. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Flex-N-Gate employs more than 12,450 people at 50 manufacturing plants and nine product development and engineering facilities throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Spain. The Urbana plant was previously cited by OSHA in May 2012, which resulted in six serious violations. In December 2010, the inspection resulted in two serious violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>58 Health, Safety Violations Found at Hoover Dam Power Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)&amp;nbsp;found 50 alleged serious and eight repeat safety and health violations during a comprehensive investigation at the Hoover Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant located 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas. The U.S. Department of Interior&amp;#39;s Bureau of Reclamation maintains and operates the power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are concerned to have found this number of serious safety and health violations at the Hoover Dam plant,&amp;quot; said Ken Atha, OSHA&amp;#39;s regional administrator in San Francisco. &amp;quot;We expect to work closely with the agency to rectify these deficiencies and provide a safe and healthful work environment for employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 50 serious safety and health violations included fall and electrical hazards, a lack of required guards on machinery, inadequate personal protective equipment, lead contamination, and the potential for overexposure to hexavalent chromium. OSHA also identified violations for failing to properly maintain and inspect firefighting equipment, provide unobstructed access to emergency exits, and insufficient lockout/tagout procedures for energy sources that could lead to amputations. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The eight repeat violations included failing to anchor a drill press, implement proper machine guarding, correct multiple electrical violations, and properly mount and maintain portable fire extinguishers. A violation is designated as a repeat violation when OSHA has previously notified an employer of the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any of its facilities within the last five years. OSHA inspected 25 Bureau of Reclamation facilities nationwide over the past five years, including a previous investigation at the Hoover Dam in October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bureau of Reclamation has 15 business days from receipt of the notices to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or appeal the notices by submitting a summary of its position on the unresolved issues to OSHA&amp;#39;s regional administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New York Frozen-Food Plant Cited for Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently cited Rosina Food Products Inc. with nine serious violations of workplace safety standards at its production facility in West Seneca, N.Y. The manufacturer of frozen-food products faces a proposed penalty of $54,750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inspection, which began in September, identified several deficiencies in the plant&amp;#39;s process safety management program, a detailed set of requirements and procedures employers must follow to proactively address hazards associated with processes and equipment involving large amounts of hazardous chemicals. In this case, the process was the operation and maintenance of the plant&amp;rsquo;s refrigeration system. The chemical was anhydrous ammonia, which is used in the refrigeration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The stringent and comprehensive requirements of OSHA&amp;#39;s process safety management standard are designed to prevent catastrophic incidents, such as the uncontrolled release of highly hazardous chemicals, including ammonia,&amp;quot; said Arthur Dube, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director for western New York. &amp;quot;This requires full, effective and proactive adherence to the standard&amp;#39;s requirements by the employer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s Buffalo-area office discovered that the plant lacked effective standard operating procedures for all emergency shutdown procedures of the refrigeration system, necessary corrective actions identified during hazard analyses of the refrigeration process, clear instructions for safely conducting refrigeration procedures, written procedures to maintain the ongoing mechanical integrity of all equipment used in the refrigeration process and procedures for handling small releases of anhydrous ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the inspection found that all required safety testing was not performed. The plant also had not developed or inspected specific procedures for locking out machines to prevent their unintended startup during servicing and had not used group lockout/tagout procedures as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings to the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

            <title>Increase Performance with an Engaged, Healthy Workforce</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/1/3/cf6a2d80-bd72-4a2f-b7ea-a8a881ac8623_new year.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;As you begin a new year in your organization, you must commit resources to answer the latest challenges and bring success to the bottom line. One of the main concerns in many companies is employee well-being and health. Indeed, to meet all of the challenges you face this year, you will need to ensure that your workforce is engaged and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many people, the resolution of daily exercise is made each year only to dwindle and flame out over the coming days, weeks or, in a few fortunate cases, months. Some folks actually do make it a lifelong way of life, and I applaud those who do. However, the vast majority of people typically fall back into their old routines without making any real changes to improve their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within an organizational setting, ergonomics and stretching can be key elements in achieving success in this area. I would be interested in knowing how many people have formal before-work and during-work stretching regimens in place to engage their workforce and potentially provide a method to improve the health and well-being of their employees. Of course, you can place programs, documents, checks and measurement systems in the environment, but without an engaged and healthy workforce, you are still lacking the essential element for any change program&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would also be interested in the cultural changes that have taken place as organizations instituted these types of programs as part of the standard work process of each day. In previous environments, I have seen where the day begins with music playing across the organization and people rising to their feet in their workgroups, moving to a series of well-designed stretches. Once completed, the group comes together for the five-minute pre-production review and then goes to the line to start the day. Have you been involved in a program like this? If you have made the transition to this sort of cultural change, how was it accepted? Do you still have it in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I firmly believe that people come to work each day looking for something to awaken their senses and bring joy to their time. This may be just the thing to improve recordable case-rate injuries from sprains and strains suffered at work. It definitely is a plan to consider for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/PpihyqBcjDA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Georgia Chemical Manufacturer Cited for Safety Violations after Explosion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MFG Chemical Inc. of Dalton, Ga., has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 20 safety violations following a plant explosion that resulted in the hospitalization of approximately 40 employees of other companies who were working in the surrounding area. Proposed penalties total $77,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The May explosion was caused by a runaway reaction from an overheated reactor. During the production of coagulant 129, a compound used in water treatment, an increase in temperature caused the reactor to overpressurize, rupturing the dome cover and blowing a hole in the roof of the facility. In response to the incident, OSHA conducted an inspection under the agency&amp;#39;s national emphasis program on process safety management for covered chemical facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nineteen serious violations involved exposing workers to fire and explosion hazards while they performed manufacturing duties, as well as failing to ensure that initial process hazard analyses were conducted. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The citations carry $76,300 in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One other-than-serious violation was related to failing to ensure that a material safety data worksheet contained the required information. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm. The citation carries a $700 penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This inspection has identified a wide range of safety hazards that need to be addressed in order to protect workers,&amp;quot; said Andre Richards, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Atlanta-West area office. &amp;quot;It is the employer&amp;#39;s responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MFG Chemical manufactures a range of specialty chemicals for the water treatment, agriculture, pulp and paper industries. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA cites Dover Chemical Plant for 47 Health, Safety Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Dover Chemical Co. for 47 health and safety violations, including four willful violations, after an unexpected release of hazardous materials led to the temporary shutdown of the company&amp;#39;s Dover plant and an adjacent highway in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although no injuries were reported as a result of the incident, OSHA opened an investigation focused on the agency&amp;#39;s standards for process safety management (PSM) at facilities that use highly hazardous chemicals. Proposed fines total $545,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The release of materials resulted from a breach of a polyvinyl-chloride piping system. Due to the nature of the hazards and the willful violations cited, Dover Chemical has been placed in OSHA&amp;#39;s Severe Violator Enforcement Program, which mandates targeted follow-up inspections to ensure compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By disregarding OSHA&amp;#39;s common-sense regulations, this employer endangered the health and safety of the facility&amp;#39;s workers,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;quot;While I&amp;#39;m grateful that nobody was injured from the incident, I&amp;#39;m alarmed by the egregious nature of the violations we uncovered during our inspection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The willful violations all related to PSM and included failing to correct deficiencies found in compliance audits, not resolving recommendations identified during a process hazard analysis, having operating procedures that do not include the consequences for deviation or the steps required to correct or avoid deviation from operating limits, and process safety information that does not detail the construction materials used for piping and piping system components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Dover facility employs about 175 workers and produces chlorinated paraffins, additives for flame-resistant products, and other additives for the plastic, rubber coating, adhesive and textile product industries. The facility has been inspected by OSHA four other times since 2007, resulting in earlier citations for four violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>7 Ways to Achieve a Culture of Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do safety leaders and managers create a culture of safety? Knowing that safety is important is clearly not enough. Slogans like &amp;quot;Safety First&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Target Zero&amp;quot; may be powerful and eloquent, but they typically don&amp;rsquo;t produce the buy-in that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The only way to change a culture is to get an extremely high level of repeatable buy-in. That means the message from leadership has to be very clear and simple to implement. It also means you have to be realistic about what&amp;rsquo;s working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have you noticed that the job site with the best safety record is the one where the boss makes everyone feel valuable, the people seem to trust one another and everyone gets along well? While there may be a few exceptions, most research confirms that people make fewer mistakes when they feel valuable. They are more loyal and watch out for each other. They are consistently willing to do more of what they are asked to do. All of this results in dramatically fewer incidents and a true culture of safety. But how do you make that happen in your organization or at your location? Here are seven ways to achieve a culture of safety and reduce incidents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Beware of mixed messages. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, you guys, be safe, but hurry up! Don&amp;#39;t be so safe that we can&amp;#39;t make any money!&amp;quot; The real message is: &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s get it done before 5 p.m., but if you get outside the safety guidelines, rethink it.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Make sure that the people around you understand that you have their back. &lt;/strong&gt;They will be more likely to have yours. Watch your behavior and treat others with respect. Guess who will not have anyone rushing back into the burning building to save him? That&amp;#39;s right, the guy who nobody likes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Be realistic about how people feel about safety procedures. &lt;/strong&gt;If you have a process or situation that everyone makes fun of or complains about, look into it and make adjustments. There is nothing more dangerous than expecting people to be protected by things they obviously don&amp;rsquo;t believe in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Remember that many accidents happen indoors in office environments. &lt;/strong&gt;Approximately 76,000 people each year are hospitalized from putting their feet on their desks and leaning back in a chair. Acting like a big shot is not only obnoxious, but apparently it&amp;#39;s also dangerous. In addition, women in high heels who stepped from carpeted surfaces to hard floors had a surprising number of injuries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Communication skills are the foundation of safety. &lt;/strong&gt;Let people talk about what&amp;rsquo;s important to them before you tell them your opinions. People who feel heard are much more likely to listen to you. To make safety happen, you have to be influential enough so that what you say creates actions in others. If people see their input in your safety solution, they are much more likely to have buy-in and much less likely to be injured.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t tell the guys in their 20s how brave you were &amp;ldquo;back in the day&amp;rdquo; before modern safety equipment. &lt;/strong&gt;You are your brothers&amp;#39; and sisters&amp;#39; keepers, and that especially means your younger brothers and sisters. On a job site, I once heard a guy in his 50s say to a group of people in their 20s, &amp;quot;You young guys have all this protective clothing and special tools. In the &amp;#39;70s, we were down in there naked with a Q-tip.&amp;quot; Challenging someone&amp;#39;s manhood makes you part of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Be able to clearly explain the value of a safety procedure or policy in 30 seconds. &lt;/strong&gt;People buy into what they understand quickly. The leading addiction on the planet is not drugs or alcohol but convenience. People will consistently abandon a safe process that&amp;#39;s complicated for an unsafe one that&amp;rsquo;s not. Keep it simple. It does not matter how smart you are if nobody knows what you&amp;#39;re talking about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you are a leader who is driving safety forward or just a person on the job trying to be good at what you do without being hurt, influence is required. Are you influential enough to make safety happen around you? Do you have the trust and the relationships in place to help safety concepts and procedures remain effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For some, it may be hard to buy into how important it is for people to have a supportive environment to do their job. You may think that people should just do what they are supposed to do and be safe, but in reality the overwhelming success of this approach is kind of like listening to NASCAR on the radio; You personally may not believe it makes any sense, but for some strange reason it&amp;rsquo;s still happening.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA Cites Pennsylvania Recycler for Health, Safety Hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Donald R. Klein and Vortex Recycling Inc. for 27 violations of safety and health standards. OSHA initiated an inspection of the&amp;nbsp;company&amp;rsquo;s New Castle facility in response to a complaint. Proposed penalties total $58,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The one repeat violation involved failing to remove defective or unsafe powered industrial trucks from service. The citation carries a $5,600 fine. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. A similar violation was cited in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 25 serious violations included a variety of fall, electrical and struck-by hazards; using equipment that was improperly installed, identified and located; improperly maintaining emergency eyewash stations, shower facilities and portable fire extinguishers;&amp;nbsp;having unguarded machinery; crane deficiencies; a lack of proper housekeeping procedures for areas around plant equipment; and failing to develop programs for energy control, hearing conservation, permit-required confined spaces and hazard communication. The citations carry $51,700 in penalties. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The one other-than-serious violation concerned having unsanitary eating areas. The citation carries a $700 penalty. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These violations pose serious risks to Vortex Recycling workers and must be addressed immediately,&amp;quot; said Theresa A. Naim, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Erie area office. &amp;quot;Employers are responsible for ensuring safe and healthful workplaces, and will be held legally accountable when they fail to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The oil filter recycler employs 20 workers at its New Castle facility and has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Accenture Life Safety Solution Named New Product of the Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Accenture Life Safety Solution recently received the industrial hygiene product of the year award from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Occupational Health &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;magazine. Developed by Accenture, Industrial Scientific, Cisco and AeroScout, the wireless-enabled multi-gas detection system helps companies to remotely monitor incidents and to locate workers in hazardous locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is designed for environments such as oil and gas refineries, chemical and manufacturing plants, utilities, mines and other locations where dense steel infrastructure can make wireless safety solutions difficult to implement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Worker safety is a key priority for a range of industries with operations in challenging working locations,&amp;quot; said Massimo Pagella of Accenture Plant and Automation Solutions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;This solution can help mitigate risks by continuously monitoring the environment in the plant and automatically providing feedback on abnormalities to the control centers and to management.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Accenture Life Safety Solution uses multiple Wi-Fi access points to determine the location of workers. The solution, which is designed, installed and deployed specific to a location, uses a lapel-based wireless four-gas detector as well as a panic button and a motion sensor to detect when a worker stops moving for a period of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Accenture Life Safety Solution has brought to market a revolutionary approach to gas monitoring that is capable of overseeing the safety of thousands of employees working across a large plant in real time and from a central location,&amp;quot; said Raghu Arunachalam, director of emerging technologies at Industrial Scientific. &amp;quot;We are honored to have this unique, life-saving solution recognized as a new product of the year by &lt;em&gt;Occupational Health &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Occupational Health &amp;amp; Safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;award program honors the outstanding product development achievements of companies that create products considered particularly noteworthy in their ability to improve workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honeywell Introduces New Safety Products</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honeywell recently unveiled several new safety products to help minimize injuries and maintain a more protective and productive workplace. The products were introduced at the opening of the 2012 National Safety Council (NSC) Congress and Expo in Orlando, Fla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the new products announced were the full-body AirCore harness, Miller&amp;#39;s Fall Clearance Calculator, the MightyLite Leading Edge Self-Retracting Lifeline, the Uvex Carbonvision wide-view safety goggle, Oliver work boots, North&amp;#39;s lower-profile respiratory cartridges and cartridge/filter combinations, and the QUIETPRO QP100Ex intelligent communication and hearing protection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also launched the Eyelation program, which allows end users to select and order prescription safety eyewear 24 hours a day, and the &amp;quot;Lead Them to Safety&amp;quot; initiative, which provides managers with a wide range of safety-focused best practices, tools, resources, advice and research drawn from expert sources around the world. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A culture of safety exists when safety managers inspire workers to change their behaviors and make safe choices on their own for their own protection as well as that of their friends and co-workers,&amp;quot; said John Montigny, chief marketing officer for Honeywell Safety Products.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Holcim Facility Reaches Safety Milestone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim (US) Inc. recently announced that its Devil&amp;rsquo;s Slide facility in Morgan, Utah, has surpassed the eight-year mark without a lost-time injury (LTI), which is defined as an injury that requires an employee to take time off for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>OSHA Cites Delaware Manufacturer for Safety, Health Violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Formosa Plastics Corp. with 16 alleged safety and health violations at its site in Delaware City, Del. Proposed penalties total $148,700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two repeat violations, with $66,000 in penalties, involve a failure to perform process equipment inspections and tests, inspect critical valves, and ensure that PVC dust did not accumulate on surfaces and the floor of a bagging area. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The same violation was cited following a separate investigation in March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fourteen serious violations include electrical hazards, a deficient process safety management program, incomplete emergency shutdown procedures, no machine guarding,&amp;nbsp;a lack of training&amp;nbsp;for workers participating in emergency response and failing to periodically evaluate contractor performance. A serious violation occurs when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known. The citations carry $82,700 in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This employer continues to disregard OSHA&amp;#39;s process safety management standards and put its workers at risk of injury and possible death,&amp;quot; said Domenick Salvatore, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Wilmington Area Office. &amp;quot;Employers are responsible for ensuring safe and healthful workplaces, and will be held legally accountable when they fail to do so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Livingston, N.J., Formosa Plastics employs 107 workers at its Delaware City site. The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA area director or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lattimore Reaches Safety Milestone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Aggregate Industries US recently announced that Lattimore Materials Corp. (LMC) has surpassed the 2-million-hour mark without a lost-time injury, which is defined as an injury that requires an employee to take time off for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A provider of ready-mix concrete and aggregate products to building trades in north Texas, LMC operates&amp;nbsp;seven aggregate mines,&amp;nbsp;26 ready-mix sites with 35 concrete plants,&amp;nbsp;four rail terminals and a fleet of more than 400 mixer and haul trucks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We commend Lattimore for its accomplishment and unwavering attention to safety,&amp;quot; said Bernard Terver, president and chief executive officer of Aggregate Industries US, a Holcim Group Company. &amp;quot;Our employees have shown great commitment to implementing our universal safety measures. We&amp;#39;re proud of their accomplishments and look forward to continued excellence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As industry leaders in safety standards, Aggregate Industries US and Holcim US have also celebrated numerous lost-time injury milestones in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Inherently Safer: The Future of Risk Reduction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	An explosion at the Bayer Crop Science plant in Institute, W.Va., which killed two workers and injured eight others in 2008, raised the question of whether there was a safer alternative for storing and using highly toxic chemicals. This U.S. Chemical Safety Board video illustrates how industries can benefit from incorporating the principles of inherently safer design into making decisions while preventing accidents and reducing the consequences of accidents should one occur. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Reliability is a Green Initiative</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Demand for products has declined in many parts of the world, and with more manufacturing being shipped overseas, reliability of our existing processes is even more important than before. Many of my friends in different industries have told me about all of the initiatives being done to &amp;ldquo;green up&amp;rdquo; their facilities and processes. Going green and being environmentally responsible is a great thing, and I think we should be pushing to move more in that direction. With that said, the interesting thing that I have been hearing is that reliability is getting lost in the green push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think reliability is the first green initiative we should invest in. Some people will argue that reliability is not a green initiative, but I assure you that it is. It&amp;rsquo;s no mystery that part of being green is doing more with less. Improved reliability will mean a decrease in demand of raw materials and storage space for those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A benefit in decreased use of raw materials means longer-term sustainability of the raw materials. This will also make it easier to project needs of materials because the process will be more stable and predictable. The decreased amount of raw materials may increase the cost per unit, but it usually will be far offset by the second part of reliability being a green initiative, which is a decrease in waste materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The decrease in waste materials will have a huge impact on cost and safety. Not only does the decrease in waste materials mean a reduction in disposal but also decreased cost in storage of the waste materials. In addition, the decreased amount of especially hazardous waste reduces the risk of environmental or safety incidents occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not in any way saying that we need to set the green initiatives aside. What I am saying is that reliability should take the front seat and not get put behind green. Reliability is a green initiative in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/Nt0heiNV3_M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Aggregate Industries Earns Safety Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Several locations of Aggregate Industries US Midwest Region (AIMWR) have been recognized by the Safety Awards Program of the Illinois Association for Aggregate Producers (IAAP). The awards were presented during IAAP&amp;rsquo;s annual convention on May 15, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The IAAP Rock Solid Safety in Excellence Award, the highest award level, went to 11 locations: Portable AC2, Portable AC3, Portable NB1, Algonquin Pit 5, Battle Creek Plant, Chelsea Plant, Dyer Lake Pit 34, Edwardsburg/Milliken Plant, Otsego Shop, Pullman/Sweet Plant and Wayland Plant. Two more locations, Dundee Quarry and McHenry West Pit 26, received the IAAP Silver Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are extremely honored to have been presented with these awards,&amp;rdquo; said Bernard Terver, president and chief executive officer of Aggregate Industries US. &amp;ldquo;Aggregate Industries US constantly strives to improve our safety training and safety management systems. This recognition is a testament to the commitment to safety of every Aggregate Industries US employee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The IAAP Safety Committee&amp;rsquo;s Rock Solid Safety Award Program publicly recognizes members who set high safety and health standards in the conduct of their operations. This form of recognition serves to reward companies that implement sound safety and health programs while encouraging other mine operators and service providers to use recognized systems and methods to prevent injuries or illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A&amp;nbsp;Holcim Group company, Aggregate Industries US is a provider of aggregate and construction materials to markets in 16 states and 300 cities.

            <title>Goodyear to Receive Award for Zero Waste to Landfill Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Goodyear Tire &amp;amp; Rubber Company will receive a 2012 Manny Award in the &amp;quot;Green Initiative&amp;quot; category from &lt;em&gt;Inside Business&lt;/em&gt; magazine. The award is in recognition of Goodyear&amp;#39;s zero waste to landfill program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Goodyear will receive the award at a banquet in Cleveland on May 17 and will be featured in the May/June issue of &lt;em&gt;Inside Business&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2008, Goodyear has not sent any manufacturing waste from its 53 factories to landfills anywhere in the world. The initiative was started in 2006 to reduce Goodyear&amp;#39;s environmental impact by requiring all plants to reduce, reuse and recycle manufacturing waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Goodyear believes our zero waste to landfill initiative represents a responsible next step in environmental stewardship, both through the effective management of byproducts and also the elimination of materials going into landfills,&amp;quot; said Dave Chapman, Goodyear&amp;#39;s director of environmental, health and safety sustainability. &amp;quot;As part of our corporate mission, we strive to take care of our environment and communities, and achieving zero waste to landfill is a win for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the 2012 Manny Award for zero waste to landfill, Goodyear received a 2011 Manny Award in the &amp;ldquo;Employee Safety&amp;rdquo; category for its &amp;ldquo;No One Gets Hurt&amp;rdquo; internal safety strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past 15 years, the Manny Awards have recognized Northeast Ohio manufacturers&amp;#39; greatest accomplishments, innovation and best practices. Since 1998, the Manny Awards program has recognized more than 100 manufacturers that have excelled in such areas as product development, green initiatives and workplace environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the world&amp;#39;s largest tire companies, Goodyear employs approximately 73,000 people and manufactures its products in 53 facilities in 22 countries around the world.

            <title>How a Visual Workplace Improves Safety </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/11/162a2e8b-3a4e-4bcb-89e3-3eb799dd3437_SafetyPoster-2.jpeg " style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 379px; float: left;" /&gt;What does a visual workplace have to do with your safety program? Well, it can be one of your best tools for promoting and maintaining awareness among your employees as well as a subtle training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human beings are visual creatures. We are geared to perceive our environment through our primary sense: vision. You see, interpret and catalog enormous amounts of data through your sense of sight every day. A great deal of this is subconscious, but very real. Why not piggy-back onto this completely natural process to teach safety principles, transfer information on safety resources and keep safety in your employees&amp;rsquo; daily thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK, you ask, &amp;ldquo;How do I do that with visual aids?&amp;rdquo; It seems fairly intuitive to me that you think about what you see, so let&amp;rsquo;s put things into the visual field that promote our safety goals &amp;mdash; things like safety slogans, how-to posters, signs that point out hazards or direct you to safety equipment, and informational posters that increase the employees&amp;rsquo; knowledge base. Placement is important. It helps to rotate posters so you get more bang for your effort and people don&amp;rsquo;t get jaded by seeing the same old remark in the same place every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Safety Slogans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I like the idea of having a number of these that fit into 8.5-by-11-inch holders on the wall. Rotate the posters every so often between the locations to keep the message fresh. Locations should be where people congregate or pass the most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	How-to Posters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lifting techniques, fire extinguisher procedures, CPR instructions, etc., all pass on information that can come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Hazard Signs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can get the pre-made stickers showing pinch points, fire hazards, electrical shock hazards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Personal Protective Equipment Signs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that you can post the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the area, and you can also put up posters that show the proper use of that PPE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Informational Posters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lots of things are available that explain material safety data sheets (MSDS). There are also signs that show where to find safety equipment like fire extinguishers and spill response kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To get these aids, search the Internet and look under &amp;ldquo;safety posters.&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;ll find hundreds of sources with many products available for reasonable prices. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to break the bank up front to get some results. Start where it makes sense to you and expand along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s important that you have someone in management that supports and promotes your awareness effort in meetings, in daily discussions and even in e-mails or letters. A simple safety comment at the end or somewhere within the subject makes everyone aware that safety is a priority with management. Every meeting, no matter how small or large, should include safety in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How does this affect the bottom line? Safety pays for itself in reduced insurance rates, in fewer lost work days, and in increased production and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduced Insurance Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The average back injury in industry can run about $80,000. That&amp;rsquo;s not chump-change. Your insurance carrier quotes your rates based on your injury history and the risks inherent in your industry. The risks can be pretty much built into the process without some major re-engineering, but your injury history can be changed. Reduce the opportunities for injury and you reduce the incidence of injury. Once you start reducing those incidences through better knowledge and better methods, you can talk to your carrier about reduced rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fewer Lost Work Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This seems self-evident. If you reduce your opportunities for injury and you reduce the severity of those injuries, you reduce the days that must be lost. It can be something as simple as fewer days lost to slips, trips and falls or as complicated as fewer days lost because your folks knew the hazards associated with a chemical and avoided exposure. Fewer lost days mean better use of available labor, and that can mean less overtime hours or even reduce the need to hire additional people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Increased Production&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;A safe shop is a more productive shop. That sounds like an unsubstantiated clich&amp;eacute;, but I have found it to be true. When you approach a job on the safety side, you get an added benefit of better planning for that job. Many times, we find that formatting the job to be safer also makes it more efficient as we do a better job of placing materials, supplying the correct tools and making the work easier for the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A safe approach to a task can improve the quality of the result, and that means repairs are performed better, inspections are completed more thoroughly, and equipment operates longer between failures. Technicians that have the proper safety knowledge and equipment, lift properly, have better access to components and tools, and use the proper PPE also do a better job of torquing bolts, leveling or aligning components, and are also more apt to perform a thorough inspection. Safety habits promote a planned approach to the job, and that gets the job done better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are lots of little tricks to promote safety, but the most important one is to just get started. Do a little research on the Internet, contact some vendors, ask around among the folks in your professional organizations or industry contacts, and talk to your troops. Do a walk-about at your plant or shop, make a mental inventory of what can be done and then do something. Start small in one area or with one approach and then expand as you go. Safety and reliability are journeys with no end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/V_TI74szj1c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability Begins with the Essentials </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s a really great documentary that shows up periodically on public television. It describes the building of the Boulder (Hoover) Dam on the Colorado River back in the early 1930s. (Like many, I was never really sure if these were two separate dams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was a project of truly incredible size at the time, one that needed and brought out some really innovative engineering, construction and logistical processes. However, there were some negatives brought out in the documentary. One of them being that if OSHA had been in existence at the time and visited the site, the project would have been shut down pretty much immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the work was incredibly dangerous. A premier high-paying job, for example, was lowering yourself by rope down the sheer 700-foot canyon wall, where the concrete would eventually bond to the rock, knocking free any loose rock that would affect the concrete bond (and, of course, avoiding loose rocks knocked free by your co-workers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(Contrary to the legend, though, no one actually ever fell into the concrete and was buried because the concrete pour couldn&amp;rsquo;t be stopped. This would have caused a serious flaw in the concrete, and quality of the concrete was a paramount focus of everyone working on it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/27/00de4234-a86e-46dd-aeb5-fc5a77547c3d_hooverdam.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;This sort of leads to the implication that in today&amp;rsquo;s world &amp;mdash; with the concerns and regulations about safety, environmental, fair hiring practices, etc. &amp;mdash; that a project like the Boulder Dam just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done at anything approaching a reasonable cost. The reality, though, is that in today&amp;rsquo;s world, this same project would be done faster, safer, better and cheaper (even in today&amp;rsquo;s dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similar thought about manufacturing. We all sort of know and feel that if we could just focus on producing units, cases, tons, whatever, and not worry about quality, housekeeping, paperwork and all that other &amp;ldquo;stuff,&amp;rdquo; just &amp;ldquo;get the job done,&amp;rdquo; we would get a whole lot more produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reality is the opposite, and we&amp;rsquo;ve all proved it to ourselves time after time. It seems as if it&amp;rsquo;s one of these lessons that we all just have a tough time learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We&amp;rsquo;ve convinced ourselves that we are just too busy or under too much pressure to take the time or apply the resources to maintenance, housekeeping, safety, quality, record-keeping, training, etc. Every single time, that decision has eventually come back to bite us much harder and more painfully than doing it right to begin with would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We feel we can make choices about these essentials, treating them as opportunities, and thinking we can apply some cost-benefit analysis to determine if they are worth doing. We forget that they are essentials and not choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	None of this is easy, as we all know. It takes creativity and effort to generate and explore options. But if there is no continued commitment to the essentials, and easy, quick, obvious, common-sense, business decisions are made to skip them, we will pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	None of this implies that we always accept and don&amp;rsquo;t push back and question the other &amp;ldquo;stuff.&amp;rdquo; We also have to find creative ways to get maintenance, housekeeping, training, record-keeping, etc., done in the quickest, cheapest, most effective way. One of the really great things about the North American worker is that he or she will always test the limits. Some will argue to the death; others won&amp;rsquo;t argue but just won&amp;rsquo;t do whatever it is unless they are convinced it has value. The most productive, efficient plants are always the cleanest and safest and produce the highest-quality product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We see this often with equipment. If a machine is ignored and allowed to become dirty, loose, misaligned and unlubricated, it begins to behave in an uncooperative, unpredictable, undependable, attention-demanding way (just like people do), requiring more and more of the attention of its operators. This prevents them from doing many other things and also forces them into more and more contact with the machine, raising the probability of more safety issues. Consistent product quality also becomes more of a struggle with an inconsistent machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If, on the other hand, a machine is treated well and kept clean, aligned, tight and lubricated, its behavior changes amazingly. It becomes dependable, predictable, reliable and capable of performing well without constant attention (again like people do), freeing up its operators for other improving activities that will increase productivity even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Holcim Plants Receive Safety, Environmental Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim Inc. recently announced that its plants in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Holly Hill, S.C.,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Theodore, Ala.&lt;/span&gt;, were recognized for their safety and environmental performance during the Portland Cement Association&amp;#39;s (PCA) spring board of directors&amp;rsquo; meeting in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Chicago&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Holly Hill&lt;/span&gt; plant received the Chairman&amp;#39;s Safety Performance Award in recognition of its exceptional health and safety programs, while the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Theodore&lt;/span&gt; plant earned the Environmental Performance Award for steps taken beyond those required by laws, regulations and permits to minimize their impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Safety and the environment are of utmost importance to Holcim,&amp;quot; said Bernard Terver, president and chief executive officer of Holcim. &amp;quot;This recognition is a reflection of our employees&amp;#39; commitment to making sure that each of our employees and visitors to our facilities go home safely at the end of the day, and of their commitment to protecting the environment. They have worked hard to produce these results and are deserving of these awards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim is one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading manufacturers and suppliers of cement and mineral components with approximately 1,800 employees, 12 manufacturing plants and more than 50 distribution facilities in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt;.

            <title>How Ladders Enhance Safety, Reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/16/3e4bfc61-f7b8-4753-885c-da10b090e2f3_ladder.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Everyone can remember a time when they needed a stepladder to get nameplate data, but with none around, climbed on top of something nearby instead. As we become more aware of safety in all of our daily activities, this behavior raises a red flag. The opportunity for a slip and fall injury here is too high to ignore, and yet human nature says it will happen too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you consider the initial costs against the potential benefits, having enough ladders staged at handy intervals in your plant is a good return on maintenance dollars. You leverage those dollars by getting multiple advantages from the ladders, such as increased safety, better labor utilization and improved work quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety improves when technicians use the ladders instead of climbing on motors, oily gearboxes, handrails and unstable items to reach things. Even a short fall can break an arm, hurt a back or create a head injury. With the average lost-time accident running into the thousands of dollars, a few ladders can seem very cheap in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labor utilization improves when you aren&amp;rsquo;t using highly trained technicians to carry ladders around your plant. It also means that those same techs will take the time to tighten that dripping packing, change the flickering light bulb or replace that electrical cover rather than pass it by. The increased reliability frees up that labor to do more cost-effective activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work quality improves because your technicians can comfortably reach the job on a stable platform and take those few extra minutes that torques the flange properly, tightens the fitting that was leaking and replaces the cover that protects your expensive instrument from moisture. Improved work quality means more reliable repairs, fewer mistakes and fewer come-backs &amp;mdash; all of which cost money and use your scarce labor resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have trouble with ladders growing feet and leaving in the backs of trucks, consider lockable brackets with a common keyed lock. Each technician gets a key, and management reinforces the behavior of returning the ladders to their brackets and locking them in place to be available for the next time. Start small in the areas where ladders are used the most often and then expand outward from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you buy enough ladders, you will probably want to get them manufactured with your company name stenciled within the fiberglass coating to improve your chances of keeping them. Also, be sure to buy the 300-pound capacity ladders instead of the cheaper 225-pound models. Americans are bigger now, and the guy who is 250 to 300 pounds is much more common than in the past. If ladders are stored outside, remember that UV light can damage fiberglass, so placement is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/d0jM0NWmyMA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Link between Reliability and Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last year or so, the question of reducing the cost of reliability has been ever present. Many maintenance budgets have been slashed without due process or reflecting on the true cost over time. I recently attended a conference where this was a topic of conversation. Out of all the discussions that I have heard, the most effective statement was to respond to that request from a CEO or plant manager with the following question: &amp;ldquo;How much are you willing to reduce the amount spent on safety?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, not everyone makes the tie that reliability and safety go hand in hand. I am reminded of a letter that Dave O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, the CEO of Chevron Corporation, sent to employees where he said, &amp;ldquo;Reliability, like safety, is a critical element of operational excellence and requires our constant attention.&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability drives safety and vice versa. Consider that most accidents don&amp;rsquo;t occur when things are running smoothly and the equipment has a high level of reliability. Accidents occur when we fall into reactive chaos. When a packaging machine is no longer operating in a reliable state, lots of minor stops may cause an operator to reach into a running machine (bypassing the safety procedures) and remove jammed cartons or film. The moment of frustration may cause the loss of a finger, hand or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less spending on maintenance may result in more leaking piping or vessels. The operator gives up on keeping the floor clean. Now, not only are the pipes leaking, but the main process line is acting up. When the product piles up on the end of a main conveyor due to a neglected bearing, the operator makes a mad dash to clear the pileup. On the way, he or she slips and falls in the area where the leak has created a puddle on the floor. The spiral only worsens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge that we face as maintenance and reliability professionals is to connect the dots for our leadership. We have to elevate maintenance and reliability as a profession and not have it viewed as &amp;ldquo;a necessary evil.&amp;rdquo; Sure, it is one of the most controllable costs in a site. When you toss out labor as a &amp;ldquo;sunk cost&amp;rdquo; (X number of people to produce X number of widgets), the largest (and easiest target) is the maintenance budget. Most every other cost requires capital to influence (energy costs, as an example) or is fixed via contract (logistics, raw materials, etc.) or global pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it is one of the most controllable costs, maintenance and reliability can be one of the greatest drivers of productivity and reduced costs. This is done not by slashing the budgets indiscriminately, but by keeping the focus on reliability as a long-term investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So when you are asked by the CEO or plant manager about reducing reliability costs, ask if that leader is willing to reduce the organization&amp;rsquo;s investment in safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/pzxjojfQwI0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Pfannenberg Introduces Industrial Flashing Sounders</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/10/2e37fcc8-cd3a-4675-b3ef-33f8a9e4992f_PA X 5_r_clear_g_amber.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 272px; float: left;" /&gt;Pfannenberg has introduced a new line of industrial flashing sounders. The new Patrol Series PA X 5 flashing sounders offer the ability to select from 80 unique tones, including continuous, sweeping, alternating, pulsing and interrupted tones, as well as simulated bells, sirens and whoops that meet international standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each unit is designed as an integrated flashing sounder rather than combining a sounder with a bolted-on flashing light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequency content of delivered tones has been engineered to provide more &amp;ldquo;punch-through&amp;rdquo; of obstacles such as walls and doors for a wider area of coverage. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The flashing strobe is available with either 5- or 10-joule flash energy to produce a level of alarming to suit the required area of visible coverage and hazard severity for the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Users can choose from a wide selection of acoustic tones that are electronically self-generated. Four tone stages are available at each setting. In addition, since there are no moving parts, the device&amp;rsquo;s reliability is enhanced for critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The housing is manufactured from a UV-resistant and flame-retardant polycarbonate/ABS blend and is offered in red, gray or white to meet application requirements and building decor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The large lens cover is highly visible and available in a variety of colors. The strobe flash tube contains no filament to break and is secured by a steel clamp to further protect it from abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each unit splits into two pieces for ease of installation. The base portion facilitates all wiring connections so installation is straightforward and requires only one person. Redundant contacts are provided for daisy-chaining of multiple units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The design team at Pfannenberg truly took a step back in order to evaluate the flashing sounder&amp;rsquo;s entire solution requirements from performance, handling and installation perspectives,&amp;rdquo; says product manager Ray Limburg. &amp;ldquo;The result is an elegantly engineered product that delivers multiple advantages, which system integrators, facilities engineers, machinery safety engineers and installation electricians will benefit from.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Roanoke Cement Receives Safety, Environmental Awards </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Roanoke Cement Company recently announced that its &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville, Va.,&lt;/span&gt; plant and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Castle Hayne, N.C.,&lt;/span&gt; terminal will be honored later this month for excellence in two different areas: environmental outreach and terminal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville&lt;/span&gt; plant is the winner of the Outreach Award for the 2012 Cement Industry Energy and Environmental Awards. Sponsored by the Portland Cement Association and &lt;i&gt;Cement Americas&lt;/i&gt; magazine, the awards are presented to individual cement facilities that exemplify the spirit of continuous environmental improvement and support this commitment with action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The outreach category credits activities that enhance community, employee and government relations. Included among the achievements and initiatives noted for the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville&lt;/span&gt; plant were a fifth consecutive Energy Star award, the 2011 Virginia Statewide Mineral Mining Reclamation Award, the on-site mitigation plan and quarry expansion, participation in Habitat for Humanity and the American Cancer Society&amp;#39;s Relay for Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We manufacture an important building material and at the same time are dedicated stewards of our environment,&amp;quot; says &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Lance Clark&lt;/span&gt;, environmental manager. &amp;quot;After all, we work and live here, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second award will be given to the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Castle Hayne, N.C.,&lt;/span&gt; terminal for its exemplary safety record. The terminal has not had a lost-time accident in 15 years and was honored last fall by North Carolina Department of Labor Commissioner &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Cherie Berry&lt;/span&gt;, who presented the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot; to the terminal for ongoing, effective workplace safety and health management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both awards will be presented at the Portland Cement Association&amp;#39;s board meeting on &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;April 16, 2012,&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Chicago&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Signage and Labeling can Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of signage and labeling is often underplayed or even ignored when a maintenance program is being discussed. Since we are visual creatures and the visual workplace is the direct application of this, we should take a few minutes to go over some reasons and applications for signage and labeling to get more attention in our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Signage can be for several reasons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regulatory compliance (e.g., personal protective equipment, arc flash, Department of Transportation placarding)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Access control, such as &amp;ldquo;Authorized Personnel Only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fire safety, such as extinguisher locations and fire exits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General safety (e.g., cautions about fork truck traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Behavior and training purposes (safety reminders and CPR how-to directions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labeling is usually more specific but is also varied in use. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Piping labels per ANSI standard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment labeling for the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storage location labels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Special tools and tooling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safety equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment set points and wear indicators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these and more play an important part in achieving your maintenance and reliability goals. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that one of the biggest factors in your success is your ability to communicate effectively with your operators and technicians. They need clear direction on proper behavior and actions. A few generic, half-hearted exhortations to &amp;ldquo;work smarter&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;work safely&amp;rdquo; look nice on the wall, but do they truly achieve their intent if they are not coupled with specific instructions? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It takes visible, useful and targeted information to let your people know what you expect from them. In exchange, you have to provide them the tools they need to make it happen. Proper signage and labeling moves your organization in the right direction and does so at a very reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a look around your maintenance shop first and look for the simple things like the safety posters, the grinder guard safety labels, the special tools storage labels, the fire equipment, oily rag storage, etc., that you could do right away. Then, expand out into areas that are under your control and start putting up the signs and labels that you can see are missing. Go to the various safety sites on the Internet and check your general vendors for what they offer for ideas. I guarantee that you will see opportunities for everything from flammable materials storage to pinch points, arc flash and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your piping labels are especially important if your process includes hazardous materials or high pressures and temperatures. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the directional arrows for clarity where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment labels pay off big time for your CMMS system and for improving the accuracy of your work orders, as well as assisting your safety program. Putting the identification number or code, a proper description and the power shut-off locations on the tag are the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ID number gets the work orders written to the right spot and ties together bills of material, standard operating procedures and lockout/tagout procedures as well as just about anything else your imagination can connect to that unique piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proper description gets everyone using the same name for it, and that reduces confusion. Everyone has run into the problem of the new guy who calls it a widget when you call it a whatsit. Save time all around and get everyone on the same page with a simple tag or label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Power source locations are a big safety item that could help to save an injury or equipment damage by directing people to the shut-off right away. Don&amp;rsquo;t pass up this opportunity to save time in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your operations partners will recognize the value quickly. Jobs are recorded more accurately, take less time and get done safer. Who could argue with that? They will want to get on the train with you and share in the good results. Plus, it is fairly cheap, can be done with in-house labor and can be spread out over months or even over multiple budget years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/YBG1BQgEFRc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Georgia-Pacific Professional will again honor the champions of America&amp;rsquo;s workforce with its Brawny Industrial Brand Great American Worker contest. The company is seeking individuals who combine a history of workplace safety and high work productivity with a commitment to community involvement for the chance to win a Ford F-150 truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;As part of our commitment to excellence, we are excited to give workers across the country an opportunity to be recognized for their achievements both in their workplace and in their community,&amp;rdquo; said Bill Tracey, Georgia-Pacific Professional vice president. &amp;ldquo;Georgia-Pacific Professional is proud to support the tireless workers who go above and beyond their duties every day. We look forward to another year of celebrating America&amp;rsquo;s unsung heroes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now in its second year, the contest has added new elements for 2012. Potential Great American Workers have the opportunity to nominate themselves and ask their supporters and communities to vote for them. Nominations will be accepted until July 8, 2012, and can be submitted online. Those who wish to nominate themselves will be required to compose a short essay describing how they demonstrate the qualities and characteristics of a Great American Worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the submission period has ended, 10 finalists will be selected, and the public will vote for the 2012 Great American Worker. During the public voting period, submissions will be entered into a sweepstakes.

            <title>What You Should Do Before a Plant Closure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s happened &amp;hellip; the announcement that a major portion of your facility is being closed for the foreseeable future. What do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accept the news that your plant is facing an impending plant shutdown. It is not necessarily a &amp;ldquo;knockout&amp;rdquo; for the plant or your career. Remember, in the often uneven battleground called the global marketplace, just about anything can happen. Be ready to get up and start fighting again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Designate responsibility to an individual for writing a list of possible scenarios. The individual should have enough clout to implement the chosen strategy, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Go to the top of the company and request that sufficient funds be made available to execute the initial shutdown and preservation strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Choose the right type of long-term equipment caretakers. Those selected are often security or ex-supervisory types rather than experienced operator/craftsmen with intimate knowledge of the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;rsquo;t allow critical components to be pirated (stolen for use elsewhere) if part of a larger plant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove all process materials. Even innocuous materials left in the unit in the long term will likely cost five times more than at the initial shutdown. The current operations people are familiar with all the hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Seek expert advice on equipment preservation resulting in not getting the best bang for the buck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve the hourly workforce in the shutdown and mothball plan. Almost unbelievably, our recent experience has been that if the decision to shut down at some future date has been made, then involving operators and mechanics can very much improve both the quality of the shutdown plan and its execution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Not only record but clearly and physically mark what has been done to preserve the item of equipment during deactivation. The reactivating crew (probably a different group of people) can easily miss that a filter, line blind, internal component, etc., has been removed or added with serious consequences at a future start-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our experience, idle plants with small crews operating at a very relaxed tempo can be dangerous places. Make sure safety programs and routine audits are kept active to avoid accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as with any critical situation, a long-term strategic approach coupled with a series of medium-term tactics and detailed plans are needed. You should also consider how long the shutdown is probably going to last (guesstimate) and whether the plant will most likely be restarted, sold as a complete unit or sold piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examine every item or class of equipment individually and write a specific initial storage/mothball technique plus a methodology for ongoing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the purposes of this article, let&amp;rsquo;s consider an item of equipment or a whole plant that might restart as early as six to nine months but could also be several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unused plants and equipment that are properly prepared for shutdown and left in fairly good condition can retain much of their value. However, if a plant is left &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo; and allowed to deteriorate, as is normally the case, much of it can be fit only as scrap in just a matter of months. Engaging in a well-planned process of deactivation/mothballing can be worthwhile either way, whether it should ever be reactivated or just sold for its second-hand value at some future point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Materials and Equipment You Will Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having a clear view of how the constant foes of galvanic/bio corrosion, mold, mildew, etc., can be mitigated if not defeated is essential. Although much will depend on local conditions, the wetter and colder situations are much more challenging in terms of handling humidity, while blowing dust is an issue for those in the high desert regions. For this article, we will consider a central United States or European location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A useful analogy in developing a strategy is to compare what it takes to maintain fire. In the case of fire, there are three essential legs: heat, a fuel source and oxygen. Likewise, age-related deterioration involves a driving force (such as galvanic action), a conducting medium (electrolyte) and oxygen. The fundamental approach to stopping or slowing this age-related deterioration is to remove one or more of the three legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In simple terms, we aim to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Separate dissimilar metals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Protect surfaces that could be attacked, even with a covering of only a few molecules thick.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dry out or remove the conducting medium (electrolyte &amp;mdash; air or gas). Corrosion cannot occur when parts are stored in environments where the relative humidity is held below 40 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove any oxygen or sources of chemical or biological attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The materials we can use are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Liquid protective waxes and liquid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coating &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These can be sprayed on any clean, dry surface to protect them. Wherever it is applied, PVC will form a tough, flexible, waterproof skin that will withstand the extremes of temperature, thermal shock, differential substrate movement and impingement even when sprayed on webbing to form a cocoon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCIs) &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These generate protective vapors even at room temperatures. They come in a number of convenient forms, including time-release vaporizers, sprays, plastic bags and films, powders, oil additives and coatings. They are adsorbed onto the metallic surfaces of the equipment (just a few molecules thick), where they can prevent corrosion for up to two years. While most VCIs are environmentally friendly and create no safety hazards for employees, there are some that are suspected of being harmful. Most contain no toxic substances, such as nitrates or chromates. (Note: Volatile organic compounds should not be used in combination with a desiccant.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Vapor space inhibitor (VSI) &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;This is an oily concentrate that can be added to lubricating oil systems (internal combustion engines, etc.) when equipment is not going to be completely filled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Heat-shrinkable plastic films &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are ideal for enclosing individual machines that have been cleaned and dried and have internal desiccants added.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;VCI-covered polythene films &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used to wrap individual smaller components.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Chemical oxygen scavengers &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are frequently added to fresh water used to displace more corrosive liquid in systems that can&amp;rsquo;t be effectively cleaned or dried out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Chemical inhibitors &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are added to liquids and chemicals and are designed to remove unwanted products while preferentially inhibiting their attack on the body of the container. (Antifreeze sometimes used in this process contains them.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Desiccants &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These include numerous substances (solids) that absorb water from gases (air) or liquids.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Biocides &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used to prevent microbial growths in water and fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Light waxes &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used as surface protectors for metals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Sacrificial Anodes &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used in tanks that cannot be drained of their contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The primary pieces of equipment are dehumidifiers. These are available in two forms: those that work on the refrigeration principle and those that use two-cycle rotary (wheel) heated desiccant absorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Strategies by Equipment Class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before considering individual techniques, make a best guess of the duration and whether it is going to be an &amp;ldquo;attended monitored&amp;rdquo; lay-up or a &amp;ldquo;walk-away&amp;rdquo; lay-up. This article is simply a guide and is not intended to be totally comprehensive and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tanks, Pressure Vessels and Pipework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is essential that tanks, pressure vessels and pipework be left as clean and dry as possible. Insert line blinds to create manageable zones that can be slightly pressurized (0.5 psig+) using nitrogen or dry air. Include some small flow and arrange for some simple telltale mechanism to show pressure flow and the level of humidity (indicator cards). For large enclosures, use a commercial dehumidifier of an appropriate capacity. For vessels, tanks and containments that must be kept full of liquid, some form of oxygen scavenger or anti-biological growth chemical can be used (see boilers). If a pipework system contains any traps, have its internals removed and clear all strainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Boilers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boilers can be laid up using either the long-term dry method or the hydrazine wet lay-up method, which involves leaving the wet side (boiler, economizer and super heater) full of feed-treated water. The feed water is dosed with 15 percent hydrazine and then pH-adjusted to raise the alkalinity to a minimum pH of 8.3. The fire side is supplied with heated air, with desiccant as a backup. Both water-side and fire-side points should have new gaskets, except for furnace hot-air entry inspection and exit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pumps, Engines, Compressors and Machinery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To minimize internal corrosion, close off all vents and openings, and completely fill the casing with the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommended lubricant. Alternatively, add a volatile corrosion inhibitor in the correct proportion to the lubricating oil. For large compressors, turbines, etc., first centrifuge/circulate the existing oil using a portable filtration cart through water-absorbing filter elements to remove any free water. For diesel and gasoline engines, drain the fuel systems and add biocide to the remaining fuel. To prevent external corrosion, if unpainted, one of the recommended spray-on coatings should be used (either a light wax or liquid PVC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Instruments/Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintaining the driest possible conditions for both electronics and external field devices, including sensors, transmitters and valves, can be achieved by strategic placement of desiccant packages and sealing the enclosures. This should be supplemented by placing small containers of VCI powder wherever possible. These will not adversely affect electronics. Instruments that normally would be in contact with the process materials should be removed, cleaned, protected and marked for immediate local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Electrical Enclosures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seal and insert bags or wraps of desiccants and containers of volatile corrosion inhibitors. Alternatively, heat using individual strip or built-in heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Motors and Generators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean the exterior, grease and apply a protective covering. If completely sealed, add packets of desiccant. Lift carbon brushes from commutators/slip rings. Where sleeve-type bearings are fitted, a VSI concentrate should be added to the lubrication system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Exercising and Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the time involved, it will be necessary to periodically exercise equipment by rotating it several times and leaving it at a different (90-degree) angle. Where humidity controls have been set, these need at least weekly monitoring. Where chemical controls are used, these should be checked every three months. Periodic monitoring of motor/generator internal resistance, as well as tank oxygen levels and humidity levels, is necessary for long-term lay-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Auxiliaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases, various fire-protection systems and alarms still need to be maintained and powered up. Fires are common in dried-out cooling towers. If batteries are normally used, disconnect them and smear the terminals with petroleum jelly. Vented-type lead-acid batteries should first be fully charged, then drained and flushed with distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Final Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent discussion with two major plant-dismantling/second-hand equipment vendors revealed that currently there are very few people looking for used equipment, and many idle plants are being offered for sale. They reported that when the decision to shut down comes, most companies remove anything that could present an immediate danger but essentially close the doors and walk away from millions of dollars&amp;rsquo; worth of equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/gNUtJHO1oq0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota Named Company of the Year by Columbus Chamber of Commerce</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/23/ae45e07e-5289-4fe0-acbc-a426f1933567_toyota award.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 179px; float: left;" /&gt;Toyota&amp;rsquo;s Columbus, Ind., manufacturing plant, Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. (TIEM), has been named &amp;ldquo;Company of the Year&amp;rdquo; by the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce. TIEM was presented the award at the chamber&amp;rsquo;s recent annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Toyota is very honored by this recognition,&amp;rdquo; said Toshiya Yamagishi, president of TIEM. &amp;ldquo;As a company, we are committed to enhancing our associates&amp;rsquo; quality of life and contributing to the overall success of our community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, the chamber bestows a number of awards of distinction in order to foster a culture of excellence. These awards recognize extraordinary contributions from the business community that reflect positively on the quality and expertise of the Columbus, Ind., community. TIEM was selected as the &amp;ldquo;Company of the Year&amp;rdquo; because of distinctive accomplishments that impacted associates, the community and the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chamber recognized TIEM&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The establishment of a recovery plan soon after Japan&amp;rsquo;s 2011 earthquake and tsunami that adjusted work schedules and allowed associates to continue 40-hour work weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TIEM&amp;rsquo;s zero-landfill facility designation achieved by shifting to a waste-to-energy facility and implementing recycling programs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The addition of new risk-assessment training, which resulted in a 65-percent reduction in safety incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The integration of a total plant maintenance program that reduced emergency repairs to just 11 percent of overall maintenance performed in 2009 and enabled the cost-per-hour of downtime to be reduced by 10 percent in the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TIEM designs, manufactures and supplies Toyota lift trucks and parts associated with Toyota lift trucks and tow tractors, and assembles motor vehicle parts and accessories. The facility, which was named a 2011 North American Best Plant by &lt;em&gt;IndustryWeek &lt;/em&gt;magazine, is a member of the National Safety Council, complies with the ISO 14001 standard from the International Organization for Standardization and has produced more than 400,000 Toyota lift trucks since its opening in 1990.

            <title>Pfannenberg Introduces Alarm Sounder</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/21/d929c6a4-b3a4-4a75-b3a0-a047e98f1ebf_pfannenberg.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 328px; height: 308px; float: left;" /&gt;Pfannenberg has introduced an audible alarm sounder that is specifically designed to conform with safety integrity level (SIL) 1 and 2 systems. Model DS 10-SIL capitalizes on the technology of the company&amp;rsquo;s workhorse model DS 10 and features an output of 110 decibels, a cast aluminum housing and a legacy for dependable signaling on machinery, heavy equipment and in tough industrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enhancements for the SIL version include self-monitoring circuitry and fault-indicating contact closures to alert of failure or initiate shutdown /lockout of machinery until corrective action can be achieved, thus eliminating the need for redundant devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DS 10-SIL also incorporates full statistical data supporting conformity to SIL 1 and SIL 2 requirements, a menu of 32 unique alarm tones and the ability to remotely trigger up to four selected tones. Target applications for the DS 10-SIL include machinery start-up alarms, process failure alarms, machine guard muting alarms and evacuation alarms for toxic gas leaks and chemical spills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Safety engineers can now deploy audible alarms that are specifically designed for fulfilling their safety instrumented system requirements and achieving their target SIL ratings,&amp;rdquo; says product manager Ray Limburg. &amp;ldquo;With SIL-conforming signaling devices, the associated operational risks are better mitigated, leading to a reduction in potential liability surrounding a mishap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Hamburg, Germany, Pfannenberg has branches, production sites and agents in 44 countries around the world, including Lancaster, N.Y., where the company produces field-tested visual and audible devices for alarm, warning and indication.

            <title>Achieving Zero Failures is Possible</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In his book, &amp;ldquo;Making Common Sense Common Practice,&amp;rdquo; Ron Moore of the RM Group explains that plant safety and reliability are linked and interrelated. He acknowledges that you can get better safety performance by solely focusing on improving safety practices (e.g., wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), implementing better permitting, using proper lockout/tagout procedures, etc.). However, Moore is also of the firm belief that best-performing plants are very disciplined about all their practices, and from that get a synergistic effect in all of their performance measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figures 1 and 2 show examples from a larger set of data that demonstrate the strong correlation between reliability (asset utilization capability) and safety (injury rate). This supports the statement that a more reliable plant is a safer plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/20/93eda360-794b-4022-9d14-567d234cadec_zero failures1.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 291px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/20/6c5c0f28-e997-44ec-93fa-8e0eeee232eb_zero failures2.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 302px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My experience supports Moore&amp;rsquo;s sentiments. I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced a significant change process with Cargill over the past 30 years regarding safety. We are in some businesses that traditionally have been considered not conducive to good safety results. It was thought to be impossible to keep people from getting hurt. We have found this to be untrue. More importantly, we have found that a change in attitude, leadership and actions were needed to achieve this. The culture progressed from one where injuries were part of the business to an attitude where &amp;ldquo;zero injuries are possible in any business anywhere in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our company&amp;rsquo;s safety progress has been a 30-year journey of improved annual results. These results are measured in a safety index number &amp;mdash; a proprietary calculation of reported injury frequency rate (RIFR), disabling frequency rate (DFR) and severity rate (SR). The lower the score, the better the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill&amp;rsquo;s safety index measurement has been used to drive better safety performance. We have seen the index decrease from 100 in the late 1970s to less than 2 today. Many companies now believe that a zero injury rate is a legitimate goal. It has become part of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that zero failures in reliability can also be achieved. In my travels, when I ask people if they believe if this is possible, most emphatically say, &amp;ldquo;No way.&amp;rdquo; They believe it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, much the same way they believed 10 to 20 years ago that zero injuries would be impossible. Yet there are plants that have nearly achieved the goal of zero failures along with zero injuries. These plants have experienced many days and weeks where nothing fails unexpectedly. These sites understand all of the failure modes of their assets and their assets&amp;rsquo; current health. If and when a defect enters the asset, the defect is corrected early and failure is prevented. They are convinced that zero is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Experiences and data show that zero failures are possible. As someone once said, &amp;ldquo;If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re probably right. If you think you can, you&amp;rsquo;re probably right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/8icYjjQn08Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lean Principles Help Bus Company Reduce Downtime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Collins Bus Corporation in Hutchinson, Kan., recently reinvented itself through implementation of lean manufacturing principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On peak days, Collins Bus used multiple 55-gallon drums of undercoating per day. The problem was the company experienced excessive overspray of its undercoating. The overspray drifted into the plant, creating a hazard for plant personnel. The overspray also fell onto finished buses, causing additional clean-up and thus additional production delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to these issues, the 55-gallon drums installed in the spray booth caused further production delays, because when a drum emptied, spray operations had to stop until another drum could be installed. This took a half hour or more out of production for each changeover to a new drum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Daubert Chemical took a proactive role in helping Collins Bus achieve its objectives by first examining how it could solve the overspray situation. The result was a reformulation of the undercoating, which became Tectyl 6430. This water-based asphaltic coating with a chemical additive decreased product drag, offered better atomization at the spray-gun tip and thus reduced the overspray of the product. The new product also was formulated at a lower viscosity, allowing the use of drums or 330-gallon totes for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These and other modifications saved up to 1&amp;frac12; hours of downtime per day in changeovers, eliminated the complications of clean-up due to the previous overspray problems and improved plant safety. The company was even recognized as a national model for workplace safety and health by OSHA and the Kansas Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/10/1bf372b6-0c5a-4617-b34a-ff27163d4904_Daubert Chemical Press Release.jpeg" style="width: 608px; height: 404px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Previously at Collins Bus Corporation, the undercoating had been delivered in 55-gallon drums, resulting in downtime when they were emptied. The modified Tectyl undercoating allowed the product to be delivered via a 330-gallon tote system. When one tote was emptied, the valve was closed and the second tote valve was opened with no interruptions to production.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Crown Equipment Earns Recognition from National Safety Council</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Crown Equipment Corporation recently announced that eight of its facilities have received lift-truck operator awards from the National Safety Council for outstanding safety practices. The award recognizes forklift operators for operator excellence in lift-truck operations by operating lift-truck fleets without recordable or lost-time injuries. The seven manufacturing facilities and one distribution center are all located in Ohio and support Crown&amp;rsquo;s global business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is not the first time Crown and its facilities have been recognized by the National Safety Council. In 2010, the company received an Occupational Excellence Achievement Award for its achievements and implementation of effective safety programs and initiatives. In that same year, the company&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing facility in Greencastle, Ind., was recognized for achieving 1 million consecutive man-hours (10 years) without a lost-time injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Crown Equipment, we take great pride in safety excellence, both in our manufacturing facilities and processes, as well as working with our customers on best practices for forklift safety,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Duffy, director of corporate environment and manufacturing safety for Crown Equipment. &amp;ldquo;Major contributors to the continued success of our corporate safety initiatives include internal usage of our Crown training programs, including DP LeadSafe for supervisors and DP TrainSafe for trainers, as well as Crown&amp;rsquo;s InfoLink system and the company&amp;rsquo;s SafeSteps program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The InfoLink wireless fleet and operator management system helps the company maintain compliance with workplace regulations and safety standards by monitoring impacts. The company is also using the system to limit access to operators with the required certifications and to ensure that required inspections are performed with proper attention to detail. It&amp;rsquo;s also sending managers notifications of upcoming training and maintenance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s SafeSteps program has enabled the company to dramatically shift the culture of safety to be self-directed and owned by its employees. The program uses employee observation, feedback and positive reinforcement, as well as management support to focus on the behavioral aspects of safety. The comprehensive safety program provides an anonymous, discipline-free approach to safety that is unique for a manufacturing environment. Employees recognize and evaluate fellow employees on the safety techniques they&amp;rsquo;re performing correctly rather than solely focusing on unsafe behavior. This fosters a positive learning environment that allows Crown to keep employee health and safety as a top priority, as well as ensure productivity and efficiency in its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honeywell Adsorbents Used to Remove Radiation at Japanese Nuclear Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	UOP LLC, a Honeywell company, recently announced that its adsorbent ion-exchange products are successfully being used by Toshiba Corporation and Shaw Global Services LLC for the cleanup of radiation-contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Japan&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Simplified Active Water Retrieve and Recovery System (SARRY) is utilizing UOP IONSIV Ion Exchangers to remove and reduce radioactive materials in the contaminated wastewater.

            <title>Corporate Culture Cited as Root Cause of Mine Disaster</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recently announced that it has imposed a fine of more than $10 million following its investigation into the April 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch-South Mine, which was operated by Performance Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The explosion killed 29 miners and injured two, making it the worst U.S. coal mining disaster in 40 years. A report concluded that Massey&amp;#39;s corporate culture was the root cause of the tragedy. MSHA has issued Massey and PCC 369 citations and orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The tragic explosion at Upper Big Branch left dozens of families without husbands, fathers, brothers and sons,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;I made a pledge to the families of those we lost and the entire mining community to conduct the most complete and thorough investigation possible in order to find the cause of this disaster. The results of the investigation lead to the conclusion that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, and broke the law as they endangered the lives of their miners. By issuing the largest fine in MSHA&amp;#39;s history, I hope to send a strong message that the safety of miners must come first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The agency&amp;#39;s presentation of findings follows a non-prosecution agreement among the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia, the U.S. Department of Justice, Alpha Natural Resources Inc. and Alpha Appalachia Holdings Inc., formerly known as Massey Energy Co. The agreement, which includes nearly $210 million for remedial safety measures at all Alpha mines, a trust fund for improvements in mine safety and health, payment of outstanding civil penalties for all former Massey mines and restitution payments for the victims&amp;#39; families, resolves criminal liability for Alpha but does not provide protection against criminal prosecution of any individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This agreement can go a long way toward changing a safety culture that was clearly broken at Massey&amp;#39;s mines,&amp;quot; said Solis. &amp;quot;Although this agreement is significant, it in no way absolves any individuals responsible for this terrible tragedy of their criminal liability. We will continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney&amp;#39;s Office to ensure that the responsible parties will be brought to justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA concluded that the 29 miners died in a massive coal dust explosion that started as a methane ignition. While the investigation found the physical conditions that led to the coal dust explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB, which PCC and Massey disregarded, the report cites unlawful policies and practices implemented by PCC and Massey as the root cause of the explosion, including the intimidation of miners, advance notice of inspections and two sets of books with hazards recorded in UBB&amp;#39;s internal production and maintenance book but not in the official examination book. The investigation also discovered that the operator promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Every time Massey sent miners into the UBB Mine, Massey put those miners&amp;#39; lives at risk,&amp;quot; said MSHA assistant secretary Joseph A. Main. &amp;ldquo;Massey management created a culture of fear and intimidation in their miners to hide their reckless practices. Today&amp;#39;s report brings to light the tragic consequences of a corporate culture that values production over people. The secretary and I are committed to improving the health and safety of America&amp;#39;s miners. To honor the memory of the lives lost at UBB, we will use the lessons learned from this terrible tragedy to fulfill that commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA issued PCC and Massey 12 citations and orders deemed contributory to the cause of the accident, and nine of those violations were assessed as flagrant, which carry the highest possible penalties. Violations include illegally providing advance notice to miners of MSHA inspections; failing to properly conduct required examinations; allowing hazardous levels of loose coal, coal dust and float coal dust to accumulate; failing to adequately apply rock dust to the mine; failing to adequately train miners; and failing to comply with approved ventilation plans and approved roof control plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA also issued 357 citations and orders to PCC and Massey that did not contribute directly to the explosion, including 11 assessed as flagrant. Additionally, MSHA issued two contributory and two non-contributory violations to David Stanley Consulting LLC, a contractor that supplied examiners and other miners to work at UBB, for its examiner&amp;#39;s failure to properly conduct examinations. These violations carry penalties of $142,684.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The accident investigation report, along with supplementary documents, is available on the agency&amp;#39;s UBB single source page at &lt;a href="http://www.msha.gov/PerformanceCoal/PerformanceCoal.asp" target="_blank"&gt;www.msha.gov/PerformanceCoal/PerformanceCoal.asp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/sXY697iVzmQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Nalco Plant Named Louisiana SAFE Award Winner</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nalco has announced that its plant in Garyville, La., has been honored by the Louisiana Chemical Association (LCA) with a 2011 SAFE (Serious About Fostering Excellence) Award for the facility&amp;#39;s environmental and safety performance and community outreach efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Garyville Plant was recognized as the best in Louisiana for class two locations with 101 to 200 full-time employees. The SAFE program evaluates a plant&amp;#39;s performance in employee safety, contractor safety, environmental efforts and &amp;quot;good neighbor&amp;quot; activities with local communities. Winners are selected from almost 100 facilities statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Health and safety, strong environmental performance and keeping our plants, products and people secure are top priorities for all LCA members,&amp;quot; said Dan Borne, LCA president. &amp;quot;Chemical manufacturers work relentlessly on this because great performance every day in these critical areas is equally important to folks who live in communities where plants operate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Garyville Plant is Nalco&amp;#39;s largest manufacturing site in the world. It is the second time in the past four years the plant has received the SAFE award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Safety is a core value at Nalco,&amp;quot; said plant manager Carl Pasquarelli. &amp;quot;We make safety personal for our employees, and our target is always zero &amp;ndash; zero emissions, accidents and injuries. We also believe in supporting our community, including our Adopt a School programs, United Way contributions, the American Cancer Society, St. James Parish 4-H and the Garyville Volunteer Fire Department and other groups.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year Nalco&amp;#39;s Garyville plant was also honored by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality for the facility&amp;#39;s environmental and pollution prevention efforts. It is the second straight year the plant has been recognized with an Environmental Leadership Program Award.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Georgia-Pacific Names Winner of Great American Worker Contest</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/29/ced82b0e-01d6-4607-b0d9-13e3414e168c_Georgia-Pacific-2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 131px; float: left;" /&gt;After a nationwide search to find America&amp;rsquo;s greatest and most hard-working heroes, Georgia-Pacific Professional recently named James Bennett of Harlingen, Texas, as the winner of the 2011 Brawny Industrial Great American Worker Contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bennett, an engineering manager at Cardone Industries, was selected as the national winner because of his leadership in streamlining processes, educating and mentoring his co-workers and his complete dedication to his job. In addition to being named the Brawny Industrial Great American Worker, Bennett is also a winner of a new 2011 Ford F-150 truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The contest, which ran from January through June, called for supervisors, co-workers, family and peers to submit a short nomination about someone who excels in their workplace and demonstrates the qualities of a true great American worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Mr. Bennett is a hard worker and role model in his workplace and community &amp;ndash; values that we embrace and support,&amp;rdquo; said Ken Smith, vice president at Georgia-Pacific Professional. &amp;ldquo;We are proud to call him the 2011 Brawny Industrial Great American Worker and hope that he inspires others to follow his leadership and contribute positively to their workplace and the communities where they live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Monday, Sept. 19, 2011, Georgia-Pacific Professional hosted a ceremony for Bennett at the Harlingen Chamber of Commerce, where he was awarded a new 2011 Ford F-150 truck. Friends, family and co-workers, along with several members of the Georgia-Pacific Professional team, attended the event and honored Bennett for his achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I am reminded of all the hard work that goes into the&amp;nbsp;production and manufacturing of goods and services in this country, and I am honored to be named the Brawny Industrial Great American Worker and represent the many dedicated&amp;nbsp;workers who labor each day,&amp;rdquo; Bennett stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to naming a national Great American Worker, Georgia-Pacific Professional also recognized three individuals who excelled in the categories of work safety, worker productivity and community involvement &amp;ndash; all of which are key elements that make up a Great American Worker. Each category winner was awarded a $3,500 cash prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The work safety category winner was Kenneth Kresen, a truck driver for Dayton Freight in Cicero, Ill. Kenneth Mounts, owner of Calibrated Controls Inc., in Escondido, Calif., was named the category winner for worker productivity. Chris Ronnebaum, vice president of Field Operations at Hawkeye Construction in Baltimore, Md., was the community involvement category winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The individuals who nominated the Great American Worker grand-prize winner and each of the category winners were also awarded a $1,000 cash prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several industry experts participated in the judging portion of the contest. These individuals were asked to assist as judges based on their experience and knowledge in the manufacturing and industrial supply industries, and included editors from &lt;em&gt;Industrial Supply&lt;/em&gt; magazine and ReliablePlant.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We would like to thank all of the individuals who participated in this year&amp;rsquo;s Brawny Industrial Great American Worker contest, including our celebrity guest judges,&amp;rdquo; continues Smith. &amp;ldquo;Georgia-Pacific Professional is dedicated to creating personal relationships with its customers, and we look forward to hosting another contest in 2012.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Reliability Excellence is Imperative for Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We tend to speak about financial issues more than moral issues in the business world. Safety is an issue that has significant ramifications from both moral and financial perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety is a financial imperative in today&amp;rsquo;s business world. According to a 2010 Liberty Mutual study, the annual documented direct and indirect industry cost of U.S. workplace accidents totaled $240 billion per year. The average cost to industry for a fatal accident ranges from a low estimate by the National Safety Council of $1.27 million to the enormous average of $8.6 million per fatality paid out by BP after its refinery explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to an Air Force study, the average cost of a permanent disability is $1.3 million, while a partial disability costs $210,000. Workers&amp;rsquo; compensation premiums, which correlate directly to your accident and incident rate, amount to millions of dollars per year in even a modest-sized company. Any way you look at it, accidents are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dollars and cents aside, no manager or supervisor wants to ever have to face a distraught family and tell them that their spouse or parent will not be coming home tonight. It is hard to look an employee in the eye at the hospital when you know that his or her injuries could have been avoided. Even minor injuries can take a serious toll physically, mentally and economically on everyone involved. I think we can all agree that accidents are an employee event that industry does not want to pay for and nobody ever wants to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The premise of this article is that facilities that rank high in terms of reliability excellence also have superior safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There have been some statistics published that show the relationship between recognized measures of reliability and an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety performance. The source data has not been all that well-documented, but the relationship has been observed many times. Improving safety should be seen as the journey toward reliability excellence proceeds. Rather than focusing on boring cost data and correlations, let&amp;rsquo;s explore why a state of reliability excellence supports excellence in safety performance. For it is from the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; that you can learn how to improve safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the 2010 survey, the top five types of accidents in terms of compensation were falls, electrocutions, injuries from working in confined spaces, fires and explosions, and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The causes of these accidents have their roots in unsafe conditions and unsafe behaviors. Both of these factors are positively influenced by the journey to reliability excellence. What sort of unsafe conditions and behaviors exist in reactive facilities that &lt;u&gt;do not exist&lt;/u&gt; where reliability excellence is in place? Here are a few common ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leaks and spills that contribute to falls and some fires exist in plants where maintenance people are not deployed efficiently and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; defects like these have to be tolerated. Operators do not keep the equipment clean and in good order. Thus, the sources of leaks are not identified and corrected easily at an early stage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Falls often result from temporary hoses and pipes, poorly barricaded &amp;ldquo;emergency work&amp;rdquo; areas, and the seemingly inevitable debris that there is &amp;ldquo;never time to clean up&amp;rdquo; before proceeding to the next emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Electrocutions often occur because of poorly maintained electrical grounding systems and power tools. In a reactive facility, there never seems to be enough time to ensure that grounding checks are made, and that GFCIs are always used. Other electrocutions occur during emergency troubleshooting and repair of equipment. Often there is &amp;ldquo;not enough time&amp;rdquo; or the organizational discipline is lacking to perform LOTO consistently. Poorly planned high work near power lines is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Confined space injuries occur largely because of the lack of individual or supervisory discipline within the organization necessary to adhere to confined space procedures. Poor job planning and insufficient preparation for confined space entry also play a role. The absence of consistent employee training is often cited. Constant job interruptions and the rush associated with urgent work compound the situation by contributing to poor decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Although falls account for the largest number of fatalities, fires and explosions always get attention. When you dig into the root causes of fires and explosions, you come across these contributors: poor configuration management (control of alterations to materials, process and procedures), leaks and spills, and lack of a disciplined adherence to procedures. In a reactive plant, procedures get bypassed and alterations and material substitutions are made to compensate for emergencies and poor material management systems. Leaks, spills and general poor housekeeping literally &amp;ldquo;add fuel to the fire&amp;rdquo; when one occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Burns not occurring as a result of fire are often attributed to hot liquid leaks. Leaks abound in reactive plants. In process plants, a very common cause is poor thermal protection condition, such as pipes and vessels with missing or damaged insulation. In a reactive facility, costs are high and manpower is generally scarce. Often one of the first things to be sacrificed is &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; leak repairs and the condition of insulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These fundamental root causes are present in the top five accident types. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how a reliability excellenceenvironment mitigates or eliminates these root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Procedures and Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No procedures or poor discipline to follow existing ones are characteristic of a reactive environment. Within reliability excellence, work processes and procedures are fundamental. Creation of process and procedure is one of the first steps taken in the implementation of reliability excellence. Discipline results from setting expectations, measuring results and holding people accountable. It is also the reliability excellenceresult of establishing a culture that encourages and rewards a disciplined approach. Disciplined does not mean stagnant. Structured continuous improvement is an integral part of reliability excellence, but the days of the &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cowboys&amp;rdquo; are over. Reliability excellenceemploys the principles of change management to develop the right culture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Poor or no job planning and a high level of emergencies set the stage for accidents. Lack of planning forces people to hurry and &amp;ldquo;make it up as they go,&amp;rdquo; creating opportunities for errors. In the reliability excellenceenvironment, more than 90 percent of jobs are planned and scheduled. Emergencies are few because effective preventive maintenance programs are in place. Chronic failures are systematically identified and corrected, and the root causes eliminated by loss and failure elimination processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient Maintenance Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reactive sites consume budget money and craft resources in huge quantities. The poor or omitted maintenance that creates an unsafe work environment often exists due to lack of money and people. When good work execution practices are in place as a result of reliability excellence, the productivity of the maintenance organization increases by as much as 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers using effective loss and failure elimination processes significantly reduce the number of chronic failures. These and the preventive and predictive maintenance programs developed and deployed in a reliability excellenceimplementation extend the equipment mean time between failures and eliminate much unnecessary emergency work. The overall cost of maintenance goes down, while the level of maintenance goes up as resources, once poorly utilized reactively, are now available for proactively addressing all of the maintenance needs of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Temporary&amp;rdquo; hoses and pipes as well as debris left behind from emergency repairs or only partially completed maintenance create an unsafe work environment. In a proactive environment, emergency repairs become the exception. Craft people are not pulled away from partially completed jobs to deal with the next emergency. In addition, every job includes the time to render the work area safe and clean before moving to the next job. General housekeeping improves as well. Indeed, 5S is integral to reliability excellence. Clear expectations and scheduled tasks generated by the operator care function result in operators who have the time, the ability and the desire to maintain a clean and safe workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Configuration Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uncontrolled changes often create unsafe process and equipment conditions. There is a history of major industrial accidents resulting from poor control of changes. Condition monitoring is one of the fundamental components of a reliability excellenceimplementation, thus ensuring an appropriate level of procedural safeguards is in place. Often the need to make changes is the result of a reactive environment. Parts and material substitutions occur when the material management function is not working, and a breakdown occurs. World-class material management practices ensure that the right parts in the right amount are at the right place at the right time. The failure elimination process eradicates most chronic and unpredictable failures. Between the two, much of the need for emergency work-arounds, which are often the drivers for configuration management failures, simply goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Either from neglect by reactive leadership or from lack of necessary resources, training is often poor quality or non-existent. With reliability excellencecomes reduced failure rates, less severe failures, more productive use of craft labor and the ability to schedule effectively. Process interruptions become rare. Both the time and money to train your people become available. The world-class target of 2 percent of labor hours devoted to training becomes not just possible but desirable. Root-cause analysis of failures helps to target specific training needs. Tracking systems that are integral to the process validate the effectiveness of your training dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Decision-Making/Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lack of process, asset and organizational stability in a reactive environment forces people to make decisions under time pressure, often reacting to totally new situations. Process upsets and equipment breakdowns generate overtime, which is frequently excessive and unplanned. This leads to fatigue, which leads to poor decision-making and errors and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human-error rate tables indicate that the average trained and competent person performing a routine repetitive task under no unusual stress will make a mistake roughly once every 500 times he or she performs it. Add fatigue, being in a hurry and having to perform non-routine tasks, and the error rate increases to roughly once in every 25 actions. In the right (or rather wrong) emergency conditions, the error rate can be as much as one in four. It is little wonder that the accident rate is so high at facilities that have unstable processes and unstable equipment. Reliability excellence introduces stability, predictable work schedules and lower stress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Management Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In sites where it is a daily battle to make production and keep poorly maintained assets running, it is hard to find the time to focus on improving safety. When assets and processes are stable and under control, when you have the resources to maintain the facility at peak condition, and budget pressures are lower, then you have the time, energy and ability to focus on safety. Reliability excellence creates this very environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, whether for moral or financial reasons, reliability excellence is an imperative for a safe and profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>NMHG Receives Carolina Star Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/4/e5f161db-d1cc-4c16-866e-797476eac996_Carolina Star1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 188px; float: left;" /&gt;NACCO Materials Handling Group (NMHG), makers of Hyster and Yale lift trucks, recently received the prestigious Carolina Star Safety Award at a ceremony hosted by the North Carolina Department of Labor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to qualify for the award, the company had to pass an initial assessment to prove that its facilities are a safe, healthy and productive work environment. The six elements that constitute the Carolina Star&amp;rsquo;s SEE and ACT requirements are statistics, everyone&amp;rsquo;s commitment, employee involvement, analyze hazards, control risks and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the latest recipient of the Carolina Star Safety Award, NMHG joins a select group of 135 North Carolina sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;NMHG would like to express our gratitude to the North Carolina Department of Labor and Pitt County Chamber of Commerce,&amp;rdquo; said John Gardiner, NMHG&amp;rsquo;s general manager Americas Manufacturing. &amp;ldquo;We are incredibly honored and humbled to be named a Carolina Star Safety Award recipient and join the ranks of Kimberly-Clarke, Pfizer, Frito-Lay and Georgia Pacific, to name a few. It has been a wonderful year of safety milestones for our company, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it without our dedicated employees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to receiving the Carolina Star Safety Award at the ceremony, NMHG was honored with the North Carolina Department of Labor Million-Hour Safety Award and Gold Safety Award for the seventh consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Million-Hour Safety Awards are given to firms that accumulate 1 million employee hours with no case of injury or illness involving days away from work. Last year, NMHG reached 3 million hours without a lost time accident in its Greenville, N.C., facility. Gold Safety Awards include cases of days away from work, restricted activity or job transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leader in the lift truck industry, NMHG designs, engineers, manufactures, sells and services a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally under the Hyster and Yale brand names. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, NMHG employs approximately 4,500 people worldwide and is a wholly owned subsidiary of NACCO Industries, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/g_mbcAC3VOA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ABB Facility Sets Safety Record</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/20/cb349b16-7399-424f-a458-848ac73443f5_ABB New Berlin Group Photo - 2011 - 195.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 195px; height: 130px; float: left;" /&gt;By exceeding 2.5 million hours worked without a lost-time incident at both its New Berlin, Wis., campus and Fort Smith, Ark., facility, ABB has proven that a safety culture and engaged safety teams can help improve bottom-line performance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;At the company&amp;rsquo;s New Berlin facility, the number of employees has increased to more than 100 volunteers serving on numerous safety committees. The strong emphasis on safety helped the campus become the first ABB facility in North America to achieve the OSHA VPP Star Level of performance. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;At the facility in Fort Smith, Ark., ABB employees are actively engaged and volunteering in safety programs. The company&amp;rsquo;s Low Voltage Drives Management Team also is helping to create a safety culture that translates directly to performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;As a visual and practical reminder of this safety consciousness, ABB is presenting employees at the New Berlin and Fort Smith facilities with a sun visor to assist in keeping their automobiles cool and safe during the summer heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DuraLabel Announces Free Printer Loaner Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	DuraLabel has announced that it will provide a free printer for qualified customers who need repairs, cleaning or tune-ups. The benefit is increased productivity and fewer work interruptions. DuraLabel printers are used to create industrial signs and labels for applications such as general safety, arc flash, pipe marking and lockout/tagout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once loaners are received, machines are tested and serviced. Servicing may include updating firmware, updating print headsprings, checking print head alignment and cleaning print head, platen roller, media guides and cutter assemblies. Usually loaners are returned within a week after the original printer is returned. Whenever DuraLabel customers are without a printer and they have a critical labeling job to manage, they receive a loaner.&amp;nbsp;Overnight loaners are available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Customers are usually surprised and delighted to hear about the free loaner because we&amp;rsquo;ve all become so accustomed to paying extra for help,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Stephenson, general manager of graphic products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Industrial Equipment Receives National Safety Council Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;font color="#000000"&gt;Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing Inc.

The National Safety Council tracks data in accordance with the federal OSHA calendar-year standard. During the last calendar year, TIEM achieved a lost-time incident rate less than 7 percent of the average rate in the same business classification.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With TIEM&amp;rsquo;s focus on safety, we see reduced absenteeism, lower turnover rates, higher productivity and better quality products.&amp;quot;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kimberly-Clark Professional Introduces Healthy Workplace Project Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kimberly-Clark Professional has announced a new awards program designed to recognize and reward companies that have made a comprehensive corporate commitment to better hand and surface hygiene in the workplace as well as to the education of its employees in the importance of &amp;quot;wash, wipe and sanitize&amp;quot; office hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Healthy Workplace Project Award, an additional initiative of Kimberly-Clark&amp;#39;s landmark The Healthy Workplace Project, will be awarded to companies that have demonstrated a sustained, significant effort toward breaking the cycle of germ transmission in the workplace. The award recognizes and celebrates the implementation of best practices around office hygiene initiatives as well as employee engagement and education. The announcement of the awards program was made at the 2011 Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) International Conference in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are delighted to introduce a new awards program for companies developing and implementing programs that make our offices a healthier place to be,&amp;quot; said Richard Thorne, vice president of Kimberly-Clark Professional North America. &amp;ldquo;By advocating for and providing education on healthy workplace hygiene habits, businesses can significantly reduce the frequency with which germs are spread throughout the office, creating a positive impact on employee productivity and absenteeism-related expenses. Importantly, a healthier workplace also promotes employee morale and inspires a higher level of engagement between the company and its employee.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Healthy Workplace Project Award is an annual program. Any office environment is eligible to participate, from those operated by building owners, managed by facility managers and, of course, individual offices. The program is self-nominating and applicants will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will serve as their award submission. Participants will be asked to describe the hand and surface hygiene initiatives their company has implemented, as well as any educational programs that have been introduced to reinforce these initiatives. The application also requires a description of how the success of these initiatives is measured. Applications for the awards will be accepted through April 30, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The program will be judged by independent, third-party experts in the fields of workplace health, office hygiene and germ transmission. The judges will be announced this summer. Winners, to include a Gold, Silver and Bronze winning company, will be announced at the 2012 BOMA International Conference in June 2012. In addition to other health and wellness awards the grand prize winner will receive $15,000 worth of hand and surface hygiene products from Kimberly-Clark Professional. The second-place winner will also receive an office-based health and wellness award and will receive $10,000 of products. The third-place winner will receive $5,000 of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Durasol cited for emergency response, respirator, chemical, electrical and other hazards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Durasol Corporation for 13 alleged serious violations of workplace health and safety standards at its Amesbury, Mass., manufacturing plant. The manufacturer of hard gum erasers faces a total of $43,800 in proposed fines.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s inspection found a variety of emergency response, respirator, electrical and chemical hazards. The citations were issued for a lack of an emergency action plan, inadequate employee training in responding to emergencies, inadequate respirator training, lack of respirator fit-testing and medical evaluation, failure to evaluate respiratory hazards, unmarked exit routes, unlabeled containers of chemicals, severely corroded electrical equipment, an extension cord used in place of permanent wiring, inadequately guarded floor holes, missing stair rails, and an uninspected and improperly located emergency eyewash/shower.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA issues a serious citation when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;These citations represent a cross section of deficiencies that, left uncorrected, expose workers to chemical and electrical hazards and to the consequences of not knowing how to respond in the event of an emergency,&amp;quot; said Jeffrey Erskine, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director for Essex and Middlesex counties in Massachusetts. &amp;quot;Prompt and effective corrective action by the company is warranted to ensure the health and well-being of the workers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Durasol Corp. has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with the OSHA area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/0doyDzSP1AU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA cites Miami firm for failing to protect employees from lead exposure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued citations to Lead Enterprises Inc. in Miami, Fla., alleging that the company knowingly neglected to protect employees from lead exposure. The company is being cited with 32 safety and health violations, and $307,200 in total proposed penalties.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;This company was well aware of what it needed to do to protect its workers from a well-known hazard but failed to provide that protection,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;Lead exposure can cause many serious health issues including brain damage, kidney disease and harm to the reproductive system. Such a blatant disregard for OSHA&amp;#39;s lead standard is shameful and will not be tolerated.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lead Enterprises is a lead recycling and manufacturing company that produces lead products, including fish tackle, lead diving weights and lead-lined walls used in medical radiology facilities.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a follow-up to a 2009 inspection, OSHA conducted a July 2010 inspection that resulted in four willful citations and proposed penalties of $224,000. The citations allege violations of OSHA&amp;#39;s lead standard including exposing workers to lead above the permissible exposure limit; not providing engineering controls to reduce exposure; failure to perform ventilation measurements; failure to provide a clean change area; and failure to provide a suitable shower facility for workers exposed to lead above the permissible level. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Additionally, 21 serious citations with proposed penalties of $70,400 allege that Lead Enterprises failed to perform an initial exposure determination for workers who clean the facility, to conduct quarterly monitoring, to notify workers of air monitoring results, to provide appropriate protective clothing, to maintain surfaces free from lead accumulation, to properly store oxygen and acetylene tanks in the facility, properly install production equipment, and to fix or remove defective forklift trucks. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;The management of Lead Enterprises acknowledged awareness of the OSHA lead standard and the dangers associated with lead exposure but continued to allow the hazard to exist, exposing employees to a serious health risk,&amp;quot; said Darlene Fossum, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Fort Lauderdale.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Three repeat citations with a proposed penalty of $11,200 have been issued, alleging that the company failed to cover electrical wires on a furnace fan motor and record injuries on the OSHA recordkeeping forms for 2008 and 2010. A repeat citation is issued when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Two other-than-serious citations were issued with $1,600 in proposed penalties for failing to record instances of medical removal on OSHA 300 logs, and label containers that held lead-contaminated clothing. Two additional other-than-serious citations with no monetary penalties have been issued for failing to certify forklift operators and notify the laundering facility of lead exposure dangers.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In August 2010, OSHA issued citations to E.N. Range Inc. in Miami, a sister company of Lead Enterprises. E.N. Range is the primary lead supplier for Lead Enterprises, and both companies have the same owner. The earlier citations alleged that E.N. Range knowingly neglected to protect employees who clean gun ranges from serious overexposure to lead. E.N. Range also was cited for providing, without medical supervision, non-Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for lead exposure. The company was cited for more than 50 violations of the lead and other standards, with total proposed penalties of $2,099,600. It is currently contesting the citations and penalties.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lead Enterprises has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to comply or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/hyM7zVKfEXM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>NAM says OSHA withdrawal of noise proposal is positive step for job growth</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) vice president for human resources policy Joe Trauger issued the following statement on January 19 regarding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;rsquo;s (OSHA) withdrawal of its proposed changes to noise control requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;OSHA&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal of this unnecessary proposal is a clear sign that the agency heeded the calls of manufacturers regarding the economic impact of these expensive and burdensome noise control requirements. Manufacturers are committed to protecting their employees, but there is no evidence that this proposal would have enhanced workplace safety. Manufacturers hope this decision signals that OSHA will slow down on other costly and unwarranted rules that will crush economic growth and job creation. Today&amp;rsquo;s announcement is an important step in beginning to restore the collaborative relationship between OSHA and employers that has proven over the years to be the most effective approach to improving workplace safety. With the unemployment rate still hovering at unacceptable levels, we encourage the Administration to continue its focus on reducing excessive government regulations to clear the way for job creation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The National Association of Manufacturers is the largest manufacturing association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing has a presence in every single congressional district providing good, high-paying jobs.

            <title>OSHA withdraws proposed interpretation of occupational noise</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration on January 19 announced that it is withdrawing its proposed interpretation titled &amp;ldquo;Interpretation of OSHA&amp;rsquo;s Provisions for Feasible Administrative or Engineering Controls of Occupational Noise.&amp;rdquo; The interpretation would have clarified the term &amp;ldquo;feasible administrative or engineering controls&amp;rdquo; as used in OSHA&amp;rsquo;s noise standard. The proposed interpretation was published in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt; on October 19, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hearing loss caused by excessive noise levels remains a serious occupational health problem in this country,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;ldquo;However, it is clear from the concerns raised about this proposal that addressing this problem requires much more public outreach and many more resources than we had originally anticipated. We are sensitive to the possible costs associated with improving worker protection and have decided to suspend work on this proposed modification while we study other approaches to abating workplace noise hazards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michaels met earlier this month with the offices of Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, in response to a letter from the senators. Sens. Snowe and Lieberman are also co-chairs of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thousands of workers every year continue to suffer from preventable hearing loss due to high workplace noise levels. Since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that nearly 125,000 workers have suffered significant, permanent hearing loss. In 2008 alone, BLS reported more than 22,000 hearing loss cases, and Michaels emphasized that OSHA remains committed to finding ways to reduce this toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of this effort, the agency will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conduct a thorough review of comments that have been submitted in response to the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt; notice and of any other information it receives on this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hold a stakeholder meeting on preventing occupational hearing loss to elicit the views of employers, workers, and noise control and public health professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consult with experts from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the National Academy of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Initiate a robust outreach and compliance assistance effort to provide enhanced technical information and guidance on the many inexpensive, effective engineering controls for dangerous noise levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For small businesses, OSHA&amp;rsquo;s On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice on health and safety solutions with priority given to high-hazard worksites. Through this program, small and medium-sized employers can obtain free advice on addressing noise hazards. On-site consultation services exist in every state, and they are independent from OSHA&amp;rsquo;s enforcement efforts. On-site Consultation Program consultants, employed by state agencies or universities, work with employers to identify workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in establishing safety and health management systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/UUJrCIicP00" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Poll: Fortune 500 firms prohibit employees from using cell phones while driving</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One out of five Fortune 500 companies that responded to a recent National Safety Council survey has a total ban on cell phone use while driving that covers all employees. More than half of these policies were implemented since 2008 &amp;ndash; indicating corporate America is heeding the public&amp;rsquo;s growing call to eliminate cell phone use behind the wheel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two years after the National Safety Council urged motorists to stop using cell phones and messaging devices while driving, these employee bans are evidence of progress in reducing the number of distracted drivers on the road. However, thousands of Americans still die each year in distracted driving-related crashes, and research shows cell phones are the No. 1 distraction in vehicles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In &lt;a href="http://www.nsc.org/Pages/NationalSafetyCouncilCallsforNationwideBanonCellPhoneUseWhileDriving.aspx" target="_blank" title=""&gt;January 2009&lt;/a&gt;, NSC called for a ban on all cell phone use while driving because research identified the behavior as dangerous. A driver is four times as likely to crash while talking on a cell phone while driving,&amp;rdquo; said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the council. &amp;ldquo;Now, in 2011, our call to action is getting results, and our nation&amp;rsquo;s top employers are taking steps to protect their employees and communities in which they operate by implementing total cell phone bans.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Preliminary survey &lt;a href="http://www.nsc.org/Documents/Fortune%20500.pdf" target="_blank" title=""&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicate productivity either increased or remained at the same level for 40 percent of companies with total bans. (About half of the companies with total bans implemented their policies recently and do not yet know if productivity has been affected.) The Council&amp;rsquo;s free &lt;a href="http://www.nsc.org/SAFETY_ROAD/DISTRACTED_DRIVING/Pages/EmployerPolicies.aspx" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Cell Phone Policy Kit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has more information on implementing a policy in the workplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NSC estimates at least 23 percent of all motor vehicle crashes each year involve cell phone use, and more than 50 research studies show talking or texting on a cell phone while driving is a dangerous behavior. Cell phone conversations account for the majority of crashes involving cell phone use. Research shows a driver having a cell phone conversation may miss up to half of his or her driving environment, meaning important visual cues such as pedestrians, stop signs and other obstacles could be missed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Allowing employees to use cell phones while driving may mean incurring significant corporate liability. Companies that have implemented cell phone policies understand this potential risk. Crash scenarios in which employers have been liable include employees who were driving:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		During work hours and outside typical work hours&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To or from work appointments and for personal reasons&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In business or personal vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While having business and personal conversations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While using employer-provided and employee-owned phones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While using hands-free and handheld devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the council&amp;rsquo;s call to keep roadways safer, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has called&amp;nbsp;upon employers to prohibit any practice that requires or encourages employees to text while driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also issued a &lt;a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/rulemakings/rule-programs/rule_making_details.aspx?ruleid=323" target="_blank" title=""&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;banning commercial vehicle drivers from texting while driving and in December 2010 &lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;it was accepting public comment on whether that ban should extend to talking on a handheld cell phone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The National Safety Council (&lt;a href="http://www.nsc.org/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;www.nsc.org&lt;/a&gt;) saves lives by preventing injuries and deaths at work, in homes and communities, and on the roads through leadership, research, education and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/vvN4yj0TXm8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Survey: 72% of workers go to work when they are sick</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Sniff, sniff. Achoo! With cold and flu season in full swing, these sounds are likely to be heard around the office. A new CareerBuilder survey finds that nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of workers typically go to work when they are sick. Workplace pressures and &amp;quot;presenteeism&amp;quot; may be causing workers to go in under the weather, as more than half (55 percent) of workers said they feel guilty if they call in sick. The CareerBuilder survey was conducted nationwide from &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;November 15 to December 2, 2010&lt;/span&gt; among more than 3,700 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With so many workers heading to work ill, they are likely passing their germs on to others. More than half of workers (53 percent) said they have gotten sick from a co-worker who came to the office sick, while 12 percent said they picked up a bug from someone who was sick on public transportation going to or from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s important for employees to take care of their health and the health of others by staying at home if they aren&amp;#39;t feeling well,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Rosemary Haefner&lt;/span&gt;, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder. &amp;quot;Even if workers feel pressure to be at the office, they should talk to their managers about staying home if they are sick, or ask about other options such as working remotely. Most employers are flexible and understand that employees are more productive if they are feeling their best.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help encourage a healthy workplace, nearly one-in-five (19 percent) employees said their companies provided flu shots at their office. Nearly two-in-five workers (38 percent) said they were proactive and got a flu shot this year. When workers were asked what other ways they attempt to avoid germs, they said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wash my hands often &amp;ndash; 78 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I carry hand sanitizer with me and use it often &amp;ndash; 32 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I regularly clean my keyboard, phone, desk, etc. &amp;ndash; 30 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I avoid shaking hands with people &amp;ndash; 15 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I skip meetings where I know people are sick &amp;ndash; 3 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haefner offers the following tips for staying well at work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Don&amp;#39;t share your germs&lt;/b&gt;: If you are sick, do your best to keep your germs away from others by staying home. If you absolutely must come into the office, try to work in a conference room or away from others so you don&amp;#39;t spread your sickness. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Keep it balanced:&lt;/b&gt; With many workers facing heavier workloads and longer hours, some may be feeling maxed out. Be sure to manage your stress and stay healthy by taking a break during the day, exercising or even practicing yoga or meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Talk it out:&lt;/b&gt; If you are concerned about taking days off work when you are ill, talk to your manager or HR department so that you have a clear understanding on how your sick days can be used. Offer to telecommute, delegate or call-in if necessary, but ensure you get as much rest as possible so you are back on your feet.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Brady to offer online training on lockout/tagout compliance, visual workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This week, Brady Corporation announced the debut of its new eLearning training program, a series of Web-based training courses on workplace safety and productivity. Brady launched the eLearning platform with two comprehensive training modules: a lockout/tagout compliance program and a visual workplace program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At $29.95 per course, the lockout/tagout and visual workplace eLearning programs offers employers an affordable and convenient solution to meet the growing need for employee training &amp;ndash; without the cost of travel and days off of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interactive training courses aid learning with real-life scenarios, quizzes and reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Brady&amp;rsquo;s eLearning courses offer a number of interactive features to facilitate learning and comprehension, including real-life application situations and on-the-spot quizzes. With graphics, flash animation and hundreds of photographs from actual facilities, the courses provide tangible examples that participants can relate to in their existing job responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Designed as a self-directed learning experience, the eLearning courses are available 24 hours a day via the internet. Participants can save their course progress and come back to complete the training at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For managers, the courses also feature a number of convenient reporting options for monitoring the training progress of their employees. Managers can assign courses, send reminder emails and generate progress reports all within the eLearning platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockout training module provides instruction for a safe and compliant lockout program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As a leader in lockout/tagout compliance devices and services, Brady launched the lockout training program to round out its complete offering of lockout/tagout solutions. The Lockout/Tagout eLearning module is a two-part training program for all employees involved in lockout/tagout activities in a facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first course is specifically designed for authorized and affected workers, which are the employees who will actually be performing the servicing and maintenance activities on de-energized equipment. It provides a comprehensive review of how to safely perform lockout activities in line with OSHA requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second course is intended for corporate safety leaders, or the employees responsible for managing the lockout program. It reviews key learnings from the first course, and trains participants on the proper requirements for developing, implementing and sustaining a safe and compliant lockout/tagout program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual Workplace modules train employees to use visuals to sustain lean improvements &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Visual Workplace eLearning program consists of three individual training modules, each designed for lean managers and their employees. With a module on visual workplace, 5-S workplace organization and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), the program provides a comprehensive review of visual workplace techniques and best practices, and teaches employees how to sustain lean improvements by incorporating visuals into their existing 5-S and TPM activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the first module, &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Visual Workplace,&amp;rdquo; employees learn the fundamental concepts of a visually-instructive workplace and learn how to identify, create and maintain visuals throughout a facility based on visual management tools and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second module, &amp;ldquo;5S Visuals &amp;ndash; Improving Workplace Organization,&amp;rdquo; provides an overview of 5-S workplace organization and how visuals are used in 5-S to maintain order and optimize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final module is entitled &amp;ldquo;Visual Controls for TPM &amp;ndash; Enhancing Equipment Reliability and Maintenance Efficiency.&amp;rdquo; This course reviews the methods and goals of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and demonstrates how to use visuals in TPM to simplify maintenance and detect abnormalities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Standards covers safety through slip-resistant flooring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), in 2008 more than 8.5 million Americans sustained injuries from an unintentional slip or fall&amp;mdash;the leading cause of all nonfatal injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.nfsi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Floor Safety Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NFSI), a member and accredited standards developer of the &lt;a href="http://www.ansi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American National Standards Institute&lt;/a&gt;, 55 percent&amp;nbsp;of slips and falls are caused by a hazardous floor, but are preventable if slip-resistant flooring is in place. &lt;img align="right" border="1" hspace="7" src="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/images/News_Images/2771/floor.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recently released American National Standard (ANS) from NFSI aims to protect Americans from dangerous surfaces by providing test methods for flooring materials. &lt;a href="http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2fNFSI+B101.1-2009" target="_blank"&gt;ANSI/NFSI B101.1-2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Test Method for Measuring Wet SCOF of Common Hard-Surface Floor Materials&lt;/i&gt;, specifies the procedures and devices used for both laboratory and field testing to measure the wet static coefficient of friction (SCOF) of common hard-surface floor materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using ANSI/NFSI B101.1-2009, walkway slip resistance can be measured and categorized in one of three traction ranges: high, moderate, or low. Floors categorized as high-traction present a low risk of a slip and fall, while moderate- and low-traction floors present a higher risk. The standard does not apply to carpeting of any type or mechanically polished tile such as polished porcelain or marble, but does address common hard-surfaced flooring materials such as ceramic tile, vinyl floor coverings, and wood laminates, as well as coatings and polishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NFSI is a non-profit organization representing product manufacturers, insurance underwriters, trade associations, and independent consultants that work to aid in the prevention of slips, trips, and falls through education, research, and standards development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/jhnaU0P9DvU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Guidance on permit-required confined spaces</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s standard on &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=35&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;permit-required confined spaces (PRCS)&lt;/a&gt; says entry occurs as soon as any part of the entrant&amp;#39;s body breaks the plane of the opening into the permit space. As clarified in an &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=39&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;OSHA Letter of Interpretation (LOI) dated October 18, 1995&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;When any part of the body of an entrant breaks the plane of the opening of a PRCS large enough to allow full entry, entry is considered to have occurred and a permit is required, regardless of whether there is an intent to fully enter the space.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An OSHA LOI clarifies that there are situations where a partial entry would be hazardous: &amp;quot;Examples of situations where entry by only part of the body into a &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=28&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;PRCS&lt;/a&gt; can expose an entrant to the possibility of injury or illness are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An entrant can possibly suffer a burn while reaching into a PRCS, which is so classified because it contains a thermal hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An entrant can possibly fall into a below grade PRCS while standing on a vertical ladder in the opening of the space, which is so classified because it contains an oxygen deficient atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An entrant can possibly become unconscious as result of his head accidentally entering a PRCS while they are reaching into a PRCS, which is so classified because it contains an oxygen deficient atmosphere.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OSHA says examples of situations where entry by only part of the body into a &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=29&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;PRCS&lt;/a&gt; would not expose an entrant to the possibility of injury or illness are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An entrant reaches through the opening of a horizontal PRCS, which is so classified only because it contains exposed live electrical parts ten feet from the opening.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An entrant put his head through the opening of an overhead PRCS, which is so classified only because it contains unguarded rotating parts ten feet from the opening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also consider a situation such as a worker reaching through a small grate to take a sample from a permit space. The LOI further states, &amp;quot;If a part of the body were placed in an opening through which the worker could not pass into the permit-required confined space, no &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=27&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;PRCS&lt;/a&gt; entry will have occurred.&amp;quot; Keep in mind, however, that the employee would still need protection from any hazards involved in the task, but a permit would not be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confined Spaces on KOL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Keller&lt;em&gt;Online&lt;/em&gt; can help to answer all of your confined space questions by providing access to OSHA regulations and letters of interpretation. Within the &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=12&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;Confined Spaces&lt;/a&gt; topic in the &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=21&amp;amp;m=36182224&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTIzNzIwNzgS1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;Topic Index&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll find a definition of exactly what OSHA considered to be a permit-required confined space, and also OSHA&amp;#39;s training and entry requirements for those spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KOL can provide citations to the regulations and guidance documents that may apply to your operations. For instance, you can reclassify a permit space as a non-permit confined space if there are no actual or potential atmospheric hazards and if all other hazards within the space are eliminated without entry into the space, under Paragraph (c)(7)(i) of the final rule. The reclassification would be valid as long as the non-atmospheric hazards remain eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Steel, Power Piping cited for energy control hazards following July 2010 explosion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited U.S. Steel Corporation and Power Piping Company with safety citations for failing to provide an effective energy control procedure and exposing workers to burns following an explosion at U.S. Steel&amp;#39;s Clairton Works facility in Clairton, Pa.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA initiated an investigation in July 2010 after being notified that workers from both companies suffered first, second and third-degree burns, as well as other serious injuries. As a result of the investigation, OSHA cited U.S. Steel for two willful and 11 serious violations, with a total penalty of $143,500.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Power Piping Co., which was contracted by U.S. Steel to provide steam fitting services at the site, was cited for six serious violations, with $31,500 in penalties.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;U.S. Steel and Power Piping did not have the proper controls in place to prevent worker exposure to hazardous energy,&amp;quot; said Robert Szymanski, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s Area Office. &amp;quot;These violations must be abated immediately to prevent future incidents.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The alleged willful violations for U.S. Steel involve the company&amp;#39;s failure to provide an effective energy control procedure. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	That company&amp;#39;s alleged serious violations include a lack of fall protection, inadequate lockout/tagout to prevent the inadvertent release of energy, a deficient process safety management program, and failure to implement an emergency response plan, evaluate respiratory hazards, use flame retardant gloves and use approved electrical equipment. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Power Piping&amp;#39;s alleged serious violations include inadequate energy control procedures, a lack of flame-retardant hand protection and the company&amp;#39;s failure to evaluate the respiratory hazards posed by coke oven gases.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The companies have 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, ask for an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/d-vbkaniHSY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>MSHA report shows mining deaths rose in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mining fatalities in the United States significantly increased in 2010, following a year marked by the fewest deaths in mining history, according to the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration. Seventy-one miners died on the job last year, compared to 34 in 2009. Forty-eight of those deaths occurred in coal mines, and 23 occurred at metal and nonmetal operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the 71 mining fatalities reported, 23 of those victims were killed in surface mining accidents, while 48 miners died in underground mining accidents, 29 of whom were killed in the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in April. The leading cause of coal mining deaths was ignition or explosion, followed by powered haulage and roof falls. The leading cause of metal/nonmetal mining deaths was powered haulage, followed by falling or sliding material, and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While 2010 will be remembered for the explosion that killed 29 men at the Upper Big Branch mine, we are mindful that 42 additional miners&amp;#39; lives also ended in tragedy,&amp;quot; said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. &amp;quot;Increasing our efforts to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our nation&amp;#39;s miners is the best way to honor the memory of those who died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;First and foremost, mine operators must take responsibility for the health and safety conditions in their mines to prevent these tragedies,&amp;quot; Main added. &amp;quot;Mining deaths are preventable, and actions must be undertaken to prevent them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MSHA has taken a number of actions to identify mines with safety issues, and has initiated a number of outreach and enforcement initiatives, including &amp;quot;Rules to Live By,&amp;quot; a fatality prevention program spotlighting the safety and health standards most frequently cited during fatal accident investigations. That information is available on the MSHA website at &lt;a href="http://www.msha.gov/focuson/rulestoliveby.asp"&gt;http://www.msha.gov/focuson/rulestoliveby.asp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, MSHA engaged in a number of targeted enforcement, awareness, outreach and rulemaking activities in 2010 to reduce the number of mining fatalities, accidents and illnesses. These efforts include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A monthly round of aggressively targeted impact inspections at mines with a history of significant and/or repeat violations, poor compliance records, and high numbers of closure orders, accidents, injuries, illnesses or fatalities. Between April and December 2010, MSHA conducted 200 impact inspections and issued 4,142 citations, orders and safeguards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New screening criteria and tougher procedures for the pattern of violations enforcement program, which gives the agency additional enforcement tools to use at mines with a history of violating safety standards, and notification of 14 mines for potential pattern of violations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		First-time use under the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to seek injunctive action against the most recalcitrant mine operators, resulting in a settlement requiring specific safety measures to be applied to the mine.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New enforcement policies and alert bulletins addressing specific hazards or problems such as prohibitions on advanced notice of MSHA inspections, mine ventilation requirements to prevent mine explosions, and miners&amp;#39; rights to report hazards without being subject to retaliation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A roof fall prevention awareness program aimed at reducing the high number of roof falls that occur in the nation&amp;#39;s underground coal mines&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A pilot program aimed at addressing the backlog of contested citations and the agency&amp;#39;s conferencing procedures at the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Issuance of a new emergency temporary standard for rock dust, which would strengthen miners&amp;#39; protections and minimize the potential for coal dust explosions by requiring a higher percentage of inert rock dust in underground coal mines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A safety initiative calling special attention to the potential dangers that shuttle cars and scoops pose in underground coal mines pose to miners, a leading cause of miner injury and death.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A new, proposed rule that would expand requirements at underground coal mines requiring mine operators to conduct pre-shift, supplemental, on-shift and weekly examinations to determine compliance with mandatory health and safety standards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A two-part, comprehensive action plan to tackle black lung, which encompassed &lt;em&gt;education, enhanced enforcement, training and rulemaking,&lt;/em&gt; including publication of a proposed rule on lowering miners&amp;#39; exposure to respirable coal dust to end black lung disease among miners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;No miners should have to die on the job just to earn a paycheck,&amp;quot; said Main. &amp;quot;MSHA will vigorously enforce the Mine Act, and look for ways to improve our policies and regulations to prevent these unnecessary deaths and provide miners the opportunity to return home safe at the end of every shift,&amp;quot; said Main.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/bt-n48L64dw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bridgford Foods Processing fined $212,000 for endangering workers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued the Bridgford Foods Processing Corporation facility in Chicago 10 safety citations for failing to implement and provide training for workers on lockout/tagout procedures, thereby exposing them to energized equipment. The meat processing plant is facing proposed penalties of $212,000.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;By failing to train employees and enforce lockout/tagout procedures, Bridgford Foods placed employees in danger of serious injury from equipment that was not properly de-energized,&amp;quot; said Gary Anderson, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Calumet City, Ill. &amp;quot;OSHA is committed to ensuring that workers are provided a safe and healthful workplace.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a result of a July 2010 OSHA inspection, Bridgford Foods Processing has been issued one willful citation, with a proposed penalty of $70,000, for allowing workers to remove a shovel stuck in an auger screw conveyor without locking or tagging out the auger, placing employees in danger of the machine operating while they worked to remove the shovel. A willful violation exists when an employer has demonstrated either an intentional disregard for the requirements of the law or plain indifference to employee safety and health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Bridgford Foods Processing also has been issued six repeat citations, with proposed fines of $135,000, for having locked exit doors, failing to provide lockout/tagout or electrical safety training, failing to provide a load backrest extension on a powered industrial truck to minimize the hazard of material falling and failing to specifically outline energy control procedures. OSHA issues a repeat citation when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Additionally, two serious citations have been issued for failing to perform periodic energy control inspections and to maintain unobstructed exit routes. Those citations carry penalties of $7,000. An OSHA violation is serious when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One other-than-serious citation has been issued for failing to properly illuminate exit signs. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Bridgford Foods&amp;#39; Chicago facility has been inspected by OSHA three times since November 2007, resulting in 29 health and safety citations. The company is headquartered in Anaheim, Calif., and also operates two factories in Dallas and one in Statesville, N.C.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This investigation falls under the requirements of OSHA&amp;#39;s Severe Violators Enforcement Program. Initiated in the spring of 2010, SVEP focuses on recalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations in one or more of the following circumstances: a fatality or catastrophe, industry operations or processes that expose workers to severe occupational hazards, employee exposure to hazards related to the potential releases of highly hazardous chemicals and all egregious enforcement actions. For more information on SVEP, go to &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf" title="Severe Violator Enforcement Program(SVEP)"&gt;http://www.osha.gov/dep/svep-directive.pdf&lt;/a&gt;*.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The company has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/0gwK28yDT_8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA cites Louisiana chemical plant with 14 workplace safety and health violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Georgia Gulf Chemicals &amp;amp; Vinyls LLC with 14 serious violations for exposing workers to multiple safety and health hazards at the company&amp;#39;s facility in Plaquemine, La. Proposed penalties total $55,000.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;An employer&amp;#39;s greatest resource is its workers, and exposing them to preventable injuries and illnesses will not be tolerated,&amp;quot; said Dorinda Folse, director of OSHA&amp;#39;s Baton Rouge Area Office in Louisiana. &amp;quot;The Occupational Safety and Health Act is designed to ensure that workers have a safe workplace.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s Baton Rouge Area Office initiated its investigation on July 20 after an OSHA inspector observed violations by Georgia Gulf Chemicals employees while conducting an investigation of a different company contracted to do maintenance work inside the same Plaquemine facility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The violations include failing to illuminate exit routes, ensure vessels were inspected on a regular basis, train workers performing preventive maintenance on safety critical instruments, and ensure eyewashes had adequate flow and capped nozzles. A serious violation is one in which there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Georgia Gulf Chemicals &amp;amp; Vinyls LLC, headquartered in Atlanta, Ga., employs approximately 2,000 workers company-wide, including about 600 located at the Plaquemine facility. The company also has operations in Texas and Mississippi.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The company, which specializes in the production of chlorine, caustic soda, vinyl chloride monomer, vinyl resins, phenol and acetone, has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Baton Rouge or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/YHNo0KEEA3Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Federal judge hands down preliminary injunction against Rosebud Mining Company</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration on January 11 announced that a federal judge with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania has issued a preliminary injunction against Rosebud Mining Co. In a federal lawsuit filed on December 30, 2010, MSHA claimed that personnel at the company&amp;#39;s Mine 78 in Somerset County, Pa., and Tracy Lynne Mine in Armstrong County, Pa., provided advance notice of federal inspectors&amp;#39; arrival, which violates Section 103(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During special impact inspections conducted Aug. 12 and Nov. 4, 2010, mine personnel were warned against giving advance notice that an inspection party was present on mine property. MSHA personnel immediately captured the phone systems at both operations to assure compliance. However, those instructions were ignored at both operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Mine employees understand that advance notification is illegal,&amp;quot; said Solicitor of Labor M. Patricia Smith. &amp;quot;The fact that workers at these two mines were cautioned against warning their colleagues underground of the presence of federal inspectors, yet did so anyway, shows a total disregard for the law.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A preliminary injunction hearing was held on January 7. On January 10, Judge Kim R. Gibson issued an order enjoining Rosebud Mining Company from giving advance notice to any person working underground at these mines that a federal mine inspector is on site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The judge also noted that the court will hold a status conference on this matter at intervals of approximately 60 days to ensure that the injunction is being enforced. The initial status conference is scheduled for March 1, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/N7TdIuL3t9E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Del Monte Foods lauded for commitment to employee health and wellness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In recognition of its commitment to employee health and wellness, Del Monte Foods has attained the prestigious Platinum Fit-Friendly status in the American Heart Association&amp;#39;s Start! Fit-Friendly Companies program for the second consecutive year. The program recognizes companies that champion the health of their employees and work to create a culture of physical activity in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Del Monte&amp;#39;s participation in the American Heart Association&amp;#39;s Fit-Friendly program is a reflection of our continued commitment to our employees&amp;#39; health and wellness,&amp;quot; said Richard G. Wolford, Del Monte Foods chairman and CEO. &amp;quot;We are committed to our wellness program&amp;#39;s growth and continue to expand the offerings every year. Here at Del Monte, we know that a healthy, active lifestyle is our best weapon against health ailments; after all, research shows that for every hour of regular exercise people get, they can gain about two hours of additional life expectancy. Del Monte Foods is proud to be part of the American Heart Association&amp;#39;s Start! Movement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Platinum Fit-Friendly companies are recognized for implementing programs and activities that encourage, among other wellness initiatives, physical activity, nutrition and culture enhancements, and preventative health measures. Companies that meet at least nine criteria outlined by the American Heart Association may be considered for this highest level of recognition in the Start! Fit-Friendly Companies program.

            <title>Making sense of electrical measurement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Today, it&amp;rsquo;s all about making the customer happy, right? Or, wait, is it all about making the boss happy. Or, getting your money&amp;rsquo;s worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to making sense of what the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; test tool is, there really are multiple factors to consider &amp;ndash; customer satisfaction, safety and dollar savings being just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take clamp meters. A clamp meter is an electrical tester that combines a voltmeter with a clamp-type current meter. Way back when (or maybe not so long ago), they were created as a single-purpose test tool for electricians. But today&amp;rsquo;s models have incorporated more measurement functions, more accuracy and, in some instruments, some special measurement features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all know it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider the specifications and features of a clamp meter, to make sure you get what you need for the job. For instance, some people really want a tool that performs very specific functions, and so, there are different clamps for different uses. And, not everyone wants a top of the line device. Some people really want the quality, durability and accuracy of a trusted brand, but they don&amp;rsquo;t need bells and whistles. And other people, they want whistles &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bells. The key here, if you&amp;rsquo;re seeing the trend, is options. That said, there are some pretty fantastic features that should be kept top of mind when reviewing today&amp;rsquo;s newest clamp meters, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Those that run up to 2,500 amps AC / 1,000 amps DC.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A clamp that can fit into tight, crowded panels and around big conductors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Wireless options: It&amp;rsquo;s ideal to be able to connect the clamp, detach the readout and walk away. No one should be running back and forth anymore. And, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need a second person.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		State-of-the-art signal processing: You should always get stable readings, even in noisy electrical environments. This technology should be standard in any test tool you buy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Multi-dimensional: Your clamp should be able to work with accessories to measure pressure, temperature and fiber optics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clamp meters really are the way to go in a wide range of measurement scenarios, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re working with higher amperages &amp;ndash; or if you need a comprehensive motor test in one device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep the above features in mind when considering clamp meters and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that it is possible to do good work, be safe and feel pretty good about your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But for all that talk about features and specs, sometimes what it comes down to are the non-tangibles, like how a tool fits in your hand or your tool belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many meters out there, and Fluke has just introduced a new &lt;a href="http://us.fluke.com/fluke/usen/electrical-test-tools/clamp-meters/fluke-381.htm?PID=70413"&gt;true-rms clamp meter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;series that is definitely worth checking out. You can really move the bar with these devices. Or move the meter, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/Yb5w2COTrak" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA cites MillerCoors following investigation into ammonia release</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited MillerCoors LLC of Golden, Colo., with 10 alleged serious violations of OSHA standards following the July 2010 release in excess of 2000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at its Golden brewery. Proposed fines total $63,500.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s investigation found that two employees working on the ammonia system narrowly escaped serious injury when an uncontrolled release occurred during maintenance operations. Anhydrous ammonia is severely corrosive to skin, eyes and the respiratory system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Employers must be diligent in ensuring that employees and the public are not unwittingly exposed to serious hazards caused by inadequate maintenance of systems controlling highly hazardous chemicals,&amp;quot; said John Healy, OSHA&amp;#39;s area office director in Englewood, Colo. &amp;quot;There is no acceptable reason for any employer to require employees to work around such a dangerous chemical without first ensuring they can do so without compromising their safety and health.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The serious citations address failing to follow accepted preventive maintenance procedures required under OSHA&amp;#39;s process safety management standard, failing to develop and implement proper lockout/tagout procedures for energy sources, and deficiencies in the emergency eyewash and respirator programs. An OSHA violation is serious when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	MillerCoors has 15 business days from receipt of all OSHA citations to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/cLL1C4rvMhE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tips for workers in cold weather</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	J.J. Keller &amp;amp; Associates offers these tips for workers in cold weather:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wear adequate personal protective clothing. &lt;/strong&gt;Three layers of clothing is recommended: an outer layer to act as a windbreaker, made of water-resistant material such as Gortex&amp;reg; or nylon; a middle layer of wool or synthetic fabric to absorb sweat and retain insulation; and an inner layer which promotes wicking of sweat and ventilation. Employees should keep a change of clothes on hand in case clothes become wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Protect the feet and head. &lt;/strong&gt;Up to 40 percent of body heat can be lost when the head is exposed. Footgear should be insulated to protect against cold and dampness. A mid-day change of socks can help keep feet warm. Use chemical heat packs for hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Implement engineering controls. &lt;/strong&gt;Use an onsite heat source such as air jets or radiant heaters or shield work areas from drafty or windy conditions. Provide a heated shelter for employees who experience prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures or wind chills. Use thermal insulating material on equipment handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Alter work schedules. &lt;/strong&gt;Allow a period of adjustment to the cold before beginning a full work schedule. Reduce the number of activities performed outdoors as much as possible. Have employees work in the cold during the warmest hours of the day. Alternate indoor and outdoor work if possible and have employees work in pairs or in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Permit employees to take warm-up breaks. &lt;/strong&gt;Allow employees to take breaks as needed to keep warm. Encourage employees to stay hydrated, but it is best to avoid caffeinated beverages, which can inhibit the body&amp;#39;s response to the cold. Have warm fluids on hand such as decaffeinated coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Final tip: Provide training on signs of cold-related stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Be sure employees know the warning signs and symptoms of hypothermia, frostbite, and trench foot if the work involves standing in wet or damp areas. Be sure they know what to do and what not to, in case a coworker exhibits these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KOL Can Help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Check out the &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=45&amp;amp;m=36159513&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;Temperature extremes&lt;/a&gt; topic for information on working in cold climates. Cold weather workers need to consume more calories and drink plenty of water &amp;ndash; the body requires both to create heat. Select the warmest part of the day to perform activities. Provide training on the symptoms of cold stress and to use the buddy system so that they can keep an eye on one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another topic, &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=8&amp;amp;m=36159513&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;Cold stress equation&lt;/a&gt;, shows the relationship between low temperatures, wetness, and wind speed and hypothermia. There is also a link in that topic to an OSHA letter of interpretation on &lt;a href="http://links.e.jjkelleronline.com/ctt?kn=35&amp;amp;m=36159513&amp;amp;r=MjA4ODQ0MDkyMQS2&amp;amp;b=0&amp;amp;j=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;mt=2&amp;amp;rj=OTE4MTcxMzES1&amp;amp;rt=0" target="_blank"&gt;hand protection for cold environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Labor Department, Massey Energy reach settlement agreement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration and Massey Energy reached a settlement agreement January 5 in a case involving Freedom Energy Mining Company&amp;#39;s Mine No. 1 located in Pike County, Ky. Last November, MSHA filed in federal court a motion for preliminary injunction against the mine, the first such action ever taken by the agency. Section 108(a)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 provides for injunctive relief against non-compliant mine operators who habitually violate health and safety standards. Shortly thereafter, Massey announced plans to idle the mine permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Today&amp;#39;s agreement is a legal victory not only for the Department of Labor but for all miners employed by Freedom Energy,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;Its powerful provisions allow MSHA to withdraw miners immediately over a broad range of hazardous conditions, and health and safety violations. More than ever, these types of actions are forcing mine operators to take a hard look at their safety practices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The order, signed by Judge Amul R. Thapar of the U.S. District Court Eastern District of Kentucky, requires Freedom Energy to take certain actions to comply with a recovery plan that will ensure the health and safety of miners who continue to work at the mine as they dismantle and remove mine equipment in preparation for permanent closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the immediate withdrawal provisions, Freedom Energy must provide timetables for activities involving removal of all mining equipment. The highest level management official, including the mine superintendent, must be available at the mine during each working shift to review and countersign the results of each pre-shift, on-shift and weekly examination performed by a certified mine examiner. Miners idled as a result of any withdrawal covered by this order must receive pay for the period during which they were idled up to one week. For periods longer than one week, the company must offer alternate equivalent work within a 60-mile radius of the mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All requirements of the order are subject to the court&amp;#39;s contempt proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/P0FHOVTIj70" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota Industrial Equipment plant achieves safety milestone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Material Handling USA Inc. (TMHU) on January 5 announced that the Quality Assurance department at Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing Inc. (TIEM) in Columbus, Ind., the manufacturer of the No. 1-selling lift truck in the U.S., has achieved 200,000 consecutive hours worked without a recordable accident according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The 200,000 hours represents 1,000 work days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Toyota, safety is the top priority,&amp;rdquo; said Kazue Sasaki, president of TIEM and chairman of Toyota Material Handling North America. &amp;ldquo;This remarkable safety achievement was accomplished through the hard work of all Quality Assurance associates and their leadership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety and Quality Top Priority at TIEM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Toyota&amp;rsquo;s high standard of manufacturing excellence, which emphasizes safety and quality is reinforced daily with all associates and management teams. As part of the program, TIEM works to incorporate safety awareness and risk reduction into all plant activities associated with the manufacture of Toyota lift trucks and replacement parts for industrial lift trucks and tow tractors, along with the assembly of motor vehicle parts and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forklift manufacturing is unique from other industrial equipment due to the weight of components. An average size forklift weighs three times more than an automobile. As such, TIEM put into place a number of safety programs to address ergonomic and hazardous challenges. For example, TIEM created a safety &amp;ldquo;dojo,&amp;rdquo; or training area, on the shop floor. Associates learn safety awareness and practices with a hands-on approach in these areas. There are more than a dozen &amp;ldquo;dojo&amp;rdquo; workstations that address a wide range of risk assessments from fire evacuation to hoist and crane safety to tool inspection and ergonomics and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the year, TIEM management and associates are required to attend annual &amp;ldquo;dojo&amp;rdquo; training, risk assessment training, and monthly training sessions. These programs have attributed to TIEM being honored for its safety systems and performance record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/uK8nAEOV80g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Study looks at enhancing food safety culture to reduce foodborne illness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If providing safe food is a priority, why do large outbreaks of foodborne illness keep happening? Incidents like 2010&amp;#39;s salmonella-in-eggs outbreak sickened more than 1,900 across the U.S. and led to the recall of 500 million eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new study by a Kansas State University professor and colleagues finds how the culture of food safety is practiced within an organization can be a significant risk factor in foodborne illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doug Powell, associate professor of food safety at K-State, said how businesses and organizations operate above and beyond minimal food safety regulations and inspections, or their food safety culture, is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;d think making customers sick is bad for business, yet some firms go out of their way to ignore food safety,&amp;quot; Powell said. &amp;quot;Some places are motivated by money and efficiencies. The amount of regulation, inspection and audits just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter. And those &amp;#39;Employees Must Wash Hands&amp;#39; signs don&amp;#39;t really work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powell, along with Casey Jacob, a former K-State research assistant, and Ben Chapman, an assistant professor at North Carolina State University, examined three food safety failures: an E. coli O157:H7 outbreak in Wales in 2005 that sickened 157 and killed one; a listeria outbreak in Canada in 2008 that sickened 57 and killed 23; and a salmonella outbreak in the U.S. in 2009 linked to peanut paste that killed nine and sickened 691.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their study &amp;quot;Enhancing Food Safety Culture to Reduce Rates of Foodborne Illness&amp;quot; is being published by the journal Food Control and is available in advance online at &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/hDh9EE"&gt;http://bit.ly/hDh9EE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Creating a culture of food safety requires application of the best science with the best management and communication systems,&amp;quot; Chapman said. &amp;quot;Operators should know the risks associated with their products, how to manage them, and most important, how to communicate with and compel their staff to employ good practices -- it&amp;#39;s a package deal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the researchers, individuals focusing on food safety risks within an organization with a good food safety culture do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know the risks associated with the foods they handle and how those should be managed;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dedicate resources to evaluate supplier practices;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stay up-to-date on emerging food safety issues;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Foster a value system within the organization that focuses on avoiding illnesses;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate compelling and relevant messages about risk reduction activities, and empower others to put them into practice;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Promote effective food safety systems before an incident occurs; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;#39;t blame customers, including commercial buyers and consumers, when illnesses are linked to their products.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>NSC represented on National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety &amp; Health</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The National Safety Council is proud to announce that James Johnson, group vice president of workplace safety initiatives, has been appointed by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis to serve a two-year term on the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety &amp;amp; Health. Johnson is one of five new members to the 12-person advisory committee, chosen for his experience and knowledge in occupational safety and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/dop/nacosh/nacosh.html" target="_blank" title=""&gt;NACOSH&lt;/a&gt;, established under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, provides recommendations and advises the secretaries of labor and health and human services on occupational safety and health programs and policies. The secretaries may consult with NACOSH on priorities such as leadership, enforcement, compliance, research and expanded partnerships. The secretaries also may reach out to NACOSH for insight on emerging issues in safety and health that OSHA and HHS might choose to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The new NACOSH members possess a wealth of knowledge and real-world experience on a wide range of worker health and safety matters,&amp;rdquo; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Johnson will be one of two members representing management. &amp;ldquo;I am honored to be selected and to have the opportunity to contribute with the other distinguished members on the committee,&amp;rdquo; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to joining the Council in August 2009, Johnson had more than 30 years of experience as a safety and health consultant, project manager and team manager, leading the development and delivery of progressive safety solutions for companies of all sizes and in all industries. Johnson previously managed operations and multiple risk control disciplines at companies including Liberty Mutual Group, Johnson &amp;amp; Higgins and Marsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Johnson holds a bachelor of science degree from Stanford University. A past member of the NSC board of directors, he also is a professional member of the American Society of Safety Engineers and past president of its Boston Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The National Safety Council (&lt;a href="http://nsc.org/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;www.nsc.org&lt;/a&gt;) saves lives by preventing injuries and deaths at work, in homes and communities, and on the roads through leadership, research, education and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/mtvkozqh8Uk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA proposes $238,000 in fines against USPS mail processing facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the U.S. Postal Service for willful and serious violations of safety standards following an inspection at the Central Massachusetts Processing and Distribution Center in Shrewsbury, Mass. The Postal Service faces a total of $238,000 in fines, chiefly for exposing workers to electrical hazards.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;These sizable fines reflect the Postal Service&amp;#39;s knowledge of and failure to address these hazards,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;For years, the Postal Service knew that allowing untrained employees to work on electrical equipment exposed workers to serious injury or worse. Despite this knowledge, the Postal Service did not take the necessary steps to change its practices and eliminate the hazards.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s inspection, which began June 29 in response to a worker complaint, found that unqualified employees at the Shrewsbury location were allowed to work on and test energized electrical circuits and equipment. In addition, electrical equipment had not been de-energized prior to maintenance being performed, and employees were not supplied with insulated tools and equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	These conditions resulted in the issuance of three willful citations, with $210,000 in proposed fines. OSHA defines a willful violation as one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law&amp;#39;s requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA also issued the Postal Service four serious citations, with $28,000 in fines, for lack of employee training in safety-related electrical work practices, lack of personal protective equipment, inadequate voltage meters and failing to perform periodic inspections of the Shrewsbury facility&amp;#39;s energy control procedures. OSHA issues serious citations when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Postal Service has 15 business days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to comply, meet with the OSHA area director or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor has filed an enterprise-wide complaint against the U.S. Postal Service for electrical work safety violations. The complaint asks the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission to order the USPS to correct electrical violations at all its facilities nationwide. This complaint marks the first time OSHA has sought enterprise-wide relief as a remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/JXYLZX-tiQ0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>OSHA cites LM Wind Power Blades following worker fatality investigation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited LM Wind Power Blades Inc. of Grand Forks, N.D., with five safety violations for exposing workers to fall and crushing hazards that ultimately took one worker&amp;#39;s life.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	OSHA&amp;#39;s Bismarck Area Office began an investigation in July following the death of an employee working from a scissor lift who was crushed by a nearby crane. The employer is being cited with one willful, three serious and one other-than-serious citation. Formerly known as LM Glasfiber Inc., the company manufactures wind turbine blades.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;A worker&amp;#39;s life was needlessly lost because the employer failed to identify and eliminate the hazards prior to allowing this employee to perform the work,&amp;quot; said Tom Deutscher, OSHA&amp;#39;s area office director in Bismarck. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s critical for employers to assess conditions before letting work begin.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The alleged willful violation is for failing to ensure employees were adequately protected against struck-by and/or crushing hazards from a nearby crane OSHA defines a willful violation as one committed with intentional knowing or voluntary disregard for the law&amp;#39;s requirements, or plain indifference to worker safety and health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The three serious violations involve failing to use a body belt while on an aerial lift, climbing the guardrails of a scissor lift without fall protection and failing to safely position cranes for maintenance operations. A serious citation is issued when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The other-than-serious violation is for failing to provide adequate warning or &amp;quot;out-of-order&amp;quot; signs. An other-than-serious violation is one that has a relationship to job safety and health but would not directly cause death or serious physical harm.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Proposed penalties total $92,000. LM Wind Power Blades has 15 business days from receipt of the citations to contest them before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Prior to contesting, they may request an informal conference with OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Bismarck. To report workplace accidents, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, call OSHA&amp;#39;s toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/E9spo-Sgoy8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>NHCA defends OSHAâs decision to change interpretation of noise control enforcement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA) is reiterating its support for the change in workplace noise control enforcement announced on October 19, 2010 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). A number of concerns about this announced change have been raised by employers and industry groups. Unfortunately, it appears that many of these concerns may be based on misunderstandings regarding the proposed change. NHCA seeks to underscore the importance of OSHA&amp;rsquo;s proposed interpretation for American workers, and to address a number of misperceptions related to this interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NHCA endorses OSHA&amp;rsquo;s decision to revise the current lenient enforcement policy concerning noise controls. This policy &amp;ndash; established more than 25 years ago in the absence of rulemaking or public input &amp;ndash; does not require employers to implement feasible engineering and administrative noise controls until workers&amp;rsquo; eight-hour average exposures reach 100 dBA or greater, which is 10 times more intensethan the current Permissible Exposure Limit of 90 dBA. The current policy has made noise the only regulated health hazard in which OSHA has failed to acknowledge the primacy of engineering controls, and has resulted in a substantial increase in risk of hearing loss for some American workers. The alternative exposure reduction method currently allowed by OSHA for eight-hour average exposures between 90 and 100 dBA is the use of earplugs or earmuffs, which have been demonstrated to provide insufficient protection for many workers, if they are used at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We see OSHA&amp;rsquo;s proposed change as a policy &lt;em&gt;correction. &lt;/em&gt;That is, it does not represent the creation of a new regulation or a new policy. Rather, it represents a return to the original intent of OSHA&amp;rsquo;s noise regulation, which is to institute engineering or administrative controls for employees with eight-hour average exposures over 90 dBA. OSHA&amp;rsquo;s proposed definition of the word feasible (i.e., &amp;ldquo;capable of being done&amp;rdquo;) will make requirements for controls consistent with OSHA&amp;rsquo;s other health regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Opponents of this policy correction have raised a number of objections. In the paragraphs below, NHCA seeks to address the misperceptions on which four of these objections are based:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The change proposed by OSHA is an attempt to alter an exposure limit outside of the rulemaking process. &lt;/em&gt;This proposed change will simply allow OSHA to enforce the original language and intent of the noise regulation. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that there&amp;rsquo;s such an outcry about this proposed change now,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Neitzel, PhD, CIH, immediate past president of NHCA. &amp;ldquo;The real outcry should have happened 26 years ago when OSHA first established a noise control enforcement policy that was legally questionable and that effectively gutted what would otherwise have been an important occupational health protection for American workers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;All employers whose facilities have any areas with noise levelsover 90 dBA will have to implement noise controls. &lt;/em&gt;The need for noise controls is determined by &lt;em&gt;eight-hour average &lt;/em&gt;exposures over 90 dBA, not noise &lt;em&gt;levels &lt;/em&gt;over 90 dBA. This means that far fewer workers will be subject to the control requirements than if only noise &lt;em&gt;levels &lt;/em&gt;were measured. Workplaces can have areas with noise levels over 90 dBA &amp;ndash; even levels up to 115 dBA, depending on the length of workers&amp;rsquo; exposures &amp;ndash; and still be in compliance with OSHA&amp;rsquo;s proposed policy correction. The noise control requirement is only triggered when workers have eight-hour average exposures over 90 dBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The change proposed by OSHA will have a broad and substantial economic impact that will eliminate jobs and reduce competitiveness. &lt;/em&gt;OSHA estimated that in 1981 about 19 percent of U.S. manufacturing workers had eight hour average exposures above 90 dBA. This percentage is undoubtedly lower today because of outsourcing, automation, and other factors. Professionals in industrial hygiene and noise control engineering now estimate that about 10 percent of workers enrolled in hearing conservation programs are exposed to eight-hour average exposures greater than 90 dBA. These are the workers to which the new policy applies. The vast majority of US workplaces will not be affected by the proposed policy correction, though there are some industries with a higher percentage of overexposed workers. &amp;ldquo;Those companies that are affected by the proposed change are probably experiencing ongoing problems with noise-induced hearing loss, and will benefit in the long run from exposure reduction through noise controls&amp;rdquo; said Neitzel. In addition, noise controls, which are often thought to be difficult to develop and complex to implement, can also be an inexpensive and expedient means of achieving compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The change in policy isn&amp;rsquo;t needed because hearing conservation programs are working and hearing protectors are effective. &lt;/em&gt;Studies have shown that workers continue to lose their hearing in spite of the presence of hearing conservation programs. This is because many of these programs rely on workers&amp;rsquo; use of hearing protectors rather than noise controls. Hearing protectors are often resisted by workers, are commonly worn for insufficient durations, and fail to provide the expected noise reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The mission of the NHCA is to prevent hearing loss due to noise and other environmental factors in all sectors of society. NHCA&amp;#39;s membership includes audiologists, researchers, industrial hygienists, physicians and occupational health nurses, educators, professional service organizations, safety professionals, engineers, audio professionals, students, and others who have dedicated their work to the advancement of hearing loss prevention.

            <title>MSHA announces results of November impact inspections</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Mine Safety and Health Administration on December 21 announced that federal inspectors issued 250 citations, orders and safeguards during special impact inspections conducted at 12 coal and 10 metal/nonmetal mine operations last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These inspections, which began in force during April following the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine, involve mines that merit increased agency attention and enforcement due to their poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns, including high numbers of violations or closure orders; indications of operator tactics, such as advance notification of inspections that prevent inspectors from observing violations; frequent hazard complaints or hotline calls; plan compliance issues; inadequate workplace examinations; a high number of accidents, injuries or illnesses; fatalities; and adverse conditions such as increased methane liberation, faulty roof conditions and inadequate ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During November&amp;#39;s impact inspections, coal mines were issued 114 citations, 11 orders and one safeguard. For metal/nonmetal mines, 113 citations and 11 orders were issued. Since April, MSHA has conducted impact inspections at 182 coal and metal/nonmetal mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During an inspection conducted during the week of Nov. 15 at Lehigh Permanente Cement Co. Mine in Santa Clara County, Calif., MSHA issued 30 citations and six orders to the company. Five 104(d) orders were issued, including a violation for a supervisor&amp;#39;s failure to de-energize electrically powered equipment prior to removing a guard. Another 104(d) order was issued for unsafe access where inadequately secured steel plates could have fallen on miners or delivery drivers accessing a storage area; this hazard had been reported to mine management two weeks earlier. A 104(b) order was issued for failure-to-abate in a timely manner a fall protection violation, in which miners working at the top of a mill were exposed to an approximately 36-foot drop to the concrete below. Sixty percent of the citations and orders were significant and substantial violations. So far this year, MSHA inspectors have issued 185 citations and 21 orders at this mine.&lt;/p&gt;

	&amp;quot;MSHA&amp;#39;s impact inspection program is helping to reduce the number of mines that consider egregious violation records a cost of doing business,&amp;quot; said Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health. &amp;quot;We will continue using this important enforcement tool to protect the nation&amp;#39;s miners.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tips on how to stay safe and healthy while shoveling snow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Snowstorms are a time of excitement and wonder for a child: snowball fights, sledding and closed schools. For adults, it&amp;rsquo;s the dreaded shoveling season complete with aching backs, frozen fingers or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Each year thousands of people are treated in emergency departments across the United States for heart attacks, broken bones and other injuries related to snow shoveling,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Thomas Esposito, chief of the Division of Trauma, Surgical Critical Care and Burns, Department of Surgery, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. Esposito recommends people with a history of back or heart problems ask someone else to do the heavy shoveling. If you have to do it yourself, know your limits and don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Shoveling is a very physical activity that is comparable to lifting heaving weights repeatedly and quickly,&amp;rdquo; said Kara Smith, special program coordinator for the Loyola Center for Fitness. &amp;ldquo;As with any exercise it&amp;rsquo;s important to begin with a five-to-10 minute warm-up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She suggests taking a brief walk or marching in place to get your body ready for the physical strain. Also, try adding arm movements and stretching your back to warm up the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are a few more tips to help you stay healthy during shoveling season:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Dress appropriately. Wearing layers allows you to adjust to the temperature outside. When you are going to be outside for a long time, cover your skin to prevent frostbite.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Use a small shovel that has a curved handle. A shovel with wet snow can weigh up to 15 pounds. A small shovel ensures you have a lighter load, which can prevent injury.&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Separate your hands on the shovel. By creating space between your hands, you can increase your leverage on the shovel.&lt;br /&gt;
	4. Lift with your legs, not your back. Make sure your knees are bending and straightening to lift the shovel instead of leaning forward and straightening with the back.&lt;br /&gt;
	5. Shovel frequently. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait till the snow piles up. Shovel intermittently, about every two inches.&lt;br /&gt;
	6. Push the snow. It is easier and better for your back to push the snow rather than lift it. Also, never throw snow over your shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
	7. Pace yourself. Take breaks and gently stretch your back, arms and legs before returning to work.&lt;br /&gt;
	8. Stay hydrated. Drinking plenty of water is important when exercising regardless of the outside temperature.&lt;br /&gt;
	9. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. These stimulants increase the heart rate and constrict blood vessels, putting strain on your heart.&lt;br /&gt;
	10. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can dull your senses and make you vulnerable to hypothermia and frostbite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Each season has its own particular set of risks, but winter with its snowstorms, plunging temperatures and wind chills can be especially daunting when it comes to safety,&amp;rdquo; said Esposito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/workplace_safety/~4/Y2Z35H_mHhY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
