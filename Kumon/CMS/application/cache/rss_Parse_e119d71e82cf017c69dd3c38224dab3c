            <title>SPM Instrument Introduces New Vibration Enveloping Technique</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SPM Instrument recently launched a new high-definition vibration enveloping technique for detection of early stage gear and bearing faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A complement to traditional vibration analysis, HD Enveloping utilizes engineered algorithms for digital signal processing, preserving the true highest peak of the vibration signal. Signals buried in machine noise are revealed through high-definition digital enveloping, extracting and enhancing the signals of interest from the overall machinery vibration signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Used to monitor applications in the 15-20,000 revolutions per minute range, the HD Enveloping technique can be employed with existing vibration transducer installations and easily integrates into industrial infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unit of measurement is HD Real Peak, which is a scalar value expressed in decibels. Representing the true amplitude levels found in the envelope signal, HD Real Peak is the primary value used for determining the severity of a given damage as well as for triggering alarms. Spectrums and time signals also provide a snapshot of machine condition to alert the maintenance department of a potential problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The setup of the HD Enveloping measurements in the diagnostic software is straightforward. A set of predefined filters are available for easy selection, with each designed to detect damages or anomalies in different stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Balancing Rigid Rotors in the Field</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.&amp;quot; â Nikola Tesla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Could Tesla&amp;#39;s secret be the energy wasted due to vibration at a frequency equal to shaft speed all caused by rotor unbalance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Balanced rotors are critical for achieving production and profit goals. Unbalance creates high vibration, which leads to other faults resulting in decreased machine life, wasted energy and reduced efficiency. Smooth-running machines are required for producing products that meet customer specifications. The IOSR Journal of Mechanical and Civil Engineering states that rotor unbalance is the major cause of vibration problems. A good balancing process is essential for successful physical asset management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is a Rigid Rotor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A rotor that operates at a rotational speed below 70 percent of its critical speed is considered to be a rigid rotor. The critical speed is the speed at which resonance occurs by exciting its natural frequency. Ninety percent or more of rotors are rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Unbalance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rotor unbalance can be defined as a condition that exists when the geometric center and the center of mass (also known as the center of gravity) do not coincide. In reality, these centers never coincide exactly, but the goal of rotor balancing is to reduce the unbalance to the point that machine life is not negatively impacted by the residual unbalance. The balancing technician attempts to bring the center of mass and the geometric center to the same point or close enough to meet a predetermined balance standard. There will always be some residual unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/3dbba8d6-8d57-4b78-8af9-7d31506f167e_figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 332px; height: 221px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Balancing Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several standards organizations have developed balancing standards for use on various machines. ISO and API are a couple of examples. Some companies develop their own standards. Which standard should you use? Choose standards that will allow you to achieve the required machine life and preserve equipment functions to the levels required by your processes. This may sound like a political answer, but in reality, the standards may vary depending on your plant&amp;#39;s requirements. The requirements will already be known if you are using a well-defined physical asset management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance is measured in units of ounce/inches or gram/millimeters. However, when you balance in the field, you usually balance to a vibration standard because it is easier to determine machine vibration levels than to determine residual unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vibration due to unbalance is directionally proportional to the amount of unbalance. If the vibration levels due to unbalance are lowered to an acceptable level, the amount of unbalance is also brought to within an acceptable standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Forces Incurred by Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unbalance produces rotor vibration.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Double the amount of unbalance, and the forces due to unbalance double.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Double the rotor speed, and the forces quadruple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Types of Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Static or force&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Couple&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dynamic or a combination of force and couple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/c000fa10-640c-4559-89dd-9b24c5fb111e_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 74px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Causes of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Blowholes in cast parts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eccentricity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improper key length&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stress relief distortion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermal distortion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Corrosion or uneven wear&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Deposit buildup and component shift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Asymmetrical design and assembly errors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotor damage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair work errors such as use of wrong coupling bolts or washers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Balancing is performed after acquiring vibration and phase measurements. There are three requirements for balancing: steady vibration, steady phase, and the vibration and phase measured must be due to rotor unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before attempting to field balance a rotor, follow these basic steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform a vibration analysis on the machine.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take radial and axial vibration readings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure the rotor is clean.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verify there are no loose parts on the rotor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always correct other problems before attempting to balance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use a dial indicator to check total indicated runout (TIR).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove previous balance correction weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collectors/analyzers such as the Vibxpert can be used to perform the vibration analysis necessary to identify unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/98ff7559-b808-4e6a-a260-7af14953b166_figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 324px; height: 368px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance is a radial force and produces a vibration frequency equal to shaft speed. The radial force can sometimes produce a vibration in an axial direction, especially in overhung or cantilevered rotors. In these rotors, the axial vibration may be even greater than the radial vibration. The radial force causes the shaft to deflect, producing an axial direction vibration in the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Normally, unbalance will produce a 1&amp;times; or shaft speed vibration that is 80 percent or more of the total vibration. If 1&amp;times; vibration is less than 80 percent, suspect other problems in addition to the unbalance. This is the same as stating that the vibration at other frequencies should not exceed 20 percent of the overall vibration. It may be necessary to correct the other problems before the rotor can be properly balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance always exerts an equal force in all radial directions, but the vibration due to the unbalance is almost never equal in all directions. The horizontal vibration is usually the highest in amplitude because most machines are less stiff in that direction. Be careful because there are exceptions such as looseness in the bearings and vertical resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If vibration amplitudes in the radial positions differ by 5:1 or more, other problems usually exist. If more than three harmonics of shaft speed are visible in the spectrum, other problems could be present, with the most likely being looseness. All other problems should be corrected before attempting to balance the rotor. The image below shows the corresponding measurement and weight correction planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/9e6f165d-05cd-479e-9137-fb29d5d3a1f3_figure 4.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 354px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Phase Indications of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase is a very important tool when diagnosing unbalance because 1&amp;times; vibration can be generated by several other problems. Phase numbers shown below may vary by 15 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Force unbalance phase difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 0 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Couple unbalance phase difference: &lt;/strong&gt;180 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic unbalance phase difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 0 to 180 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The phase shift from horizontal to vertical should be approximately 90 degrees for all types of rotor unbalance when measured on the same bearing. The phase should be steady and repeatable when attempting to balance. (It may become unstable after a trim balance because other problems tend to become more dominant.) A good indication of unbalance is that the phase difference between inboard horizontal (IBH) and outboard horizontal (OBH) should equal the phase difference between inboard vertical (IBV) and outboard vertical (OBV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase errors drastically affect balancing. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 7.5 degrees may produce an 8:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 15 degrees may produce a 4:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 30 degrees may produce a 2:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 60 degrees or more may produce no reduction in vibration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Balancing Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All rotors regardless of their diameter/width (D/W) ratio should be balanced in two planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, on overhung rotors, if vibration in the bearing nearest the overhung mass has an amplitude of approximately four times the vibration in the other bearing, single-plane balancing may work. Overhung rotors with a D/W ratio of 4:1 or more may sometimes be balanced within the tolerance by a single-plane balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, sometimes narrow overhung rotors don&amp;#39;t respond well to two-plane balancing. On overhung narrow rotors, it becomes more difficult to separate the influence of the two weight planes on the two measurement planes. This is simply because narrow rotor weight planes are in close proximity to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To determine if a two-plane balance job is needed, set up and take four measurements but enter only one correction plane (single plane). Ask the program for estimated reductions. If the estimates are within tolerance, continue with a single-plane balance. If the estimated reduction is out of tolerance, change the setup to two correction planes and continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Indications of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The time waveform should contain a strong sine wave component. Acceleration measurements distort the time waveform because higher frequencies are amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steady phase and steady amplitude are also requirements for balancing. If either is not steady, don&amp;#39;t diagnose the problem as unbalance. Sometimes it may be wise to make vibration measurements and then shut down the machine. Start the machine again and see if the vibration and phase measurements can be duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Selecting a Proper Trial Weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper trial weight (TW) selection is important because a weight that is too light may not provide an adequate response for calculating correction weights and placement. A trial weight that is too large may wreck the machine. Trial weights should adhere to the 30/30 rule: change the phase by 30 degrees or the amplitude by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Calculating Trial Weights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = Rotor weight &amp;times; 10 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = (1.77) &amp;times; (TW) &amp;times; (R) &amp;times; (rpm &amp;divide; 1,000)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where: F = Force in pounds, TW = Trial weight in ounces, R = Radius in inches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Example: 5,400-pound rotor, 1,800 rpm, 13.5-inch radius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = 5,400 &amp;times; 10 percent; F = 540&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	540 = (1.77) x (TW) x (13.5) x (3.24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	540 = 77.4 TW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TW = 6.98 ounces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Typical Single-Plane Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set up equipment on the rotor as outlined by the balance equipment manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make &amp;quot;reference run&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;calibration run,&amp;quot; measuring vibration and phase.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trial weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add correction weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trim run.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trim weight if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make no more than two trim runs. If more than two trim runs are needed to achieve the standard, leave all weights in place, erase the data collected on this balance job and begin the process anew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Typical Two-Plane Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set up equipment on the rotor as outlined by the balance equipment manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make &amp;quot;reference run&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;calibration run,&amp;quot; measuring vibration and phase.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trial weight to plane #1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run #1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight from plane #1 and place on plane #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight from plane #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add correction weights to planes #1 and #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trim run and add trim weights if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make no more than two trim runs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If balance job is not within specs after two trim runs, leave weights in place, erase the data collected on this balance job and begin the process anew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When rotors won&amp;#39;t stay in balance, the following problems should be suspected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermal sensitivity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operating near a resonance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotor erosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Material buildup&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speed changes bringing the machine into a resonance condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loose rotor part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mindset of &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a fan and it shakes so it must need balancing,&amp;quot; is referred to as the balancing syndrome and can get you into trouble. Here are some tips that will help you avoid such pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The time signal should not be too distorted from sinusoidal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The shaft speed vibration amplitude should be steady and repeatable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The phase should be steady and repeatable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No more than three harmonics of shaft speed should be present in the spectrum. (Plain bearings may be an exception.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There should be no raised noise floor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No sub-harmonics should be present.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The rotor should be clean and free of buildup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Balancing should be the last corrective measure (correct obvious problems first).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rotors do not become unbalanced without a cause. If a rotor has been acceptably balanced and becomes unbalanced, always try to detect and correct the root cause of the unbalance. Sometimes rotor-reinforcing gussets may crack, allowing the rotor to deform and resulting in a sudden unbalance. If the rotor is rebalanced without repairing the cracks, sudden and catastrophic machine failure may occur if the gussets fail completely. Such problems can usually be avoided by performing a thorough cleaning and inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration is measured in displacement, velocity and acceleration. Velocity and acceleration are generally the most often used units, but when you balance rotors, you usually use displacement measured in mils. This is because displacement gives the best indication at low frequencies, and you are dealing with 1&amp;times; shaft speed when balancing. The technician needs to be aware that 1 mil of vibration on a machine running at 900 rpm is not comparable to 1 mil of vibration on a machine operating at 3,600 rpm. There is considerably more force exerted on the 3,600 rpm machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Why a Balance Job Goes Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The top causes for failing to achieve the required standard when balancing include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A mistake in setting up the data collector/analyzer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failing to remove a trial weight&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A problem that is not unbalance (usually looseness)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Entering the trial weight location incorrectly into the balancing instrument&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overhung load requiring two-plane balance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Weight placement not in the proper direction with relation to the rotor direction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Existing resonant condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Becoming proficient at rotor balancing requires having good tools and being knowledgeable in their use. A fundamental knowledge of balancing theory and balancing procedures is also critical for success. Having a good grasp of vibration analysis will help to ensure that the technician performs balancing only when the problem is unbalance. Because of many variables, there remains some art to balancing. With better tools and an improved knowledge, base balancing has become less of an art and more of an applied science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/EcteUxTnZ7M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IMI Launches Vibration Monitoring System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/7/5/2a501ec8-8386-4d53-905f-e5a7231c15c9_IMI Echo image.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 203px; float: left;" /&gt;IMI Sensors recently introduced the new Echo wireless vibration monitoring system, which is designed to allow users to monitor the health of critical machinery more frequently and safely than walk-around systems while helping to reduce downtime and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Requiring no gateways, mesh or repeaters, the system uses extended range radio frequency (ERRF) technology to transmit long distances in typical plant environments. It transmits at only 0.75 milliwatts effective radiated power (ERP) in the unlicensed 900 megahertz band and does not interfere with other wireless communications such as Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of wireless vibration sensors, a junction box, a receiver and monitoring software. Each wireless vibration sensor can be programmed to transmit data at a pre-determined interval, and a lone receiver is capable of accepting data from hundreds of sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Users can transmit data from existing analog inductively coupled plasma (ICP) accelerometers using the 8-channel wireless junction box. The transmitted data set features overall vibration measurements scaled in acceleration, velocity, true peak and crest factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring software allows predictive maintenance (PdM) professionals to establish alarm values, plot vibration data over time, generate reports and receive email alerts. By using the alarm panel included in the software, PdM professionals can see the status of all monitored points at a glance and focus valuable manpower on analyzing faulty machines rather than taking data on healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobius Awarded Accreditation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced that its board of certification has been awarded accreditation by International Accreditation Foundation (IAF) member JAS-ANZ, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17024 and ISO 18436-1, to provide vibration analysis certification per ISO 18436-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mobius Institute Board of Certification (MIBoC) is an independent entity within the Mobius Institute organization that is directed to ensure Mobius and its authorized training centers deliver training and certification that meet or exceed the requirements defined by ISO 18436-1 and 18436-2 standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through an extensive audit and review process by Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ), MIBoC was awarded accreditation. Accreditation awarded by an IAF member organization, under the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA), ensures mutual recognition of accredited certification between signatories to the MLA and are recognized worldwide based on their equivalent accreditation programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute joins Vibration Institute of the United States and British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing (BINDT) as being accredited to provide certification to vibration analysts according to ISO 18436-1 and 18436-2. Based on a review of previous certification records, JAS-ANZ has declared that all Mobius Institute certified analysts in more than 126 countries are qualified to receive a revised certificate that recognizes their achievement as being certified in accordance with ISO 18436-1 and ISO 18436-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Accreditation is a significant milestone for Mobius Institute and our family of worldwide authorized training partners,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;We have worked hard to develop a practical and impartial certification scheme, so it was particularly gratifying when JAS-ANZ recognized that our previous certification practices met the requirements of the relevant standards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobius Introduces Machine-balancing Training Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced the release of iLearnBalancing, a computer-based training product that teaches maintenance professionals how to perform in-place dynamic balancing of industrial machines. The training is delivered by DVD or through the Web via the iLearn-online learning portal and is run on a personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The software is designed to provide complete understanding of the different types of unbalance, including static, couple and dynamic unbalance, as well as what is needed to correct them. It also offers ways to ensure that you are not chasing the wrong solution during the balance process, how to tell if a machine is truly out of balance and whether there&amp;rsquo;s another fault condition with similar symptoms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s iLearnInteractive product line, iLearnBalancing features extensive 3-D animations and simulators to make the subject more interesting and understandable. The interactive course is fully narrated, making it easier to learn. Simulators are used so you can experience the interaction between unbalance, rotational speed and phase, and how they affect the balance vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, machine balancing has been as much an art as it has been a skill,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;iLearnBalancing demystifies machine balancing in an easily understandable format so that maintenance technicians learn everything they need to be successful. A well-balanced machine experiences less wear and has a longer life cycle, thus improving your plant&amp;rsquo;s overall availability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Acoustic Emission: The Next Generation of Vibration Techniques</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	History, experience and familiarity count for a lot where conditioning monitoring is concerned, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate the need for change, innovation and the advancement of tried, tested and trusted techniques. The late Steve Jobs commented: &amp;ldquo;Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity, not a threat.&amp;rdquo; Condition monitoring (CM) is transforming rapidly and so too must the mindset of CM practitioners and users. It&amp;rsquo;s not good enough to simply disregard a disruptive technology in an effort to protect the &amp;ldquo;old guard.&amp;rdquo; When combating downtime, there&amp;rsquo;s no place for historical sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steadily disrupting traditional vibration techniques is acoustic emission (AE). AE technology spawned from the aviation industry where vibration analysis simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easily applied, short of a suicidal maintenance technician hanging off the wings. AE technique is based on frequencies much higher than are monitored in the repetitive, synchronous movement of vibration. These frequencies are the result of shock, impact, friction and cracking, for example. By this means, it is possible to detect impending failure before damage occurs, as well as monitoring its progress thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With well-defined ISO standards, traditional vibration techniques including vibration monitoring and vibration analysis have provided a trusted approach to condition monitoring for the past 30 years. Yet, it remains a complex science and requires sophisticated knowledge and understanding from a seasoned expert. In contrast, AE technology extends and simplifies the science, placing the power of vibration techniques directly into the hands of every engineer. Signals can be processed at the AE sensor into an easily understandable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, vibration analysis (VA) as a technique will have a place for many for years to come for many end users. However, there is no escaping the fact that there is often a requirement for a costly and unsustainable level of knowledge required to affect a good diagnosis. For VA, the defect repetition frequencies are critically dependent upon the machine component design and geometry, as well as the precise running speed. Vibration can occur independently in the X, Y or Z axis, and so orientation of the sensor is as important as location. For a detailed interpretation, it is also necessary to know internal machine geometries, shaft speeds, meshing frequencies, etc., and to analyze the data before making a diagnosis. So in summary, VA is valuable but too often overly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With acoustic emission (AE), signal processing is undertaken automatically at the sensor level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/22/14a5d756-7be9-4324-9269-88385a7834fd_VA.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 421px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With vibration analysis (VA), the signal is processed downstream manually or semi-automatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The areas in which vibration and AE both apply can be illustrated as overlapping circles. However, AE provides an earlier warning, detecting wear and small defects, whereas with vibration, damage must have occurred to detect a signal. AE will pick up a lack of lubrication, friction and cracking, which vibration will not, although it must be acknowledged that the totality of information obtained from AE will be more limited than that derived from vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The signal processing required by AE is not something that can be performed by just anyone; it&amp;rsquo;s a high-frequency signal, so the user must have the knowledge to interpret the squiggly lines on a stethoscope. However, recent developments have enabled this processing at the sensor level. The sensor output can now provide pre-characterized numbers that tell you about the condition of the machine. AE technology has been effectively de-skilled, enabling much wider application use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suitable for continuously running machinery as well as machinery operating intermittently, slowly or for short durations, AE allows the user to diagnose problems with machinery at an early stage, carry out maintenance procedures and then monitor the improvement. It provides real-time information with early sensitivity to faults and applicability to a wide range of rotational speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As awareness of the unique capabilities of AE increases, so too does the number of applications that it is suited to, many of which have proven difficult for other forms of condition monitoring to address. For example, the analysis of signals, whether from AE sensors or accelerometers, requires a sufficiently long period of machine running at constant speed so that a statistically meaningful signal characterization can be made. But that is where the similarity stops. AE can be effective after around 10 seconds of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the algorithm used to derive the widely used acoustic emission parameters of Distress and dB Level in the MHC range of products from Kittiwake Holroyd requires a 10-second period of running at an approximately constant speed. This compares favorably to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based vibration analysis, which typically needs 60 to 120 seconds of measurement time and tight tolerances on machine speed for an effective signal interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In cases where a hand-held instrument is used for periodic CM, it may be possible to interrupt normal machine operation and put it into a special continuously running mode for the duration of CM measurements. However, such disruption is not always possible and never convenient. Furthermore, it is not compatible with the current trend toward CM automation, which requires continuous online monitoring with permanently installed sensors inputting CM data or status into supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems or programmable logic controllers (PLCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why are many CM practitioners being so resistant to the benefits that AE brings to the table? It may be because many people have invested a lifetime in vibration and are understandably wary of losing power and status. After all, if you &amp;ldquo;dumb down&amp;rdquo; vibration, surely this reduces the perceived value that they bring to the organization. Actually, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Just because AE is disruptive as a technology, it in no way invalidates traditional vibration techniques but simply extends the impact way beyond what has been able to be achieved to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For vibration techniques to be effective, you need equipment that&amp;rsquo;s far from cheap coupled with clever people to get the best from it. Every result must be analyzed to understand what&amp;rsquo;s good and what&amp;rsquo;s bad. For those who cannot afford the luxury of in-house vibration experts, there are many vibration specialists who offer a contract monitoring service, which is not an insignificant investment. While for some, the criticality of certain applications coupled with the scale of some companies might justify this cost, others could still benefit from the efficiencies realized by similar CM techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, the &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t buy into one-month wonders/we&amp;rsquo;ve all been bitten by the latest whizz-bang technology&amp;rdquo; argument no longer rings true. Indeed, AE techniques are only deemed disruptive because they are now mature with a proven track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultimately, maintenance personnel are responsible for keeping machinery running. If they are empowered to monitor condition themselves, identify where action is needed and then check that the action taken has solved the problem, then AE has significant advantages of cost, speed, flexibility and ease of field application in comparison to traditional vibration analysis techniques. It is the efficient and effective approach to CM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To nurture the technology of a new era, a broader, longer-term view is required. Surely it makes sense to embrace CM techniques that provide for the greatest protection or longest period of warning for potential damage and eventual failure. By &amp;ldquo;de-skilling&amp;rdquo; technology, all maintenance professionals are empowered to make informed decisions quickly and with confidence, ultimately enabling them to positively and significantly impact a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. Of course, there is room for sentiment in business but not at the expense of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/jwbgDwroNgY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Orbits for Condition Monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Orbits have historically been used to measure relative shaft movement within a journal-type bearing.&amp;nbsp;The shape of the orbit told the analyst how the shaft was behaving within the bearing as well as the probable cause of the movement. This was accomplished using proximity probes usually mounted through the bearings with a 90-degree separation and a tip clearance set to around 0.050 inches. With today&amp;rsquo;s modern analyzers, it is possible to also collect an orbit using case-mounted velocity probes or accelerometers to see how the machine housing is moving. Another way of putting it would be the orbit represents the absolute path in space that the machine housing moves through (see Figure 1).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/1/1d1870dc-72ac-495f-8d50-4b29bfc6e141_figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/1/a881d179-0d15-44cc-a058-b718eb2f25c8_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is accomplished utilizing a two-channel instrument and collecting an orbit with the sensor of choice being a velocity probe or accelerometer. This is what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as a poor man&amp;rsquo;s operating deflection shape or ODS (see Figure 2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The analyst can interpret the data to determine machine movement at a particular measurement location or a section of the machine if a tachometer trigger is used during orbit collection as a phase reference. Analysts must keep in mind the exact location of each sensor so that when they look at the shape of the orbit it is possible to tell the movement in relationship to the sensor&amp;rsquo;s location. The sensors should be placed 90 degrees apart or at least as close as possible to 90 degrees. Keep in mind that a properly wired sensor shows motion toward the sensor as a positive signal and motion away from the sensor as a negative signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An orbit is usually collected while the machine is at its normal operating state or speed, but it can also be collected while the machine is increasing or decreasing in speed, such as during a coast-down or startup. The data can be collected in a steady state, in what is known as an unfiltered orbit, requiring no tachometer (see Figures 3 and 3A), or at multiples of running speeds such as first, second or third order to look for issues relating to that or another specific frequency (see Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Using Dynamic Electric Motor Monitoring to Identify Mechanical Issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic electric motor testing is often called on-line testing because it requires the motor to be running and generally assumes the motor is in its natural environment. Dynamic testing involves the connection of voltage probes and current transformers. Connecting dynamic test equipment is safe, quick and non-intrusive. Data is acquired and results are displayed in a summary format. The collected data is compared to the user-entered nameplate information and is presented in a pass/fail format with both current test data and trending logs displayed after each successive test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Motor Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every reliability technician knows that costs associated with motor failures can be devastating to any business operation. Finding that a motor is operating with conditions that create excessive heat or stress is a guide to the technician to make changes in the motor&amp;rsquo;s operation and to monitor its insulation. Knowing that a motor is in imminent danger of failing provides the technician with time to schedule repairs at his convenience rather than having the motor dictate to him due to a catastrophic failure. Reducing unscheduled downtime while increasing efficiency and profitability are common goals of all reliability technicians. Dynamic motor testing and monitoring is a relatively new concept aiding and advancing the capabilities of those responsible for the safe and continuous operation of electric motors and related equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What Dynamic Testing Tells You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor is one part of a complete system that includes incoming power quality, the motor and the driven load. Many motor problems are created by poor incoming power quality, and many more problems can be attributed to the load and load-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	State-of-the-art dynamic motor test equipment is capable of separating electrical issues from mechanical issues as well as defining power-related problem areas. Good test equipment will provide an enormous amount of information regarding the incoming power, including voltage levels, imbalances and harmonic content. A small amount of voltage imbalance will result in a much larger amount of current imbalance and increase losses within the motor. Harmonic distortion also results in wasted energy causing overheating due mainly to non-sinusoidal sine waves. These issues directly affect a motor&amp;rsquo;s performance and its ability to handle its load. Overall, poor power quality manifests itself as higher heat within the stator and rotor, reducing efficiency and eventually resulting in premature motor failures. Monitoring power quality and making necessary adjustments are essential in maintaining motor longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides power condition, dynamic testing provides extensive information about the motor&amp;rsquo;s behavior and offers evidence of potential mechanical problem areas. The test equipment tracks current levels and unbalances, load levels and torque-related information. Combining this data with the power quality information, the equipment can predict de-rating factors that indicate potential problem areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque and torque ripple add another piece of the puzzle that is required for consistent and accurate diagnosis of the motor&amp;rsquo;s health. Torque ripple is defined as the division of maximal torque divided by average torque during the acquisition period. The torque ripple itself is a measure of how small the torque band is that surrounds a steady state average torque. Torque ripple is independent of power condition and current level. It provides a visual look at how the driven load is performing and is an indicator of rotor stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing can identify rotor bar problems with a high degree of accuracy, and trending logs make tracking them over time easy and predictable. Rotor bar and cage defects result in lost efficiency and higher heat culminating in premature motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring and tracking efficiency is a very difficult task. The operating efficiency of a motor cannot be easily measured in a field application. Many standards have a number of requirements that commonly can only be fulfilled in a laboratory environment. These standards also usually concentrate on ensuring a proper description of a motor&amp;#39;s capabilities under good operating voltage conditions.&amp;nbsp;In the field, however, there is little room for requirements like uncoupling a motor or regulating the voltage level for a saturation run. Questions regarding a particular motor&amp;#39;s capabilities are found to be secondary in importance when compared to the operating efficiency under the given conditions in the field. The result of such an environment is that true efficiencies are unrealistic to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating efficiencies, however, are of crucial importance to an energy-conscious management. The requirements for a true measurement of operating efficiency in a field environment are ample and unrealistic (like installing torque transducers on the shaft of the motor and measuring the input power to the motor at the motor terminals, frequently at high voltage levels). Instead of true efficiency measurement, efficiency estimation becomes the only field-friendly approach for energy management.&amp;nbsp;The difference between operating efficiency measurement and operating efficiency estimation is that the former attempts to find the true operating efficiency via direct measurement, while the latter accepts a small measure of inaccuracy for severely increased user friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a controlled laboratory experiment, vibration analysis and dynamic data were acquired on a new 5-horsepower, 460-volt motor. The motor was disassembled, and the outer race of the drive-end bearing was intentionally damaged (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/85b88efa-0fda-4eda-bb53-3abb5bb64f99_Thomas Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 2px; width: 646px; height: 581px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor was reassembled, and new data collected. The common formula used in vibration analysis was applied to the data acquired, and the results were posted on both the vibration spectra and the torque spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resulting calculations concluded that the outer race defect should appear at 107 hz with sidebands related to the motor speed in the vibration spectra and twice the fundamental frequency in the torque spectra (Figures 2 and 3). The outer race defect with its sidebands was much easier to determine in the dynamically acquired data than the vibration spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rotor Bar Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another laboratory-controlled study, a 1-horsepower motor running under full load on a small dynamometer was tested thoroughly with the dynamic tester. The results were then saved and analyzed. The rotor was removed, and a 5/8-inch hole was drilled through one rotor bar, severing it completely. The motor was assembled and retested under identical conditions. Again, the results were saved and then compared to the original data (Figures 4 and 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/9551e808-da98-4f36-8547-487c25674ae6_Thomas Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 387px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broken rotor bar was clearly defined in the current signature analysis without any difficulty or intensive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cavitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a large electric power plant in North Carolina, mechanics noticed that one of three 15,000-horsepower pumps developed a lower flow level than the other two. The mechanics blamed the motor, while the electricians maintained the pump was at fault. Dynamic electric data was acquired and analyzed. Figure 6 shows the resultant torque ripples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/eb3b70c5-41ad-4096-85e6-85945db08a61_Thomas Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One pump displayed the large variations in the torque ripple, while the two pumps that were operating normally had the smaller torque signature. As a result of this testing, a diver was sent into the pit and found that the bolts on one end-bell had rusted off, allowing the flute that directed water into the pump to fall off. This situation caused the pump to circulate water outside the pump and created cavitation. Bolts on the other pumps were also in need of replacement and would have failed in the near future. The downtime required to make the repairs cost the facility several million dollars, but the increased productivity after the repairs easily compensated for those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, dynamic motor testing and the state-of-the-art equipment available today are rapidly becoming the tools of choice for reliability technicians worldwide. The technology is quite young, and new innovations are continuously expanding its capabilities and horizons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/n5rb3KB_7vY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New Testing Methods Can Benefit Mechanical Systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Experimental modal analysis (EMA) and operating deflection shape (ODS) analysis are new techniques used to animate the dynamic response of mechanical systems. An EMA provides mode shapes associated with natural frequencies of a mechanical system. An ODS offers an animation of the deformation characteristics of a vibrating mechanical system during operation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The animations can be extremely helpful in defining areas of structural weakness or identifying areas of mechanical &amp;ldquo;looseness.&amp;rdquo; In cases of resonant excitation, the animation techniques can be used to evaluate the potential benefit of structural and/or mechanical modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Experimental Modal Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Excitation of a natural frequency, referred to as resonance, is one of the most common reasons for excessive vibration of machines and supporting structures and foundations. In some cases, the source of the dynamic force that excites the resonance can be identified and removed. However, in most cases, the solution to the resonance problem requires design modifications directed at changing the natural frequencies. A complete understanding of the modal parameters of the mechanical system is imperative to any study involving the development of a structural or mechanical modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many experimental procedures available for identifying the modal parameters of a mechanical system. Modal parameters are dynamic characteristics of a system and include the natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping for each mode of natural frequency. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is a test and analysis procedure that provides estimates for all of the modal parameters of a mechanical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An understanding of the mode shape is necessary for the evaluation of structural and/or mechanical modifications proposed for a vibrating mechanical system. The mode shape will provide information relative to locations within the mechanical system that are too flexible. This information can be used for the optimization of the design of any modification made for the purpose of altering the modal characteristics of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An EMA requires impact response data for many locations and directions, referred to as degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom of the test must be sufficient to accurately define all of the mode shapes. The relative magnitude and phase information at all of the degrees of freedom are plotted to provide an animation of the mode shape at every natural frequency. EMA software is commercially available to facilitate the curve fitting and animation of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experimental modal analysis can be performed using either one of two impact test methods: fixed excitation or fixed response. In the fixed excitation test, the impact location and direction remains stationary for the entire test. The response transducer is moved to obtain data at all of the degree of freedom locations. This is referred to as roving with the response transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed response test method requires that a response transducer remains stationary at a single data location while the impact hammer is moved to excite the mechanical system at each and every degree of freedom. This is referred to as roving with the impact hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The principle of Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s reciprocity states that the results obtained using either of the test methods will be identical if the mechanical system is perfectly linear elastic.&amp;nbsp; However, very few real industrial mechanical systems are perfectly linear elastic. Non-linearities introduced by bolted connections, fluid films, load related support stiffness, etc., will affect the results of the modal test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed excitation method is recommended to minimize the effect of structural and mechanical non-linearities. The participation of a non-linearity in any mode shape will be nearly constant if the force used to excite the mechanical system is applied in the same place during the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed response method is typically used to test mechanical systems that are constructed of non-magnetic materials, thus requiring the response transducer to be attached using epoxy cement or other adhesive. The time required to complete a modal test of a complex mechanical system can be prohibitive if the fixed excitation method is used and a response transducer is cemented to the mechanical system at each data location. For non-magnetic structures, the fixed response method is much faster, requiring a single transducer to be cemented to the mechanical system as a reference point. Data is then obtained by simply exciting the system at each and every degree of freedom with the impact hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Experimental Modal Analysis Case History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Catastrophic fatigue failures of industrial fan wheels have been attributed to the excitation of natural frequencies (resonance) during operation. The most common causes for this type of failure are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Excitation of the principal nodal line (wobble) mode of the rotor by dynamic forces produced at either one or two times the rotation speed of the fan. Dynamic forces are normally developed at one times the rotational speed of the fan due to imbalance. However, dynamic forces can also be developed at one or two times by misalignment, disk skew, looseness between fan wheel and shaft, structural asymmetry, bent shaft, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Excitation of the principal nodal circle (umbrella)or two nodal diameter (chip) modes of the fan wheel by pressure pulsations produced at the blade pass frequency or by aerodynamic (rotating stall) or acoustic sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An impact test can be performed to determine the natural frequencies of a fan rotor. A picture of a typical shop test arrangement for the modal analysis of a single wide fan is shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/9d5ab98d-b882-4a8f-b13c-142d18936594_Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 479px; height: 348px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 1. Single Wide Fan Rotor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experimental modal test of the fan rotor was performed to identify the natural frequencies and mode shapes thereof. The results of the modal test were then compared to the frequencies associated with dynamic forces produced during operation to evaluate the probability of resonant excitation. The fan wheel was designed to operate at 1,180 rpm (19.67 Hz). Since the fan wheel contained 12 blades, it would produce a dynamic blade pass pressure pulsation at 236 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/203d2ada-7e46-49db-80c8-a1855263461f_Figure 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 440px; height: 457px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. Impact Test Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 contains the results of an impact test performed to identify the natural frequencies of the rotor. The upper plot shows the &amp;ldquo;ring-down&amp;rdquo; response. A trigger delay was used such that some of the data prior to the application of the impact force was retained in the FFT Analyzer. The amount of background noise can be visualized in addition to the approximate &amp;ldquo;ring down&amp;rdquo; signal/background noise ratio. The &amp;ldquo;ring down&amp;rdquo; characteristic of this waveform is a clear indication of a valid impact test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lower plot is the transfer function. The transfer function is obtained by dividing the frequency spectrum of the response data by the frequency spectrum of the impact force. It is an indicator of sensitivity since it is in units of the amount of motion per pound of force. Peaks in the transfer function curve are indicative of a natural frequency. Natural frequencies are evident at 42.5 Hz, 73 Hz, 107.5 Hz, 140 Hz, 175 Hz, and 236.5 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/1461d16a-4159-4635-991c-eb9e9bfc64a7_Figure 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 448px; height: 481px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Figure 3. Mode shape at 42.5 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A complete experimental modal test was performed to determine the mode shape for each natural frequency. A side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 42.5 Hz is included in Figure 3. This mode shape is commonly referred to as the principal &amp;ldquo;wobble&amp;rdquo; mode. It is also referred to as a single nodal line mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips form a nearly straight single line, having one maximum positive and one maximum negative nodal location. This mode was not considered a problem since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either the blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 contains the mode shape for the natural frequency at 73 Hz. This mode shape is commonly referred to as the &amp;ldquo;umbrella&amp;rdquo; mode.&amp;nbsp; It is also referred to as the principal nodal circle mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips form a nearly straight single line and all move in phase axially together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This mode can be very sensitive to dynamic pressures since the entire surface of the back plate of the fan wheel moves in phase. However, it was not considered a problem for the subject fan since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 140 Hz is included in Figure 5. This mode shape is the two nodal diameter mode, sometimes referred to as the &amp;ldquo;butterfly&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;chip&amp;rdquo; mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips (trailing edges) form a curved surface with two maximum positive and two maximum negative axial nodal deformations. Once again, this mode was not considered a problem since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either the blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/09a0f591-89f7-44a1-9a11-a6951af877c1_Figure 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 442px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Mode shape at 73 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/d9db798d-edee-4d64-a5fb-47aa2ea47ab0_Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 438px; height: 486px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 5. Mode shape at 140 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The experimental modal study indicated that the natural frequencies associated with the major modes of concern were all separated from the frequencies of dynamic forces produced by the fan and should not be a problem. However, the impact test identified a natural frequency at around 236.5 Hz, which almost coincided with the blade pass pressure pulsation frequency. The mode shape for this natural frequency was developed to investigate the potential for excitation thereof by the dynamic pressure pulsations that would be developed by the fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/ec6247b6-3af7-466d-b9ce-5b71fbebe6fe_Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 439px; height: 474px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 6. Mode shape at 236.5 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 6 contains a side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 236.5 Hz. This mode shape is referred to as a four nodal diameter mode. The axial deformation of the fan forms a curved surface with four maximum positive and four maximum negative axial nodal deformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The natural frequencies identified by the impact tests were for a stationary wheel. The actual operating natural frequencies will be affected by centrifugal stress stiffening and gyroscopic effects. Although centrifugal stress stiffening generally has less of an effect on the higher energy mode shapes, such as the four nodal diameter mode, it would only have to be increased by a small amount to fall outside of the magnification range of the natural frequency. The amplification range of this natural frequency is limited due to the extremely low amount of damping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The experimental modal study discovered a higher energy mode with a potential for excitation. Although this mode would not be as sensitive to dynamic pressure pulsations as the previous two modes, if excited, it could still adversely affect the fatigue life of the fan wheel and the reliability of the air-handling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the results of the experimental modal test, this fan wheel was strain gauged to evaluate the dynamic stresses during operation and confirm that the stress stiffened value for the natural frequency was not a problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	ODS Test Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The test procedure for an operating deflection shape analysis consists of acquiring information regarding the displacement and phase of a mechanical system at any discrete frequency. An ODS test is performed while the equipment is in operation using either single- or multi-channel instrumentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step in either a single-channel or multi-channel operating deflection shape test is to develop the ODS model that will be used to animate the data. The number and location of data points used in the model must be sufficient to describe the deformation characteristics of the mechanical system. An inadequate number of data point locations could result in visual aliasing that could lead to a misleading ODS animation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amount of data required to provide an accurate ODS animation is dependent upon the vibrating mechanical system to be analyzed. An understanding of the structural dynamics of the system is necessary to develop an optimum ODS test procedure. Knowledge gained from preliminary vibration test results can be used to optimize the test procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Novice analysts should obtain as much data as possible. The acquisition of too much data will not hurt the operating deflection shape animation. Also, since the ODS test is performed while the equipment is operating, the extra time required to obtain additional information beyond what is optimally required should not affect the productivity of the equipment, although the same cannot be said for the productivity of the analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data acquisition technique used in a single-channel analysis differs from a multi-channel analysis. In either method, attention to bookkeeping is extremely important to ensure an accurate animation of the vibration data. Each data point must be stored with proper identification, including identification number, direction and sign (+/-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Single-Channel ODS Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a single-channel test, the operating deflection shape animation is based upon the absolute amount of response obtained for each vibration measurement. Phase information is obtained from a tach signal, usually placed on a shaft that rotates at the frequency at which the animation is desired. Response data is obtained by roving with a transducer among all of the data points in the mechanical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration data should be acquired in all three orthogonal directions for each data point location. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom in the ODS animation will be three times the number of data points identified in the model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration and phase must be obtained for each degree of freedom. This information can then be manually entered into a commercially available modal/ODS computer program to obtain the animation of the deflected shape of the mechanical equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Multi-Channel ODS Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The animation of multi-channel ODS test data is based upon a curve fit of the magnitude of vibration at multiple locations throughout a mechanical system relative to the magnitude of vibration at a single reference location. The phase information required for the animation is obtained from the cross-channel function of the reference and response transducers. A tach signal is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/96d15167-dd0c-4cd7-876d-edb5ca12d317_Figure 7.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 474px; height: 319px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 7. Multi-channel ODS Test Setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 7 shows a typical multi-channel ODS test setup. The reference transducer should be placed at a location that contains a significant response at every frequency at which an ODS animation is desired. It remains stationary during the entire test. Response data is obtained by roving with a transducer among all of the data points in the mechanical system, collecting data in all three orthogonal directions for each data point identified in the ODS model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The frequency response function (FRF) for each data point contains the phase and relative magnitude of vibration between the reference and response transducers. Many multi-channel analyzers have the capability of automatically transferring the FRFs to commercially available ODS software, eliminating the need to manually input data. The ODS software is then used to provide an animation of the deflected shape of the mechanical system at any discrete frequency within the frequency range of data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One advantage of multi-channel testing is that the variation in vibration that might occur during an ODS test will not affect the accuracy of the animation because a multi-channel ODS is based upon the relative magnitude of vibration between the response and reference transducer. For linear mechanical systems, the vibration at the response transducer will increase or decrease in direct proportion with the reference transducer. This is important for lengthy tests of large mechanical systems. Data can be appended to a multi-channel ODS animation months or years later if the structural dynamic characteristics of the mechanical system are not changed. Since a single-channel ODS animation is based upon the absolute magnitude of vibration at the time of acquisition, variations in vibration will adversely affect the accuracy of the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, a single-channel operating deflection shape is limited to the animation of the response of the mechanical system at the rotational frequency of the shaft at which the reference signal is obtained. Multi-channel ODS animations can be developed at any frequency within the defined frequency range of the analyzer. This is important in cases where vibration does not occur at either shaft speed or a harmonic multiple (such as aerodynamic and flow-induced vibration, response to broadband excitation, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	ODS vs. Modal Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating deflection shape analysis is often used to either supplement or sometimes replace a modal analysis. If a mechanical system produces a dynamic force at or near a natural frequency, the resultant operating deflection shape will approximate the mode shape for that particular natural frequency. Since an ODS test is performed while equipment is operating, it can be used to define the structural dynamic characteristics of a resonant condition without interrupting production. A modal test requires that the equipment not be operating, which in some industrial processes can be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An operating deflection shape analysis cannot identify natural frequencies that are not excited during operation of the mechanical system. Therefore, the ODS test does guarantee that other mode shapes do not exist. Impact testing is recommended to identify all natural frequencies within the frequency range of concern before modifying any mechanical system based upon the results of an ODS animation.

            <title>Identifying Mechanical Faults with Motor Current Signature Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has proven to be a highly valuable predictive maintenance tool. Although it is a relatively young, rarely utilized technology, it is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry today. Mechanical faults related to belts, couplers, alignment and more are easily found through the use of a demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MCSA is simply the process by which motor current readings are recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain. It has been around since 1985 and proven itself well over the years in locating rotor faults and air gap problems in motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor current signature is recorded in a time domain format. The current is represented in a graph form with the amplitude shown on the &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; axis and the time on the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; axis. The result is a typical current sinewave shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to analyze the data, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed. An FFT is a mathematical operation designed to extract the frequency information from the time domain and transform it into the frequency domain. An example of an FFT spectrum is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the FFT spectrum is a great source for identification of rotor bar problems in motors, it proved difficult to analyze most other frequencies. In order to address this problem, the demodulated current spectrum was developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/23/eb7d1922-096a-4a94-b83b-1770a99cbe8a_Figure 1-2.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 182px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Time Domain Format&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. FFT Format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Demodulated Current Spectrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, one of the most exciting advancements in PdM technologies is the demodulated current spectrum. In order to better understand demodulation, the concept of modulation should briefly be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modulation is when lower frequencies are merged on top of a higher frequency. In other words, lower frequencies ride on the higher frequency signal. This makes the carrier frequency the dominant peak in the FFT spectrum, and most of the information is lost in the noise floor of the spectrum. Although they have always been present in the current spectrum, the repetitive load variation frequencies have been difficult to identify and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demodulation is simply the process of taking the carrier frequency out of the spectrum. In this case, the carrier frequency is the fundamental electrical frequency being used. The fundamental frequency in the United States is 60 Hz. In many other countries, it is 50 Hz. After removing the carrier frequency, the frequencies related to repetitive load variations are left behind and shown on the demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequencies such as speed, pole pass, belt pass, vane pass, gears and bearing frequencies can be identified and trended in the demodulated current spectrum. In effect, the motor is acting like a permanently installed transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the technology being relatively new, trending remains the most accurate method of identifying a problem in a machine. The ability to have baseline data when the machine is in good health is ideal, while comparing data to similar machines is also very effective. In the future, as historical and statistical data is compiled, there will be more alarming guidelines established for different types of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Locating Belt Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic current signature of a belt-driven machine is shown in Figure 3. It shows the fundamental 60 Hz frequency being the dominant peak. Note the sideband peaks on each side of 60 Hz that are labeled with their frequencies. This type of signature has the potential of being misconstrued as a potential rotor bar problem. In this example, the sidebands are actually related to belt pass frequency. The mechanical frequency in rotations per minute (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) is calculated using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Mechanical frequency = (the change&amp;nbsp;between line frequency and peak of interest) x 60&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mechanical frequency of interest in this case would then be calculated by multiplying 6.5 Hz by 60. The result would be 390 &lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;, which is the belt pass frequency of this machine. Rotor bar problems show up at pole pass frequency, with the peaks much closer to the fundamental frequency. Pole pass frequency is calculated with the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;PolePass= synchronous speed &amp;ndash; (slip frequency / # of poles)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/18/ba32daa5-0094-4505-bf4d-2c84153b6daf_Figure 3 and 4.jpeg" style="width: 601px; height: 246px;" /&gt;Figure 3. Belted machine current spectrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Demodulated spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the mechanical peaks in Figure 3 are prevalent, this is often not the case. Usually, the mechanical peaks will be lost in the noise floor of this type of spectrum. This is where the demodulated signal becomes so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 shows the demodulated spectrum derived from the current signature in Figure 3. Notice how much cleaner and easier to read this example appears. Without the 60 Hz electrical frequency present, the remaining mechanical frequencies become much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sideband frequencies shown in Figure 3 now show up in Figure 4 at 6.5 Hz along with a 2x and 3x belt pass frequency in the demodulated spectrum. Looking closely at the current spectrum, the 2x and 3x frequencies are present but not as easily identified. Belt pass peaks in this type of spectrum are good early indicators of belt alignment, wear and sheave problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Running Speed Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both drive and driven speeds will also be found in the spectrum if there is a problem. As in vibration, a 1x rotational speed will signify an unbalanced effect on the machine. In Figure 4, the fan speed shows up at just over 25 Hz. In Figure 5, the running speed of an 1,800-&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt; pump motor can be identified at just less than 30 Hz. In both cases, trending the amplitude of these peaks can tell us many things about the condition of the machine. Normally, this peak will be at or near the noise floor of the spectrum. The two most common reasons that the amplitude will climb on direct-drive pump assemblies are due to misalignment or a damaged coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amplitude response on the spectrum is remarkably sensitive. A noticeable amplitude increase will occur with the incorrect key length in the hub. The common flexible-type couplings used will also show up when they fatigue, crack or become twisted. An example of a brittle flexible coupling with stress cracking is shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the follow-up test completed after a new coupler and laser alignment was performed. Notice the amplitude of the rotational speed peak at 30 Hz relative to the amplitude of the low-frequency product flow noise in each spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Pump Assembly with Problem&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 6. Pump Assembly Repaired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Demodulation Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another common frequency found in a demodulated current spectrum is the pump vane pass and fan blade pass frequency. This will help to trend and locate problems with the impeller or flow restrictions. In a demodulated current spectrum, it is calculated by using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Vane pass = pole pass frequency x # of vanes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the growth of the technology, knowledge and software advancements, locating bearing faults, gear mesh and other mechanical frequencies with MCSA will also become more common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Incorporating into a PdM program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all that demodulated MCSA can do, there are still many questions as to how it will fit into and benefit a PdM program. Frequently asked questions might include: Why do I care about finding mechanical faults with a demodulated current signal if I can find them with technologies like vibration analysis or infrared thermography? How reliable is the data that is generated and can it take the place of vibration? How often should MCSA be completed on equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With any condition monitoring technology, there are strengths and weaknesses. Each technology applied will give a more complete view of the health of the equipment. For best results, it is recommended to complete MCSA at least quarterly. If a program is testing less frequently than this, the overall results of the motor testing program will be compromised. As with any technology, it is critical to have enough data to accurately trend the history of the machine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for MCSA technology looking for mechanical faults, there are many reasons why this can benefit a PdM program. For example, when it comes to belt and coupler problems, demodulation will give an earlier and often more accurate fault indication than vibration analysis. The amount of energy created by the early stages of this type of fault is relatively low. When belts or couplers begin to wear, it is often not noticed in a vibration spectrum until the fault is nearing catastrophic failure. A demodulated current spectrum has the ability to detect the fault early enough to provide plenty of time to plan and schedule the repairs. However, demodulated MCSA is not intended to take the place of a vibration program. It is best used as a complimentary technology to a good vibration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An added benefit of this technology would be in remote equipment locations or areas where equipment is not accessible during normal operations. On this type of equipment, visual inspections can be difficult, and the ability to perform vibration analysis is limited. Depending on the risk assessment, remote wiring transducers for vibration may be too costly. In this case, MCSA would work well due to the ability of the equipment to be tested from the motor control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of any strong PdM program is having the ability to verify a fault with more than one technology. This not only ensures the validity of the fault but also helps make a more accurate and precise repair recommendation. The importance of verification with a second technology is never more evident than on a critical piece of equipment that requires plant outages for repair. Demodulated MCSA brings an added dimension to this effort and has proven itself to be an invaluable tool for any PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/frEwzOdb6YM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>National Instruments Introduces New Vibration Measurement Software </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	National Instruments recently announced the latest version of its NI Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite software, which provides a comprehensive collection of analysis and signal processing tools for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) testing, machine condition monitoring (MCM) and audio test applications. Engineers can use the suite as stand-alone software or combine it with NI hardware and NI LabVIEW system design software to simplify test system development and control. With its new vibration data-logging functionality and other enhancements, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 helps engineers to more easily customize and automate any MCM or NVH test or monitoring application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The NI Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite is an integral part of our MCM applications,&amp;quot; said professor Jay Lee, director of the National Science Foundation&amp;#39;s Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems at the University of Cincinnati. &amp;quot;The suite has tremendously reduced system development time and has helped us achieve a variety of efficiencies throughout our machine analysis process.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 simplifies the development of MCM, NVH and audio measurement systems with several new features, including a ready-to-run data-logging virtual instrument that makes it possible for engineers to save data continuously or based on specific criteria such as triggers or time. Engineers can configure the data logger and run it as long as necessary for a variety of sensor types, including accelerometer, tachometer and proximity probes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The measurement suite also includes the Sound and Vibration Assistant, a stand-alone software module for quickly acquiring, analyzing and logging acoustic, noise and vibration data. Additionally, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite provides easy-to-use application examples for impact test and swept sine analysis. These enhancements for the 2011 version add flexibility and high-performance capabilities to a variety of sound and vibration measurement projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By integrating with LabVIEW, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 helps engineers increase test throughput with advanced parallel processing capabilities, among many other advantages of LabVIEW. LabVIEW 2011 can dramatically increase development efficiency through new engineering-specific libraries and its ability to interact with almost any hardware device. Together, LabVIEW and the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 help engineers integrate individual measurement types into a single, reconfigurable platform so they can do their jobs faster, better and at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Condition Monitoring on Drilling Platforms: A Case Study </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There are many types of drilling platforms used across the world. Figure 1 is an example of the different types of platforms that are used for oil or gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/8b9abf9d-7579-4bcf-b868-0661d4ab130d_Ludeca_fig 1.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 448px; height: 294px;" /&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/c2076ff4-d7ed-48d5-97d2-0103281ab63b_Ludeca_fig1a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 161px; height: 207px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 &amp;ndash; Types of Drilling Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A typical oil production platform is self-sufficient in its energy and water needs, housing electrical generation, water declinators and all of the equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating storage unit and/or tanker loading facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extraction of volatile substances under extreme pressure in a hostile environment means risk. Thus, accidents and tragedies occasionally occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring can detect machine failures ahead of time and thereby prevent machine failures that could result in extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/2722ea12-2db7-4566-9d02-fa632a2b87f5_Ludeca_fig2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 331px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most important machines to be monitored on drilling platforms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Drilling machines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Draw works&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mud pumps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sheaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thrusters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the drilling machine becomes inoperable, the platform can no longer complete its essential task of drilling. The drilling machines can be difficult to monitor for vibration, as the machine is variable speed, low rpm and variable loaded. When analyzing data on a drilling machine, many transient events occur during its operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/fa12bdfa-a158-4e76-9094-824e315d0c35_Ludeca_fig2a.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 333px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/1ed0d330-78c4-4f26-8944-ed1f8f28e0dc_Ludeca_fig 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 94px; height: 328px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Vibxpertvibration data collector by Ludeca was used to collect data on a DDM 750 AC 1M drilling machine at the workshop to check for factory acceptance. The Vibxpert allows for high-resolution time signal and spectrum measurements to be collected. The Vibxpert can collect more than 100,000 lines of resolution, which allows for the Vibxpert to capture any transient events that might occur. The vibration data was collected while there was no load on the machine. The main shaft speed was 216 rpm, and the motor itself was turning 1762 rpm. The red &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;s in Figure 4 indicate where vibration data was collected on the DDM 750 AC 1M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/ff4eb65d-096b-4958-8119-b6efaf651cda_Ludeca_fig 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 407px; height: 462px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: DDM 750 AC 1M Drilling Machine: Vibration Data Collection Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the vibration data was collected, the data was transferred back into the Omnitrendsoftware for analyzing. Vibration analysis on the machine during the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) detected impacts from the cage (train) in the pinion upper bearing. The defect is shown on both the time waveform and the envelope FFT as depicted in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/e813462c-5431-4716-a700-a573164402d0_Ludeca_5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 607px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Omnitrend SW Time Waveform plot and envelope FFT before Corrective Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the vibration defect patterns, the factory decided to replace the bearings before the DDM 750 AC 1M was shipped to the customer. Once the new bearings were installed, additional vibration data was collected. The blue data is the latest vibration data collected. The bearing issue has been corrected by replacing the defective bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/30/31e5fe9b-4e99-413f-a2b3-2b670db8c135_Ludeca_fig 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 588px; height: 437px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Omnitrend SW Time Waveform plot and envelope FFT after Corrective Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many defects were noted on the bearing once it was removed from the DDM 750 AC 1M. Wear was detected on the cage and pockets, and the inner race showed a grayish wear pattern with indentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conclusion: This is not a bearing you would want in a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

					A useful spectral tool for detecting broken rotor bars is the swirl effect, which occurs just below&amp;nbsp;the 5th harmonic of line frequency (300 Hz on a 60 Hz line frequency). Swirl peaks are a confirming tool for the pole-pass frequency sidebands around line frequency and occur at:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to laser align rotating shafts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video shows how to laser shaft align rotating shafts as quickly as possible with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;True Position Sensing&amp;quot;, available on the Fixturlaser XA and the Fixturlaser GO. Laser shaft alignment with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s dual laser, dual sensor design means the system tracks the shafts&amp;#39; true positions, allowing alignments to often be completed with just one set of measurements and adjustments. The XA and GO laser shaft alignment tools are available in the United States from VibrAlign Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM software innovations lead to improved operating margins</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The current crop of predictive maintenance (PdM) management software now delivers instantaneous decision-making power for those engineers and plant managers charged with wringing the maximum utility from their facilities while conserving maintenance costs. Capable of instantly analyzing and interpreting vibration data &amp;ndash; along with ferrography, used-lubricant analysis and visual inspections &amp;ndash; today&amp;rsquo;s PdM software not only delivers integrated and prioritized information to plant managers in their offices, but throughout the entire organization via enterprise-wide &amp;ldquo;electronic in-trays,&amp;rdquo; text messages, pager alerts and even HTML pages accessible via a common Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Predicting the repair needs of critical components in lathes, mills, turbines, fans, drills, pumps and any other rotating device allows today&amp;rsquo;s MRO executives to control the destiny of their plant&amp;rsquo;s operations by preventing unexpected shutdowns in the first place. This ability to plan for the future is no longer the domain of Fortune 500 companies, as PdM software&amp;rsquo;s power to deliver answers, not merely data, has even trickled down to small and mid-sized businesses. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building upon the past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that plant engineers relied on run-to-fail (RTF) maintenance schedules &amp;ndash; a method that almost guaranteed unscheduled process line shutdowns. Hardly satisfactory, the maintenance industry welcomed advances in computerization as a means to help prevent expensive machine breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we started out doing machine condition analysis for the U.S. Navy back in 1966, the vibration work was all manual,&amp;rdquo; recalls Dean Lofall, the product development manager for Woburn, Mass.-based Azima DLI, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced suppliers of vibration analysis instruments and PdM programs. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d have a group of engineers that went out on the ship for 10 days to gather all the measurements via analog instrumentation tape recordings. It would then be played back by technicians through a processor to produce a five-foot high stack of graphs. For the next three weeks, a group of engineers would go through all the data, manually categorizing all the machinery and making specific repair recommendations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even the private sector &amp;ldquo;made do&amp;rdquo; with rudimentary results while absorbing huge manpower expenses. Automakers and power companies, for example, would maintain vast banks of vibration experts for the sole purpose of tracking machine life. Perhaps the persistent vision of massive mainframes crunching data from cumbersome Winchester drives possibly accounts for the reluctance of some individuals to believe that today&amp;rsquo;s basic PdM software can run on nothing more than a first-generation Pentium desktop computer. Yet, given the comparative low cost of entry and the gains to be had, maintenance managers of even small manufacturing facilities are now turning to full-featured PdM systems. Such are the advances that have been made over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s systems save money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Overly cautious, prevention-minded systems of the last decade wasted valuable maintenance resources by manually analyzing each piece of new data, whether the machines needed attention or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve observed that 80 percent of the machines in a typical plant will have no serious mechanical faults,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;So why waste time on machine parts that have no need for replacement? State-of-the-art predictiveprograms employ expert systems to weed out machine test-results that look acceptable; thus allowing analysts to focus only on those machines that may have faults. The time saved by not manually reviewing the data from every single machine in a plant is significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example: Some 30 years after its initial work for the Navy, Azima DLI deployed its expert system of PdM software to analyze data for thousands of machines within the U.S. Navy Sealift Command. A subsequent study of 332 such machines confirmed savings of between $47,000 and $62,000 per month, as opposed to manually calculating the data with in-house engineers. The accuracy rate proved to be 8 percent greater with the PdM system, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s PdM systems even predict the future of new equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Spectacular gains in maintenance efficiency and dollar savings have resulted from integrating modern PdM systems into existing facilities. Yet, the use of PdM to predict the useful life of brand newmachines promises to save organizations even more money. In recent years, DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Toledo North assembly plant avoided costly downtime by accurately predicting maintenance failures in newly purchased equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During the launch period of this new plant we requested evaluations via vibration analysis and infrared analysis as one of our buy-off criteria before we signed off on the equipment and took ownership,&amp;rdquo; recalls Terry Kulczak, the maintenance advisor for the Toledo plant. &amp;ldquo;We had already settled on the Azima DLI system for this task because we had good success with it at our Durango plant in Newark, Delaware.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kulczak explains that his team used their PdM system to evaluate more than 600 pieces of new equipment such as regenerative thermal oxidizer motors, water pumps, cooling fans and gearboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the software, we found that there were some machines out there that weren&amp;rsquo;t up to spec,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;Some had bad bearings, alignment problems and improperly sized shims, which led to excessive vibration. These had to be changed out, and it was all done under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At least 106 pieces of equipment needed adjustment or new parts. In his report to management, Kulczak estimated that the maintenance costs to repair these defects &amp;ndash; had they not been detected in advance &amp;ndash; would amount to at least $31,000, with a possible maximum cost of $112,000. Production losses due to failed machinery would have resulted in even greater losses to the plant&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The software analyzed the data and spit out the summary sheet, so you can go back into the data and decipher it a little more closely if you want,&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;From what I understand, older software out there did not have these features. A lot of the contractors questioned our calls, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t use DLI. But we showed them the data and it turns out we were right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains made possible through improved data collectors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The above-mentioned, bottom-line savings earned by investments in maintenance management have occurred through the continuous evolution of each element of the PdM chain. Progress has been achieved at every step, beginning with technological advances in field instrumentation that measures torsional vibration, torque and horsepower, motor current, structural vibration, shaft alignment, and acoustics with every increasing accuracy and fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even more important, an emphasis on portability has placed condition monitoring into the hands, literally, of production floor personnel. As proof, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX pen-tablet handheld computer can host a replica of an entire condition monitoring database &amp;ndash; capabilities previously reserved only for high-end desktops. With analysis tools and automated diagnostics onboard, the user enjoys a tremendous advantage in obtaining immediate answers while in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s versatile and portable data collection systems, we&amp;rsquo;re basically doing EKGs on machines,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Just like when you go to the doctor, an EKG will detect any early problems. Similarly, machines will give off precursors, or early indicators, of future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced processing tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next-greatest boon for plant managers can be attributed to the manner in which this data is now processed with almost real-time speed to deliver intelligent answers regarding machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s vibration analysis software uses an empirical, rule-based logic system that utilizes order-normalized data, spectrum analysis, cepstrum analysis, demodulated data analysis, and other proprietary algorithms to deliver information with an emphasis on providing a straightforward user interface. All data and functions are made available from a single-layer intuitive screen that is quickly organized via a built-in setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If you have a failing machine, then today&amp;rsquo;s software can tell you the severity with a hierarchy rating system, like a five out of 10,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll give you the actual fault or faults. It might be a bad roller bearing in addition to an imbalance. It should also tell you the repair recommendation based on whatever faults it finds. That is why the system is so useful to plant managers; they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to get into all the details. The system automatically does that for them by simply presenting credible information upon which they can base their decisions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real dollars-and-cents gains of utilizing PdM software come from employing these systems to continuously evaluate machine conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With continuous monitoring, an engineer can keep a much closer eye on operations, which brings about the real savings of predictive maintenance,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;For example, there always will be a small percentage of machines, say 4 to 5 percent, where you can see that it is not even going to last six months down the road. So you had better take care of any problems immediately. On the other hand, the most common thing we note is that most machines are running just fine. That&amp;rsquo;s important, because without such predictive information a lot of people would tear down the machine every three years just based on the calendar. But the PdM software would indicate that this machine is still doing fine; no repairs are needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains in integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While maintenance success stories rely on ever-more powerful data collection and process tools, the breakthrough benefits result from the integration of this important maintenance data into one seamless source of concise information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Voyager is an integrated environment that combines vibration analysis, used-lubricant analysis, infrared thermography libraries and even visual inspections (input via portable data collection instruments) to provide a single view of the maintenance status of a plant&amp;rsquo;s machinery. By utilizing one common platform to combine and compare various data sources, a cross-technology scoring can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This yields a prioritized ranking so that facility managers can schedule plant-wide repairs in order of urgency. Reports can be customized to include detailed plots and images to justify comprehensive, program-management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integration of PdM software recently proved itself at Tri-State Generation &amp;amp; Transmission&amp;rsquo;s Escalante generation station. Azima&amp;rsquo;s vibration diagnostic software, ExpertALERT for Voyager (EAV), recently saved Tri-State money by taking machines out of service for necessary repairs based on their condition instead of waiting until they fail, but it was the thorough dissemination of this information that helped make the program a success, according to Joe DeSoto, a results specialist at Tri-State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The DLI Diagnostic Data Collector includes EAV on a tablet-style computer platform that you can take out of the office,&amp;rdquo; says DeSoto. &amp;ldquo;It shows your maintenance people what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the machine in real time and helps explain where the problem is and why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeSoto stresses that providing such information on the production floor is crucial to gaining the confidence of the maintenance staff. Showing them ExpertALERT&amp;rsquo;s diagnostic capabilities in action helped develop trust in the tool throughout the facility and boosted the credibility of the entire PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All hardware products should use a common software and database platform, so they can pass along and process information seamlessly,&amp;rdquo; suggests Lofall. &amp;ldquo;However, establishing common lines of communication with the business system of any given plant is becoming just as important. This type of information-distribution is now expected in the very latest iterations of PdM software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In essence, the latest PdM communication tools excel at &amp;ldquo;bringing the mountain to Mohammed&amp;rdquo; by abstracting data from insular condition monitoring applications, and then placing it at the feet of maintenance decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rsquo;s new networking technologies offer more power and transparency,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;XML, OPC and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DCOM and .NET are breaking down the barriers of integration and distributed computing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, in conjunction with diagnostic software, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s online software permits facility managers to ascertain the status of wired machinery simply by logging onto their network to view real-time vibration data or obtain a complete diagnostic analysis. Under such topology, the online system is simply another node on the plant&amp;rsquo;s LAN. An Active-X component can even be installed on selected computers so that maintenance alert messages automatically pop-up on the screen. Additionally, electronic &amp;ldquo;in-trays&amp;rdquo; can be configured so that only the status of critical, process machines will be delivered to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Connectivity is a big part of making PdM pay for itself, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to have the information unless it gets to the right people,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Certainly, the bulk of managers still get written reports, but now we have the technology to send results over the Internet and through electronic wireless connections like digital cell phones and pagers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking things a step further, Azima DLI offers a unique means of distributing maintenance information by automatically generating machine status summaries in HTML, so that these pages can be accessed via a common Web browser. This allows a traveling engineer to determine machine status, even from outside the company WAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern PdM communication software also allows a significant amount of customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s systems, you could get the condition of a machine right on your digital pager or cell phone with a text message,&amp;rdquo; adds Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Or, you could set it up so that your cell phone would ring every time a machine of your particular interest, reached a critical state of maintenance need. To go another step further, different ring tones can be assigned to different incoming numbers, so an engineer can immediately tell which piece of equipment needs attention. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a matter of preference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These improvements in communication are even becoming available to small organizations that lack integrated business systems. Azima DLI, for instance, operates an online monitoring center on a 24/7 basis, providing worldwide coverage of wired machines. The monitoring program can be set up to deliver maintenance information over a wide range of time frames, from monthly reports all the way to immediate-alert messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	And so, the story of PdM has come a long way from the early days of RTF. Innovative PdM tools now help engineers accurately track the condition of their assets, whether they&amp;rsquo;re using a stand-alone PC system in a small job shop or an enterprise-wide system for a multi-plant industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Kulczak summed up the modern state of affairs when he observed, &amp;ldquo;RTF is not only just a memory, but an impossibility here. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t afford to do that. For us, PdM software proved to be a very useful tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because today&amp;rsquo;s modern PdM systems enable increased uptime, energy savings, and reduced maintenance costs for organizations of all sizes, it has earned recognition as a contributor to profitability. Those plant engineers who have taken the next step from time-based or reactive drills to proactive condition-based planning on both existing and newequipment, are laying the groundwork for even further advances within the field of maintenance management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Machinery Health Monitor combines vibration and temperature monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management announces the addition of a unique temperature module for the CSI 6500 Machinery Health Monitor. The new A6630 temperature module complements the vibration monitoring capabilities already available in the CSI 6500 and delivers critical bearing temperature measurements. The A6630 module accepts RTD and thermocouple signals directly, reducing the installation cost and complexity of temperature monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether striving for uptime, machinery protection, or safety, temperature is an important parameter when monitoring critical turbomachinery, compressors and steam turbine generators. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		After overspeed, thrust is the most important protection measurement. When only two thrust position sensors are implemented, monitoring thrust bearing temperature provides an additional level of confidence for identifying early thrust bearing wear and machine malfunctions, and results in fewer missed trips.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In journal bearings, temperature measurements complement the radial vibration monitoring to help confirm bearing rubs and lube oil issues, allowing for scheduling of repairs during normally planned outages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By simplifying the hardware for monitoring bearing temperature, more users are able to take advantage of these critical measurements,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Humes, general manager for Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Machinery Health Management business. &amp;ldquo;The combination of vibration and temperature monitoring enables plant personnel to make informed decisions that can increase the safety and profitability of their facility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In keeping with the API 670 specification, the A6630 has six or fewer channels per module, 4-20mA outputs, and includes relay logic for voting and automatic machine trips.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the CSI 6630 is hot swappable and supports the Easy Integration feature for fast connection to the DeltaV and Ovation process automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Emerson Process Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Emerson Process Management, an Emerson business, is a leader in helping businesses automate their production, processing and distribution in the chemical, oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, power, water and wastewater treatment, mining and metals, food and beverage, life sciences and other industries.

            <title>How a Nucor mill benefits from condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last several years, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s integrated monitoring and diagnostics solution has been applied extensively at Nucor Steel&amp;rsquo;s Hickman Sheet Mill. Automated data collection has been introduced and applied in concert with established traditional manual condition monitoring programs at the mill. Data collected from both methods is interpreted and displayed via a single Web portal and diagnostics are performed remotely by Azima analysts. This article describes the justification, development, application and benefits of such an integrated solution. Specific case studies will be presented along with discussions of deployment issues and barriers that have been overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition Monitoring Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition monitoring, commonly referred to as predictive maintenance, is a proven approach to improving reliability and productivity in industry. Its underlying philosophy is that technology can be used to measure and evaluate the condition of plant assets and equipment, thus enabling intelligent decisions to be made about maintenance activity. In this manner, maintenance is applied to the assets that need attention, while those whose performance and condition are determined to be normal are left alone to perform productive roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The initial application of condition monitoring was in the utility and petrochemical industries in the 1970s. During this period, tremendous plant expansions and constructions were taking place, and plant scale increased dramatically. Instead of being dependent on many small machines, plant train size and capacity were such that a typical refinery or large generating plant became absolutely dependent on a very few, very large and very expensive capital machines. The loss of one of these capital assets (primarily rotating machinery) to mechanical failure could (and did) result in major income losses and, in the case of some the larger petrochemical plants, actual disruptions in markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This reality resulted in the development of fault protection systems (warning/trip systems based on vibration analysis) for protecting rotating capital machinery from catastrophic failure. These fault protection systems proved very successful in preventing crashes and limiting the damage from machine failure. These systems were soon institutionalized and standards (API, etc.) were developed and accepted throughout the appropriate industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the success of fault protection systems, many plant operators began to suspect that similar approaches could be applied to the myriad of smaller machines in the plant. Even though the failure of one of these smaller machines could not itself shut down a plant, the aggregate cost of repairs on these machines made the application of condition monitoring an attractive prospect in a typical refinery or chemical plant. However, the high per-machine cost of applying a fault protection system prohibited this from becoming a reality. Instead, technology responded with the development of portable measurement instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning with simple meters, manual log sheets and trending, machine surveillance programs were born. Beginning in the late 1980s, the explosion of PC/computer technology drove the development of computerized manual data collection systems which rapidly gained success in the plant maintenance market. In very short order, the use of &amp;ldquo;data collector&amp;rdquo; systems &amp;ndash; programmable black boxes with well-defined measurement capabilities &amp;ndash; spread to many industries, including the steel industry. A &amp;ldquo;route&amp;rdquo; defining the machines to be measured and the specific measurements to be taken was created in PC-based software and downloaded to the data collector. Personnel would go out into the plant to collect data with the device and then upload the data. This data would then be analyzed and a report was issued recommending appropriate maintenance actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the tremendous advances in data processing technology, these so-called &amp;ldquo;walk-around systems&amp;rdquo; have progressed to the point where the limit is no longer measurement technology. Megabytes of machine condition data can be gathered in a day, with relatively low skill requirements. This approach represents the status quo to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Contentional&amp;rsquo; Walk-around Data Collection &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Current data collector systems are very powerful and represent near-miraculous improvements over the initial 1980s systems. Modern data collectors are intended primarily to collect rotating machinery vibration data (although other scalar and non-dynamic data, including manual observations and comments can typically be entered). The accompanying software enables the presentation of the collected data for analysis. This software typically supports the incorporation of other external data, such as infrared thermography and lubricant analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical EAF/mini-mill environment, the actual execution and responsibility for such a walk-around vibration program resides either in-house or with outside contract resources. A typical AF/mini-mill with an associated cold mill may have 500 to 600 individual machines under monitoring/surveillance via data collector/walk-around methods, with somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 individual measurements being taken each month. This represents, under typical conditions, about one to two man-weeks of measurement effort alone. Data analysis typically consumes another man-week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s manual data collector systems have reached a near-zenith in efficiency. Early on (late 1980s), processing technology in microprocessors and memory limited their performance and, depending on the measurements to be taken, the technician analyst was often waiting for the data collector to do a given task. As such, his efficiency was limited. Processing technology today has advanced to the point where the required sample times and the fundamental mathematics of data digitization are the time limit, rather than the performance of hardware and software. It is not reasonable to expect any significant gains in terms of data collection time due to measurement technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a manual data collection program, achieving a load factor (time spent actually taking measurements as opposed to traveling from point to point, uploading and downloading data, etc.) of 60 to 70 percent is a significant achievement. It is not unusual for the data collection portion of a condition monitoring to consume 70 percent or more of recurring operating/labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is, of course, only part of the process of executing a successful condition monitoring program. Data analysis, screening processes and reporting are essential to achieving cost reductions and improvements in uptime. In most cases, the availability and skill of personnel with the proper experience and training are the governing factors in the success of a condition monitoring program. Collecting data is not hard; making the appropriate use of the data is much more difficult to achieve consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite very capable measurement technology, condition monitoring success in a given plant is still dependent on the ability to gather and correctly interpret data from the plant machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manual data collection processes, even in the presence of efficient data collection and skilled analysis, are still snapshot in nature and may not reflect the actual operating conditions that plant equipment experience. This is because there are more day-to-day variations in data than is revealed by a monthly collection route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historically, the steel industry has been willing to adopt condition monitoring as a means of improving mill productivity, and many successful programs are extant in mills. Whether contracted out or executed in-house, the same issues governing successful implementation of a condition monitoring program exist. The most difficult issue is retention of the appropriate skills and experience in the condition monitoring role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to be successful an individual must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be very conversant with rotating machinery and machine components &amp;ndash; the individual has to understand couplings, bearings and gears, machine dynamics (at least at some basic level), and the factors that affect machine wear and tear.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be at least conversant with (or be able and willing to be trained in) more esoteric concepts like spectrum analysis, frequency analysis, phase, modulation, etc., and have sufficient understanding of some basic concepts that normally are not part of the vocabulary of an individual with the requisite mechanical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be competent with computer technology, at least to the level of an advanced application user &amp;ndash; all of the current condition monitoring technologies involve computer usage to a very large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be a skilled communicator. Clearly explaining the reasoning behind a given recommendation is a key and often overlooked requirement for a successful condition monitoring program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be willing (or have personnel that are willing) to routinely do hot, dirty, repetitive data collection work, that typically involves difficult-to-access or hazardous areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not hard to understand why maintaining the appropriate people resources, whether in-house or contracted out, is difficult to achieve over the long haul. In the developing years of condition monitoring technology (late 1970s to early 1990s), most plants, regardless of size, had one or two (sometimes many more) resources devoted to condition monitoring programs. This supply led to an effective &amp;ldquo;farm club&amp;rdquo; system that supplied experienced personnel to both the in-the-plant programs and outside contract/consultant sources. Changes in plant manning, personnel and position rotations, and retirements have resulted in a situation where the availability of such personnel is limited and shrinking, and the cost of those workers is rising. The decline in the availability of human resources with the appropriate experience and skill sets has led to the exploration of ways to bring the data to the analyst. In this manner, a person with the requisite skills can cover far more industrial real estate than would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Remove Monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the late 1970s, adoption of automation for plant and process control and communication has risen substantially both in complexity and market acceptance. Computers on every desk and in every control room are now the norm. Mills and plants typically have very sophisticated and extensive IT networks for both administrative and process control/automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First approaches in many diverse industries involved transmission of machine-condition-related data to existing Man-Machine Interface (MMI)/Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems. Particularly, existing machinery protection (warning and trip) systems were tied into control room HMI/MMI interfaces so that operators could view vibration, temperature and other machine condition parameters. Typically, these were magnitude-only scalar values, which &amp;ndash; while valuable in terms of information and indication of possible machine problems &amp;ndash; were lacking in terms of trending, analysis and data interpretation capabilities. Plant personnel were thus receiving information that a given machine was vibrating more, or a bearing temperature was going up, etc. This left open the question of why these changes were occurring, and how the plant should react to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advances in technology, the Internet and the need to more efficiently monitor machinery with limited personnel drove the development of expanded remote monitoring systems. Rather than delivering machine data in-house only (to the control room, etc.), technology and the Internet enable information to be accessed from anywhere, anytime. This new method uses field-mounted sensing devices and instruments, some sort of aggregating devices, advanced software, and access to plant and external networks for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits of such a system are apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More frequent monitoring of machinery without a need for data collection/analysis personnel to be present, as well as the ability to observe dynamic changes in machine condition due to load, speed and operating conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to move data off-site for remote consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to have multiple resources in multiple locations looking at data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to monitor parameters other than what would normally be monitored in a traditional manual program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to assess machine performance in terms of efficiency, throughput, etc., and relate that data to machine condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Condition Monitoring at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman has had a condition monitoring program in place for more than 10 years. The program was based around traditional manual survey methodology and techniques, and was provided by outside contract resources. Data was collected on equipment across the mill on a monthly basis, with frequent callouts for troubleshooting and analysis of specific problems. After data collection, analysis was performed and written reports with recommendations were disseminated to appropriate mill personnel. All systems in the mill (environmental, hot mill, casters and melt shop) were included. In 1998, Nucor Hickman added a cold mill facility, with pickling line, galvanizing line, RT mill and annealing capability. The traditional monitoring program was expanded (nearly doubled) to include this portion of the mill. After the integration of the cold mill into the program, 590 machines were under monthly surveillance. A typical survey required two to three man-weeks to complete by manual methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As early forms of remote data collection and analysis methods became available, opportunities rose where remote monitoring might be practical and beneficial. In the first case, caster mold water cooling pumps, which had traditionally been a maintenance problem, became a potential application due to changes in operating conditions. The mold water pump installation at Nucor Hickman at that point consisted of three 700-horsepower opposed suction centrifugal pumps, direct coupled to induction motor drivers. In typical operations, two pumps were in service and one maintained as in inline spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operational requirements dictated a need for increased mold water flow, and all three pumps were placed in service. This had a negative impact in terms of pump vibration levels and reduced confidence in pump reliability. There was no remaining spare capacity (the standby pump was now in continuous service), making the impact of a pump failure significant. Nucor Hickman decided to apply some of the early remote, Internet-based monitoring technologies to the pumps. Expected benefits were closer-to-real-time problem detection and better understanding of the pumps&amp;rsquo; vibration behavior. In addition, a current sensor was added to the systems on each motor, which would allow monitoring of system load in parallel with pump and motor vibration on each of the pumps. The system would report bearing temperatures, vibration magnitudes, discharge pressures, current magnitudes and frequency content/time domain vibration data from each pump. This data was available to contractor analysis personnel, who were responsible for monitoring the pumps&amp;rsquo; behavior, and also to plant personnel. In addition, the data was available over the Web, making it accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection. Multiple users could access the system at the same time from multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Internet-based monitoring system was installed with data being collected much more frequently and under different operational conditions. Within days of commissioning the online remote system, it was obvious that the vibration behavior of the pumps varied much more widely than had been indicated by the once-per-month data. This is because monthly data &amp;ndash; even several years worth of it &amp;ndash; was simply insufficient to notice it. The frequent collection enabled by the automated system clearly showed 3:1 variations over different operational modes. In addition, load current data (which was not available from the traditional once/month data) indicated that the pumps were typically not loaded nearly to capacity, and were operating well off curve. As a result, an engineering study of the pump systems and operation was commissioned. The study concluded that sizing errors, control strategies and piping configurations were incorrect for the desired operating conditions. The pumps were resized and other changes were put in place to provide the desired increased flow. This provided spare capacity without the need to run all three pumps, and contributed materially to improved cooling and mold life. It is highly unlikely that these issues would have come to light without the data provided by the remote monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further applications of remote monitoring technology were installed on baghouse ID fans and utility air compressors in the hot mill. The hot mill air compressors are three-stage centrifugal machines, directly driven by two-pole induction motors. The compressors and motors were on monthly surveillance and were subject to frequent bearing failures in the drive motors. Once-per-month data was catching bearing failures often, but trends were erratic and no clear root cause was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When remote monitoring technology was applied, it became clear that &amp;ndash; as with the mold water pumps &amp;ndash; the vibration levels were varying much more than had been apparent from the monthly manual data. It was also clear that the variations had a pattern that closely tracked ambient temperatures. Since bearing temperatures also were being monitored, it was clear that when ambient temperature went up, vibration levels increased dramatically. Analysis of the frequency content provided by the remote monitoring system clearly indicated that the cause of the increase in vibration was imbalance in the motor rotors. Further review of bearing wear patterns indicated an extreme thrust load was being placed on the motor&amp;rsquo;s radial Conrad-type ball bearings. From this, it became apparent that at high temperatures the motor rotor was expanding axially and there was insufficient clearance in the motor bearing fits to allow for this expansion, causing rotor bow (hence the imbalance) and axial overload of the motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of this discovery, the compressor drive motors were replaced with an alternate design. Vibration levels, as reported by the remote monitoring system, remained low and reliability dramatically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the cold mill at Hickman, the RT mill stand drives were equipped with four 5,000 HP synchronous motors. The motors were journal bearing machines and were not reliable. Thrusting and resultant bearing failures, along with pole piece electrical failures, led to the 2004 installation of a warning and trip system based on proximity probes on the motors and accelerometers on the mill gearboxes. This system not only supplied warning and trip capability, but also provided near real-time vibration data, including shaft orbits, to analysis personnel outside the mill. Remote analysis personnel could be hundreds of miles away, viewing near-real-time data, and consulting directly with pulpit operators on problems with the mill stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these and other successes, it was clear that remote machinery monitoring offered improvements and capabilities not provided by conventional means. However, this early system did have limitations. It relied on serial RS-485 communications with a scanner/site server. As the system expanded, sampling rates slowed down and the most recent data was not available in a timely fashion. It also used proprietary sensors, which limited configurability and flexibility of application. The system on the RT mill, while powerful, was expensive and was limited to one user at a time due to its use of VPN technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in late 2004 and early 2005, Nucor Hickman undertook deployment of wireless technology in the mill. The justification was shipping and inventory applications, cranes and systems in the hot mill, and to meet other operational requirements. At the same time, improved remote monitoring technology was coming on the market using the same wireless protocols. This new remote monitoring technology, developed by Azima DLI, used commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, standard networking protocols, and was much more flexible in terms of software and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The convergence of wireless technology, its application in the mill, and the availability of improved technology all drove expansion of Nucor Hickman&amp;rsquo;s remote equipment monitoring. It is interesting to note that the wireless implementation and deployment was justified by other applications within the mill. The impact of the machinery monitoring data on the network has been minimal, and even with the extensive deployment at Nucor Hickman, represents a tiny fraction of network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nucor Hickman: Largest Remote Monitoring Deployment in the U.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As of the publication of this article, the Nucor Hickman Sheet Mill was the site of the largest dynamic signal remote monitoring deployment in the United States. Azima remote monitoring technology is used on all mill cooling towers, all baghouse ID fans, all baghouse reverse air fans, caster mold water pumps, caster spray water pumps, all descale pumps, roof feed flux system aspiration fans, and mill air compressors. Remote monitoring system installation is underway on mill emergency generator sets, and is planned for the near future shape tension rolls in the cold mill. Approximately 280 sensors are remotely monitored. Mill personnel have full access to data, alert histories, alarms and warnings, reports and report/machine histories. Alerts are transmitted by e-mail and/or cell phone SMS text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system currently applied at Nucor Hickman communicates through the plant network either via 802.11b wireless technology or via standard Ethernet (unlike earlier systems, which required serial RS-485 communication). A single small site server (standard PC) is located at the plant to act as a data gateway and buffering device. If connectivity out of the mill is lost, the site server acts as a data storage device buffering data until connectivity is restored. One of the key features is that the monitoring application requires no software on the target client PC &amp;ndash; all that is required is Internet access and a login for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of sensors mounted on the target machine and a sensor hub that digitizes and aggregates data from the sensors. Collected data is transmitted securely to the plant network via either 802.11b wireless or Ethernet. (Note that, although not currently employed at Nucor Hickman, the system also supports data transmission via a cellular interface, independent of the plant network.)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. How the Azima DLI Remote Monitoring System Works at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data is sent via the plant network to the local site server and then out over the Internet to Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s remote servers. Plant personnel, analysts or other authorized parties can then access the system via a secure Web portal. Access and privileges are controlled by double password, and depending on privileges, a user can have rights to view data, edit system settings, analyze data and/or issue reports. All data, alerts and alert histories, and reports generated by analysts are maintained on the Web portal. Histories of reports generated can be sorted and searched by plant area, date, machine, fault type and other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the number of remotely monitored machines continues to expand at Nucor Hickman, many less critical machines remain under manual surveillance by operators on rounds once a month. These machines include those in the balance of plant (hydraulic pumps, roll stand cooling pumps, furnace cooling pumps, and so forth). This monthly data is fed into the Azima DLI system and displayed via the same secure Web interface as the remotely collected data. This means that a mill-wide view of equipment health &amp;ndash; from all monitored machines, regardless of collection method &amp;ndash; is visible via a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima analysts are responsible for monitoring and analyzing all posted to the Web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Involved in Getting Remote Monitoring Started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the most attractive features of the remote monitoring system at Hickman is that it is comprised primarily of low-cost, commercially available components (for example, COTS sensors) combined with advanced software and specialized sensor hubs. Careful planning and forethought is needed to ensure a successful remote monitoring deployment. Some of the lessons learned include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Careful thought should be given as to which machines are to be monitored and in what manner. In the case of Hickman, although the condition monitoring contractor had overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the system, and for disseminating the analysis and results there from, each individual mill area had to decide what was to be monitored and how. Reporting relationships, access and other issues were all discussed and defined well ahead of the installation of monitoring equipment. There was a clear list of which equipment would benefit from automated remote monitoring and which could be sufficiently monitored by conventional methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of points per machine to be monitored is an important consideration. Simply mimicking what would have been done in a manual monitoring program (multiple points and measurements per bearing) is usually unnecessary and adds cost while delivering small incremental value.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If wireless transmission is to be employed, determine the best protocol for the site: 802.11b/g, ZigBee, or 900 megahertz. In the case of Hickman, 802.11b was the preferred choice and that has been universally true in other applications as well. It offers the widest selection of available devices, and can cover a wide area with just a few access points. The 802.11b protocol has proven to be very reliable and is immune to RF interference, even in the melt shop area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve IT early. Agreement needs to be reached on security, protocols, etc. well before the installation of a remote monitoring system. What are the mill&amp;rsquo;s security expectations and policies? Within the plant, is traditional Local Area Network (LAN) acceptable, or is a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) necessary? IT support during deployment is crucial to successful and efficient startup. Connectivity must be verified, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Remote Monitoring Benefits Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The initial deployment of the current generation of remote machinery monitoring technology commenced in July 2005. The installation and commissioning of Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring system is continuing to expand. The hybrid approach of monitoring critical machines in parallel with traditional manual walk-around monitoring of balance-of-plant equipment, all reported via a common Web-based portal, has provided solid value to Nucor Hickman personnel. Several case studies demonstrating this value are briefly detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 1: Failure Caught Without Site Visit or Increased Costs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the spring of 2006, a 1,500 HP baghouse fan induction motor failed due to a sudden stator short failure. All of the baghouse fans were equipped with remote monitoring hubs and were under surveillance. The motor was replaced with a rebuilt spare. Immediately on restart of the fan, much higher vibration levels were noted by the remote monitoring analyst (who was not on site). Mill environmental department personnel, who were responsible for the baghouse and its equipment, were notified of the increased vibration. Further examination of the data identified the problem as an outer race defect on the inboard (drive end) bearing of the motor. Mill personnel requested an evaluation as to the likelihood of the motor continuing in service until the next maintenance outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analysis of the data and the rate of change indicated that it was likely that the unit would indeed continue to run. In an attempt to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, attempts at relubrication of the motor bearing were undertaken. Unfortunately, the relubrication actually increased the vibration, and the rate of deterioration increased dramatically. Mill personnel were advised of the change, and monitoring surveillance increased (frequency of data collection can be increased remotely via the Azima system&amp;rsquo;s interface). The unit continued to deteriorate and, by the weekend, had reached a stage wherein continued operation was questionable. A recommendation was made to remove the unit from service at the first opportunity. After mutual viewing of the data and trends by plant personnel in conference with the remote analyst, plant personnel decided to remove the unit from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A spare fan was placed in service while the motor replacement was undertaken. The spare fan also was equipped with sensors that reported to the Azima system. Prior to beginning disassembly of the failed fan, the spare was restarted and vibration and performance data was reviewed by the remote analyst, who confirmed that the spare fan was running well and could be expected to give reliable service while the failed fan was repaired. Only after the confirmation of the health of the spare was the failed fan removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that at no time during this episode was the equipment analyst on site at the mill. Problem detection, confirmation of the problem and diagnostics (including the condition assessment of the spare fan) were all conducted remotely with no site visits and no costs incurred. In the case of the confirmation of the condition of the spare fan, the contractor analyst was in an airport hundreds of miles away and was still able to serve the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unlikely that this level of detection, service and continued operation could have been achieved with conventional once/month survey method. Using conventional methods, it is likely that several site visits would have been required with extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/394552f5-f4a2-4740-b552-559d87eacac7_Nucor Hickman_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Trend Graph Showing Vibration Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 2: Air Compressor Runs the Last Mile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A centrifugal induction motor-driven air compressor had suffered from poor reliability for some time. Beginning in the spring of 2006, it was equipped with remote monitoring technology. Immediately upon installation of the system, dramatic variations in motor vibration level with compressor load were noted. Remotely acquired and analyzed vibration data indicated that bearing fits were in poor condition, and that the spacer gear coupling associated with this compressor was partially locked up. A recommendation was made to not yet remove the unit from service, but rather to continue to run and monitor it while preparations for a repair were made. Data also was provided to the motor repair vendor. The motor repair vendor concurred that the vibration data indicated a problem but that it was likely confined to the coupling. The recommendation was made by the motor repair vendor to disconnect the coupling, run the motor solo, and take manual measurements to confirm the coupling problem. The coupling was disconnected, the motor was run solo and manual vibration measurements were undertaken. The motor was actually worse in the uncoupled condition, and before the vibration measurements could be completed, the motor failed catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the motor repair was completed and the unit returned to service, the remote monitoring system was recommissioned and was able to confirm that the motor and compressor were in good condition and suitable for continued service. This condition persisted for several months, with the unit running well and remote monitoring continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, following a mill outage, the compressor motor vibration exhibited a small but unmistakable increase in overall vibration on the motor. The melt shop personnel were notified and the recommendation was made to continue to run the compressor. Monitoring frequency was increased and alert thresholds adjusted to compensate for the changes. No site visits were required and the increased monitoring and adjustments were accomplished remotely via the system&amp;rsquo;s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few weeks later, the adjusted alert levels were exceeded, and automated alerts were issued. No other changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few more weeks, the steady trend upward in motor vibration continued. Plant personnel were continuously advised as to the deteriorating condition of the unit, as was the motor repair vendor. Finally, the deterioration reached a level where the remote analyst recommended removing the unit from service at the convenient opportunity. The motor repair vendor sent personnel to the site to take manual vibration measurements on the motor. The manual measurements confirmed the problem and the unit was removed from service and sent out for repair. A coupling issue and deterioration of the inboard motor bearing was confirmed. Again, no site visits by analysis personnel were required and the plant was able to &amp;ldquo;run the unit the last mile&amp;rdquo; without incurring catastrophic failure or mill outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/46d29376-fd1c-4a99-999f-5fa8c7feb97e_Nucor Hickman_3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 3: Remote Monitoring Enables System-Wide Process Optimization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A remote monitoring system can, as in the cases above, greatly expand on the capabilities of conventional rotating machinery vibration analysis. What many do not realize is that remote monitoring technology can also contribute in ways that are not possible with conventional manual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The baghouse fans at NUCOR Hickman are vital to the plant. Maintenance of plant productivity, while still staying within permitted emission limits, is essential to plant profitability. Operating costs (in terms of power consumption) for several thousand horsepower of fan drives is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring system, as applied to the baghouse fans at Hickman, incorporates vibration measurements along with load current measurements. Sampling rates are very rapid, and the baghouse fans at Hickman have an essentially unity power factor. The fan motors are not individually metered at the MCCs. With the rapid sampling of the remote monitoring system, however, it became possible to get a reasonably accurate measure of fan load and operating cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after commissioning the baghouse fan remote monitoring system, is was seen that variations in fan load and fan vibration were, not surprisingly, directly related to tap-to-tap cycles of the EAFs. All of the fans take suction from a common plenum, which is in turn fed by the furnace and canopy ducts. Data collected by the remote monitoring system allowed observation of the dynamics of fan load as the melt shop underwent normal operation cycles. The ability to average and integrate the load data unexpectedly revealed that significant variation in fan HP load existed not only during furnace cycles but from one fan to another. The data indicated a several-thousand-dollars-per-month variation in the operating cost of the fans. After data review, it became apparent that there was significant temperature (and thus density and mass flow) variation from one fan to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The variation in load was confirmed by temperature measurements and infrared thermographic observation of the change in duct temperatures over time. Poor distribution in the plenum has been partially corrected by installing turning vanes in the plenum and adjusting damper control strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material improvements in fan efficiency have been realized as a result of these actions. The remote monitoring system allowed quantification of these issues and the ability to directly measure the effects of corrective action. This would not have been possible with conventional machinery monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman is embracing new remote monitoring technologies and integrating them with its existing manual data collection process. By determining the most effective monitoring method for each machine &amp;ndash; based on level of criticality, history of problems, and so forth &amp;ndash; Nucor has established a comprehensive monitoring program that delivers increased uptime, reduced safety risks, and lower maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By choosing the Azima DLI monitoring and diagnostics system, Nucor has installed a flexible system that supports the integration of data collected both by automated system and manual rounds. All data is presented via a single, secure Web interface. This enables mill-wide alerts to potential problems and delivers critical data to remotely located Azima analysts for review, analysis and advice. In addition to providing more comprehensive monitoring, Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring solution has reduced the demand on existing resources at Nucor Hickman and frees them up to focus on maintenance rather than data collection. The program has been successful to date at Hickman, with clear successes and benefits, and further expansion is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As with most technological pursuits the real reason for success is people. We wish to offer sincerest thanks to the team at Nucor Hickman. The manager of the environmental department, Wayne Turney, and the department supervisor, Dan Bullock, have been particularly instrumental in the ongoing implementation. Dave DaVolt, Rod Wycoff, Claude Riggin, Justin Smith, Ashley Tippet, Tom Wright and Lou Incrocci in the hot mill, cold mill and melt shop have all contributed to the successful demonstration of these technologies. Likewise, success would have been impossible without the support, expert advice and consultation from the Nucor Hickman IT group. Rudy Moser, department manager, and Jim Walmsley, network support, were essential in making the implementation a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the part of Azima DLI, Dr. Ed Futcher and his development team created the tools to make the systems possible, and Heather De Jes&amp;uacute;s and Dave Geswein, Azima engineering, deployed the system at the mill. Nelson A. Baxter, vice president of diagnostics for Azima, was invaluable in technical support and expertise. Elsa Anzalone, account manager for Azima, made the case for what has been achieved in this project, and her contributions have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using vibration analysis to test for bearing wear</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This article discusses an example of an outer race-bearing defect on a 1,250-ton (4,400-kilowatt) air-conditioning chiller. The defect was detected using off-the-shelf portable vibration analysis hardware and software. The machine is a single-stage centrifugal compressor with a rolling element thrust bearing on the motor free end and a sleeve bearing on the motor drive end. This article discusses methods used to diagnose and trend the bearing defect using vibration spectra as an indicator of the bearing condition. The diagnostic methods covered are universally applicable to other types of machines (pumps, fans, gears) with rolling contact bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis Tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tools used to measure vibration have improved significantly in the past 25 years. The sensor of choice for most vibration data collection on industrial machinery is an accelerometer. As the name implies, the output is proportional to acceleration; however, it is normally integrated to display in units of velocity. All data shown in this case history was collected using a triaxial accelerometer cluster shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/32a4ba93-28b7-4c13-bece-0e067afea934_bearing1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/d80b5c95-094a-40b9-b1da-1f589f348625_bearing2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Sketch of a triaxial accelerometer cluster (left) that is stud-mounted to the bronze disk mounting pad (bottom right). The cluster contains three accelerometers, each mutually perpendicular to the others. Vibration data collection is activated using a bar code that automatically sets up the data collector, collects and then stores the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The notched mounting pad is adhered rigidly to the motor bearing housing, and the triaxial cluster is stud-mounted, allowing all three axes to be collected simultaneously. The bar code and mounting configuration allow accurate and repeatable data to be collected every time, regardless of the skill of the person doing the data collection. As long as the test conditions are relatively consistent, the test data also should be consistent if the mechanical condition remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The signal processing techniques used by a vibration analyst vary based on the level of detail desired. In routine predictive maintenance programs, two types of data typically are collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Overall level: &lt;/strong&gt;The overall level is a measure of the total vibration amplitude over a wide range of frequencies. An overall vibration measurement, also called a broadband level, is a single value that is relatively easy and cheap to collect, process, analyze and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Narrowband: &lt;/strong&gt;Using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the vibration signal is resolved into a number of discrete frequencies and displayed as a two-dimensional spectral plot of amplitude vs. frequency. All of the triaxial spectra shown in this case history have a frequency scale with 800 lines of resolution. In other words, each spectrum is composed of 800 individual peaks defining an amplitude at a specific frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Acceptance Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is an acceptable level of vibration for the 1,250-ton (4400-kW) chiller? The chiller manufacturer uses a pass/fail broadband specification of 0.25 inches/second (peak). Vibration tolerances or specifications typically are expressed as either absolute or relative criteria. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart, summarized in Table 1, is the most common example of absolute criteria and is a good guide for engineers who do not have any historical data on a machine. Each increment of machinery condition is represented by change of a factor of two in the vibration velocity. A third column provides an easy conversion between inches/second (peak) and the commonly used logarithmic unit of velocity decibels (VdB). Note that 6 dB also represents a change by a factor of two, so each machinery condition band is represented by a 6 dB differential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart is an improvement on a pass/fail criteria such as that used by the chiller manufacturer because it provides a graduated scale of machine condition. The tolerances in the chart are for frequencies between 1.6 and 1667 hertz and apply to most rotating machinery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While absolute criteria are fine for acceptance testing, more sensitive criteria are needed for making accurate diagnoses as part of a predictive maintenance program. A relative criterion is best if your goal is to diagnose machine health accurately. Relative criteria are defined by averaging vibration measurements taken on several identical machines, all tested under similar operating conditions. For this case history, the acceptance criteria were constructed by averaging spectral measurements from 12 identical chillers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bronze disk mounting pads were mounted in the same location on each machine and the data were collected with the chiller operating at about 80 percent rated load. The test spectra were developed into average baseline spectral data after manual review of the data, so each test showed the machines to be in reasonably good condition. Due to variations of test data among machines in the sample, standard deviations (sigma) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, an average plus one sigma spectral mask was calculated. Statistically, about 85 percent of the vibration amplitudes should fall below the average plus one sigma mask. Unlike vendor defined pass/fail criteria or absolute criteria such as the IRD chart, the relative criteria allow the machines themselves to define what is acceptable. Figure 3 is an example of one axis of the relative acceptance criteria used in this case history. Figure 4 shows the average and average plus sigma level for all three axes for both the low- and high-range data. If one or more peaks in an 800-line spectrum exceeds the average plus sigma amplitude criterion, that fact alone does not indicate a significant problem (see the section on diagnostic strategies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Average baseline data from two separate facilities: Plant A (top 6 spectra) and Plant B (bottom 6 spectra). Each plant has 18 identical model chillers. The running speed of the Plant B data reflects a different average running speed (2,982 rpm), which reflects in input line frequency of 50 Hz common to Europe. This average and average plus sigma data is from the free end motor bearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Friction Bearing Problems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Bearing problems are some of the most common types of faults diagnosed by vibration analysis programs. In the early stages, a defective bearing will produce vibration components with frequencies that are not multiples of shaft rotation rate. The exact values of these non-synchronous frequencies are based on bearing geometry. They can be calculated if the race and roller dimensions are known. In practice, most facility engineers do not document the manufacturer and model number for bearings in machinery, and so must rely on other methods to determine bearing frequencies. A set of rules for determining approximate values of bearing tone frequencies follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race (BPFO)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Inner Race (BPFI)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Fundamental Train Frequency (FTF)&lt;br /&gt;
	= speed x 0.4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	The chiller manufacturer stated that the ball bearing in this case is an SKF 7318. The bearing table confirms that 4.9xM and 7.1xM are the outer and inner ball pass frequencies, respectively. These frequencies are presented as orders, where the suffix &amp;ldquo;xM&amp;rdquo; represents &amp;ldquo;times motor shaft rotation rate&amp;rdquo;. Looking at the frequencies and the rules of thumb, it is evident that this bearing has 12 rolling elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ball-bearing wear becomes increasingly evident as harmonics (integer multiples) of these ball-pass frequency peaks occur in the vibration spectra. Depending on the nature of the defect, there also may be strong 1xM sidebands around the bearing tones or their harmonics. Extreme bearing wear creates an abnormally high noise floor in the high-range spectra between about 70 and 100 times shaft rotation rate (70xM to 100xM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonly Used Diagnostic Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When evaluating bearing wear using vibration analysis, a consistent method of collecting and analyzing the data is necessary. Broadband vibration meters normally cannot detect bearing wear until the later stages. As a result, the maintenance technician has little warning to plan a repair, and risks catastrophic failure. Diagnostic techniques that rely on high-frequency phenomena such as shock pulse or ultrasonic energy are very effective at early detection of bearing wear. However, they typically lack the ability to detect the many machinery faults that manifest themselves with vibration at lower frequencies. Triaxial narrow band spectral analysis using relative acceptance criteria can accurately provide early warning of bearing defects. It also can be used to diagnose a wide range of other machinery problems such as imbalance, misalignment, impeller clearance problem, looseness and resonance. In this case, the third technique is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band data required for analysis includes two frequency ranges of high-resolution (800 lines) triaxial spectral data measured at a single point on a rigid part of the bearing housing. The low-range data is typically 0 to 10 orders of shaft speed where the fundamental bearing tones are easily seen. The high-range data is typically 0 to 100 orders of shaft speed, where the bearing tone harmonics and high-frequency noise floor are seen. While this may seem like an overkill of data for a single location, the mounting method and the bar code allow for simple and efficient data collection. Furthermore, processing the data on a PC is fast and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band fault model for a bearing defect, as taught in most basic vibration analysis courses, includes the following four conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonic series of peaks with a non-synchronous fundamental frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1xM and/or fundamental train frequency (FTF) sidebands around any of the peaks in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased high-frequency noise floor magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonics series of the shaft rotation rate caused by excessive bearing looseness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis (Human vs. Computer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The sheer quantity of narrow band data needed to accurately diagnose bearing defects requires that all the routine data reduction and logic functions are accomplished by a personal computer with an expert system. It is not time-economical for a human analyst to accomplish all the routine tasks that a computer can do in mere seconds. The first step is to order normalize the spectra with respect to the shaft rotating speed. The next step is to extract the amplitudes for the principal forcing frequencies and other peaks in the test data. The third step is to use the fault model described earlier to identify the pattern for a bearing defect. The last step is to determine the severity of the bearing defect, given that the pattern exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expert system logic used to identify the fault and its severity was created as part of an empirical process whereby the automated diagnosis on a large population of machines was compared to the diagnosis that a vibration expert would make on those same machines. The expert logic rules are, therefore, a reflection of exactly how a vibration expert would analyze the data. Because of this, an expert system can be no better than the vibration analyst who creates it. Because all the steps outlined in the previous paragraph are routine and repetitive, a modern computer can rapidly perform all four analysis steps in a few seconds per machine. The expert system then generates a text-based report for the chiller motor bearing wear as shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manual Review of the Spectral Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 6 shows the motor free end data collected on March 25 on Chiller 4. The Avg + sigma mask (red), are superimposed for comparison. The x-axis is scaled in units of orders where the order &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; represents the rotational rate of the motor. Note the prominent non-synchronous peaks in the axial low range data at 4.9xM and 7.1xM. These peaks correspond to the ball bearing pass frequencies for the motor bearing. In the high-range spectra, harmonic markers are placed on each peak of the harmonic series with 4.9xM spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note that the harmonic series has strong amplitudes in all three axes of the high range while only prominent in the axial direction in the low range data. The high-frequency noise floor is about the same or lower than the one sigma mask telling us that the bearing wear is not to a point of near failure; however, the strong harmonic series implies that a defect is present.&lt;/p&gt;

	There is little doubt whether a bearing fault exists. The machine operators can identify this condition by sound and touch. A more important question is: How much remaining life does this bearing have? The clever vibration analyst will not make a conclusion until a trend has developed and several data sets are available. For each diagnosis, the expert system calculates a severity score based on three things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of peaks that support the diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The amount by which the criterion is exceeded for each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The absolute amplitude of each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A trend of the severity score is a good indicator of machine health. For each diagnostic rule template, the severity score is mapped into a severity scale that includes slight, moderate, serious and extreme. The algorithm used for determining severity was derived empirically for each diagnosis based on a large amount of test results that had been manually analyzed by vibration experts. If the indications (bearing tones, harmonics, sidebands and noise floor) of bearing wear increase over time, the expert system will recognize this fact and the severity assigned to the bearing wear diagnosis will increase. In the trend plot (Figure 7), the motor bearing wear fault severity has leveled off at a low serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/52ae1de5-66e4-4bba-901b-cba639be15f1_bearing7.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The life expectancy of the bearing is mostly a function of the force on the bearing and the condition does not seem to be getting worse over the past year. Vibration analysis provides quantifiable evidence of the bearing condition and allows the owner to know the condition of his machinery. As the defect worsens, the bearing wear defect pattern will become more prominent. The expert system will respond by assigning a higher severity to the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chiller owner had called in a service engineer from the chiller manufacturer to measure vibration. Using an overall vibration meter, the technician told the owner that no problem existed with the bearing. The chiller manufacturer specifies an overall vibration maximum limit of 0.25 inch/second (peak). In this case, the overall level is probably less than the limit. This highlights one of the problems with using broadband measurements for predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broadband measurements completely missed the indications of bearing wear because broadband measurement is sensitive primarily to the highest peak seen in the spectrum. It does not see the BPFO harmonic series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To learn from this machine, and to obtain the maximum life from the bearing, the facility engineer must closely monitor this machine and compare its data to the average plus one standard deviation for this model of chiller. The expert system severity score is an excellent way to consistently trend the bearing health because it always applies the same logic and looks at a number of features in the data. When the severity increases toward the extreme level and a bearing replacement is ordered, the bearing should be saved and cut open for inspection. Possibly then, this case history would be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Case study: Diagnosing a low-speed gearbox problem</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A few months ago, I was called on to help in the diagnosis of a suspected gearbox problem in a large plant connected with the paper industry. The gearbox in question had an input shaft with a 23-tooth pinion driving a large bull gear with 132 teeth which, in turn, drives another bull gear of the same size. The two gears are connected to large steel rollers about 24 inches in diameter. The two output gears turn at 52 rpm and the pinion turns at 302 rpm (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/e4a73325-6525-4040-a4fd-b8fe362f7bc3_gearbox_figure1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricating oil in the gearbox was regularly subjected to analysis, and the last report stated that there were iron particles in the oil. The maintenance supervisor asked if we could determine the source of the oil contamination, and the first thing we did was to examine the vibration spectra measured near the bearings. The spectra looked normal, without evidence of bearing tones, so we suspected that the metal was coming from one or more of the gears (see Figure 2). The problem then became to identify the faulty gear (if any), so as to allow the maintenance effort to proceed without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/ce84e4c5-2dcd-4ecf-8910-01fb1380e7b6_gearbox_figure2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Synchronous averaging of time domain signals has been around for a long time, but in my opinion, has not been used nearly enough for machine problem diagnosis. In any case, we decided to perform synchronous averaging of the gearbox vibration signature. This involves the use of a tachometer-derived synchronizing trigger in the vibration analyzer to collect of series of waveform samples that are averaged together. The important part of this is that the beginning of each time record must occur at exactly the same time in the rotation of the gear in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This allows the entire vibration signal that comes from the gear to be emphasized in the time domain average, and all the vibration components from the other gears, shaft rpm, and bearing tones, etc., to be averaged out. This produces a time waveform that shows the individual teeth on the gear, with very little contamination from other components from the machine. When doing synchronous averaging, the analysis parameters of the analyzer are adjusted so the time record length spans a little more time than one revolution on the gear. This is easily accomplished since the time record length (T) is the reciprocal of the FFT line spacing (DF) in the spectrum. It is simply a matter of choosing a frequency span and number of lines so 1/DF is longer than 1 divided by the gear speed in hertz (Hz). Of course, it is possible to look at the spectrum taken from a synchronized waveform, but we did not bother to do this since the waveform provided the needed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using synchronous averaging, the number of averages used must be quite large; usually in the vicinity of 100 or so. For the tests described here, we used 90 averages. (See Figure 3 for the setup details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/d5aa4517-d84e-445d-b62f-3f11e2987d23_gearbox_figure3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases of synchronous averaging, the time record is much more interesting that the spectrum, since the spectrum contains no time information, and the time domain shows any irregularities in the gear meshing. In this case, all the spectra were unremarkable, simply showing the gear mesh frequency and some harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we did synchronous averaging on each of the two bull gears, there was no indication of any defect in the waveform. But, when we performed the same test on the pinion, the waveform told another story. There was an obvious area on the gear where the meshing with the bull gear was very noisy and non-uniform (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/93fb2c27-5b70-4830-bb6c-04de63d335bc_gearbox_figure4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On looking at this data, we called for an inspection of the gear, but the maintenance chief was skeptical, saying that gearboxes with more vibration that this one had run for 20 years without any problems. But we insisted, and finally an access plate was removed so we could look at the gears. We found that the keyway in the pinion shaft was badly worn such that the gear could be rotated back and forth on the shaft by about one-half of a tooth at the edge of the gear. There was also visible clearance between the shaft and the bore of the pinion. The bull gears showed no sign of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We called one of the engineers at the gearbox factory and described the situation. He said the problem occurred during installation when the interference fit between the pinion and the shaft was too loose. He said the shaft and pinion would have to be replaced, and very soon, to avoid a catastrophic failure. This made believers out of the maintenance people who originally thought the gearbox need not be overhauled. From that time on, the vibration monitoring program at this plant has enjoyed a much increased popularity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned earlier, synchronous averaging is not a new technique, but it seems to be seldom used in industry. It is not a difficult thing to do, and can result in information about a machine that is almost impossible to obtain any other way. Furthermore, there are many analyzers on the market that do it, from small battery-powered units to larger mains-powered systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following photos of the pinion illustrate the damage:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Fluke creates online glossary of vibration terms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Fluke Corporation has made available at its Web site a glossary of the key vibration terms that those involved in equipment maintenance and vibration diagnosis may encounter when evaluating machine vibration.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the world of mechanical maintenance, vibration remains one of the earliest indicators of a machine&amp;#39;s health and the effects of vibration can be severe. Unchecked machine vibration can accelerate rates of wear (i.e. reduce bearing life), damage equipment, create noise, cause safety problems and lead to degradation in plant working conditions. Vibration can cause machinery to consume excessive power and may damage product quality. In the worst cases, vibration can damage equipment so severely as to knock it out of service and halt plant production. Consequently, knowing the basic terminology of machine vibration and analysis is essential for anyone who is part of a preventive maintenance program or plant maintenance team.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Plant ensures reliability with predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	LCRA&amp;#39;s utility operations are full of electronic and moving parts. Making sure all those parts stay in working order is the job of predictive maintenance crews. Heat-sensing cameras and vibration detectors are just of couple of the modern tools the crews use to ensure the power and water stay on. Watch as a crew gives an irrigation pumping plant an end-of-season check-up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pump vibration testing in the shop </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A basic principle of machinery vibration analysis is evaluating whether specific vibration amplitudes are excessive. The use of vibration equipment in preventive maintenance involves keeping a vibration history on individual pieces of equipment in a plant, keeping a record of all PM heat and when the unit was greased and what type of grease was used.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing analysis kit provides oil and vibration condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit now is available, providing all the necessary equipment and consumables for oil and overall machine vibration condition monitoring. The kit is designed to provide fast, accurate results for multiple oil parameters, on-site maintenance decisions and assessment of overall machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supplied ready to use in a heavy-duty aluminum case, the SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit&amp;rsquo;s main feature is the SKF Machine Condition Advisor (MCA). The MCA simultaneously measures machine vibration signals and temperature to indicate machine health and bearing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complementing the MCA is a test cell, a lubrication assessment tool engineered to provide accurate results for Water-in-Oil (lubricants) and Total Base Number (TBN) tests. The water-in-oil test helps maintain equipment by indicating if water appears in lubricants, which enables intervention that protects the equipment from damage. &amp;nbsp;The Total Base Number provides an indication of the oil&amp;rsquo;s alkaline reserve and ability to neutralize acids from combustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit provides maintenance engineers with a condition monitoring solution that helps with on-site maintenance decisions to more effectively maintain plant equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Torsten Bark, product project manager, SKF. &amp;ldquo;Water contamination can cause various problems in lubricating oils, and the tools in the kit indentify those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the kit contains a Viscostick and Insolubles. The Viscostick provides a simple &amp;ldquo;go/no go&amp;rdquo; result when the distillate fuel dilutions of an SAE 30 to 40 engine oil is tested. The Insolubles detects high insolubles from diesel engine combustion products such as fuel ash, carbon, partially oxidized fuel, oil oxidation products and spent lubrication additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For more information about the SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit, contact your local SKF representative or visit &lt;a href="http://globalmessaging2.prnewswire.com/clickthrough/servlet/clickthrough?msg_id=6711588&amp;amp;adr_order=60&amp;amp;url=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5za2YuY29t"&gt;www.skf.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/pCInHI_yAsQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Phase analysis: Making vibration analysis easier</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is mostly a learned skill. It is based 70 percent on experience and 30 percent on classroom training and self study. It takes years to become a confident and competent vibration analyst. When the analysis is wrong, the recommendations for repair also will be incorrect. No vibration analyst wants to make the wrong call. In this business, credibility is gained in small steps and lost in large chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A vibration sensor placed on a bearing housing and connected to a vibration analyzer provides time, frequency and amplitude information in the form of a waveform and a spectrum (Figure 1). This data is the foundation for vibration analysis. It contains the signatures of nearly all mechanical and electrical defects present on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style2" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 1. Vibration Waveform and Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vibration analysis process involves determining the vibration severity, identifying frequencies and patterns, associating the peaks and patterns with mechanical or electrical components, forming conclusions and, if necessary, making recommendations for repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everybody involved in vibration analysis knows that analyzing vibration is not easy nor automated. Have you ever wondered why? Here are a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Machines Have Multiple Faults:&lt;/strong&gt; The vibration patterns we learn in training and read about in books just don&amp;rsquo;t look the same in the real world. We learn how mechanical and electrical faults look in the purest form &amp;ndash; as if there was always only that one problem on the machine causing vibration. Machines usually have more than one vibration-producing fault. At a minimum, all machines have some unbalance and misalignment. When other faults develop, the waveform and spectrum quickly become complicated and difficult to analyze. The data no longer matches the fault patterns we have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Cause and Effect Vibration:&lt;/strong&gt; For every action, there is a reaction. Some of the vibration we measure is the effect of other problems. For example, the force caused by rotor unbalance can make the machine look like it is out of alignment, loose or rubbing. Consider all of the things that shake and rattle on your car when one tire goes out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Many Fault Types Have Similar Patterns: &lt;/strong&gt;Because machine rotors rotate at a particular speed, and vibration is a cyclical force, many mechanical and electrical faults exhibit similar frequency patterns that make it difficult to distinguish one fault from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning to analyze vibration just takes time. Training courses, technical publications and other resources such as online resources and commercial self teaching material are available that can improve analysis skills and shorten the learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is one diagnostic technique which quickly gets to the source of most vibration problems. It is possibly the most powerful of all vibration diagnostic techniques. It has been around as long as vibration analysis itself yet hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten a lot of attention, and it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find good information about the subject. What is this technique? It&amp;rsquo;s called phase analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Phase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is the position of a rotating part at any instant with respect to a fixed point. Phase gives us the vibration direction. Tuning a car engine using a timing light and inductive sensor is an application of phase analysis (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 2. Engine tuning using a timing light is phase analysis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A phase study is a collection of phase measurements made on a machine or structure and evaluated to reveal information about relative motion between components. In vibration analysis, phase is measured using absolute or relative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Absolute phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured with one sensor and one tachometer referencing a mark on the rotating shaft (Figure 3). At each measurement point, the analyzer calculates the time between the tachometer trigger and the next positive waveform peak vibration. This time interval is converted to degrees and displayed as the absolute phase (Figure 4). Phase can be measured at shaft rotational frequency or any whole number multiple of shaft speed (synchronous frequencies). Absolute phase is required for rotor balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 3. Absolute Phase Measurement &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 4. Absolute phase is calculated between the tach signal and vibration waveform.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Relative phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured on a multi-channel vibration analyzer using two or more (similar type) vibration sensors. The analyzer must be able to measure cross-channel phase. One single-axis sensor serves as the fixed reference and is placed somewhere on the machine (typically on a bearing housing). Another single-axis or triaxial sensor is moved sequentially to all of the other test points (Figure 5). At each test point, the analyzer compares waveforms between the fixed and roving sensors. Relative phase is the time difference between the waveforms at a specific frequency converted to degrees (Figure 6). Relative phase does not require a tachometer so phase can be measured at any frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 5. Relative Phase Measurement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Relative Phase Calculated Between Two Vibration Waveforms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both types of phase measurements are easy to make. Relative phase is the most convenient way to measure phase on a machine because the machine does not need to be stopped to install reflective tape on the shaft. Phase can be measured at any frequency. Most single-channel vibration analyzers can measure absolute phase. Multi-channel vibration analyzers like the Pruftechnik VibXpert illustrated in Figure 7 have standard functions for measuring both absolute and relative phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 7. Pruftechnik VibXpert 2-Channel Vibration Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;When to use Phase Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Everyone needs phase analysis. A phase study should be made on problem machines when the source of the vibration is not clear or when it is necessary to confirm suspected sources of vibration. A phase study might include points measured only on the machine bearings or it can include points over the entire machine from the foundation up to the bearings. The following are examples of how phase can help analyze vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Soft Foot &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The term soft foot is used to describe machine frame distortion. It can be caused by a condition where the foot of a motor, pump or other component is not flat, square and tight to its mounting, or many other things, such as machining errors, bent or twisted feet and non-flat mounting surfaces. Soft foot increases vibration and puts undue stress on bearings, seals and couplings. Soft foot on a motor distorts the stator housing creating a non-uniform rotor to stator air gap resulting in vibration at two times line frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good laser shaft alignment system should be used to verify soft foot by loosening the machine feet one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase can be used to identify soft foot while the machine is in operation. Measure vertical phase between the foot and its mounting surface. If the joint is tight, the phase angle is the same between surfaces. If the phase angle is different by more than 20 degrees, the foot is loose or the machine frame is cracked or flimsy. Figure 8 is an example of the phase shift across a soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 8. A phase shift between the foot and mount may indicate soft foot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cocked Bearings and Bent Shafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect cocked bearings and bent shafts. Measure phase at four axial locations around the bearing housing. If the bearing is cocked or the shaft is bent through the bearing, the phase will be different at each location. If the shaft is straight and the bearing is not twisting, the phase will be the same at each location (Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 9. Phase identifies in-plane or twisting bearing motion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Confirm Imbalance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A once-per-revolution radial vibration usually means rotor unbalance. Use phase to prove imbalance is the problem. To confirm imbalance, measure the horizontal and vertical phase on a shaft or bearing housing. If the difference between the phase values is approximately 90 degrees, the problem is rotor unbalance (Figure 10). If the phase difference is closer to zero or 180 degrees, the vibration is caused by a reaction force. An eccentric pulley and shaft misalignment are examples of reaction forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 10. Horizontal to Vertical Phase Shift of about 90 Degrees Confirms Unbalance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Looseness, Bending or Twisting &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect loose joints on structures and bending or twisting due to weakness or resonance. To check for looseness, measure the vertical phase at each mechanical joint as indicated by the arrows in Figure 11. When joints are loose, there will be a phase shift of approximately 180 degrees. The phase angle will not change across a tight joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 11. A phase shift between bolted joints indicates looseness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shaft Misalignment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Shaft misalignment is easily verified with phase. Measure each bearing in the horizontal, vertical and axial directions. Record the values in a table or bubble diagram as shown in Figure 12. Compare the horizontal phase from bearing to bearing on each component and across the coupling. Repeat the comparison using vertical then axial data. Good alignment will show no substantial phase shift between bearings or across the coupling. The machine in Figure 12 has a 180-degree phase shift across the coupling in the radial directions. The axial directions are in-phase across the machine. The data indicates parallel (offset) shaft misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 12. Phase Data Indicates Parallel Shaft Misalignment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operational Deflection Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Instead of comparing the phase and magnitude numbers from a table or bubble diagram, operational deflection shape software (ODS) can be used to animate a machine drawing. An ODS is a measurement technique used to analyze the motion of rotating equipment and structures during normal operation. An ODS is an extension of phase analysis where a computer-generated model of the machine is animated with phase and magnitude data or simultaneously measured time waveforms. The animation is visually analyzed to diagnose problems. ODS testing is able to identify a wide variety of mechanical faults and resonance issues such as looseness, soft foot, broken welds, misalignment, unbalance, bending or twisting from resonance, structural weakness and foundation problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 13 is a simple ODS of three direct-coupled shafts. Phase and magnitude were measured from permanently mounted X and Y displacement probes on a turbine generator. The values listed in the table were used in ODS software to animate a stick figure drawing of the high- and low-pressure turbine shafts and the generator shaft. The picture to the right of the table is a capture from the ODS animation showing the vibration pattern of each shaft and the relative motion between shafts at 3,600 cycles per minute (turning speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 13. Shaft Operational Deflection Shape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many machines vibrate due to deteriorated foundations, looseness, resonance of the support structure and other problems that occur below the machine bearings. A phase study might include hundreds of test points measured all over the machine and foundation. Good ODS software can make it easier to analyze phase and magnitude data from a large number of test points. Analysis of an ODS involves observation and interpretation of the machine in motion. Figure 14 is an ODS structure drawing of a vertical pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition-based vibration testing is a vital component of a reliability based maintenance program. Vibration sensors, instruments and software are able to provide key information about machine health. The weak link in the chain is the analyst&amp;rsquo;s ability to interpret the data, accurately diagnose the problem and trend the fault until it is time to recommend corrective action. Phase analysis is a very powerful diagnostic tool. Every vibration analyst should be using phase to improve vibration analysis accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Arch Coal recognized for excellence in predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal Inc. on September 22 announced that its predictive maintenance program has been named as the best overall program among mobile equipment fleets from around the world by an industrial trade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Earning the best predictive maintenance award is an important achievement for Arch Coal&amp;#39;s national network of mines,&amp;quot; said John W. Eaves, Arch&amp;#39;s president and chief operating officer. &amp;quot;The mining environment is very dynamic, which makes the maintenance of equipment an intense and challenging effort. That&amp;#39;s why our mining personnel value the recognition for their best-in-class practices that include managing risk and reducing exposure through planned, preventative and predictive maintenance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal&amp;#39;s predictive maintenance program employs certified maintenance engineers at each mining complex and standardized processes to provide comprehensive oil and vibration analysis, ultrasonic flaw detection, thermography and motor circuit analysis. This technology is used for quality standards and acceptance testing at component and rebuild facilities certified by Arch. According to Arch&amp;#39;s director of technical and maintenance services, Bob McCreary, Arch has reduced controllable maintenance costs by 5 percent annually over the last four years by integrating a comprehensive predictive maintenance program throughout its national network of mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	St. Louis-based Arch Coal, Inc. is the nation&amp;#39;s second-largest coal producer. The company&amp;#39;s core business is providing U.S. power generators with clean-burning, low-sulfur coal for electric generation. The company also ships coal to domestic and international steel manufacturers as well as international power producers. Through its national network of mines and 4,600-person workforce, Arch supplies the fuel for approximately 8 percent of the electricity generated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/Yd59B-fDGTE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Vibration analysis is like winning the lottery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ah, to be able to predict the winning numbers in a lottery &amp;ndash; who hasn&amp;rsquo;t had that dream! Life would be so easy and carefree with a crystal ball. And, would not your maintenance job be so much simpler if you could just identify machine damage in time and predict the point at which repairs really become necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to DIN 31051, condition-oriented maintenance is not limited to inspection, servicing, determination of the machine condition and maintenance scheduling. It also encompasses predicting the length of service life remaining for machines and systems. This means it is not always necessary to replace a rolling bearing when an inspection measurement reveals inner raceway frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article describes how it was possible to keep a damaged bearing running for several months until the scheduled annual outage came around &amp;ndash; naturally under close observation. Periodic measurements had shown that there had only been a slight change in the envelope spectrum. But one thing at a time &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, a contractor was awarded a contract for the mobile condition measurement of a double-shaft extruder gear. So, before the diagnostic specialist carries out measurements on location, the gear construction data is established by way of the factory number and the bearing frequencies are calculated for the entire drive (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca111.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this purpose, the contractor used a computer program that recognizes almost all gear types, including variable speed drives. Having calculated the excitation frequencies, the diagnostic specialist visits the customer to determine the current condition of the drive &amp;ndash; which in this case was already 7 years old &amp;ndash; and to find any deviations. Beginning bearing damage was identified during control measurement as a result of the distinct, albeit not yet critical, vibrations of an inner raceway frequency that were picked up in the input shaft area. The gear condition was recorded and the recommendation to procure replacement parts for the intermediate shaft was made to the operator. Repeated monthly measurements were recommended to assess whether the bearing needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows two envelope spectra that were recorded three months apart at the same measuring point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca112.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Measured Values Recorded at a Three-month Interval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because changes were only slight, an immediate replacement of the bearing was not deemed necessary, and the decision was made to continue operation until the scheduled annual outage. The bearing was exchanged five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca113.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Dismantling the Intermediate Shaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon dismantling the bearing, the damage diagnosed on the inner raceway could be confirmed as expected &amp;ndash; nine months after initial diagnosis. Pittings are clearly visible on the inner raceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca114.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Inner Raceway with Diagnosed Pitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The extruder was back in operation two days later as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In hindsight, both the diagnosis and the predicted remaining service time proved to be correct and economically wise. Expensive &amp;ldquo;crash repair&amp;rdquo; was unnecessary in this case. And, avoiding downtime was almost like picking a &amp;ldquo;winning number&amp;rdquo; in the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Datastick announces machine vibration seminar in California July 20-23</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A four-day Machine Vibration seminar with hands-on practical experience will be held on July 20 through 23 in San Jose, Calif. Attendees can become certified as Level I vibration analysts by taking a test on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analyzing the vibration of rotating and reciprocating machinery provides an early warning system that alerts maintenance and reliability managers to machine health problems to help avoid costly, sudden breakdowns. Datastick&amp;rsquo;s handheld VSA Vibration Spectrum Analyzer will be used in the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four-day seminar includes hands-on practice as well as training on the basics of vibration, such as: what is an FFT; waveform vs. spectrum; an introduction to spectrum analysis; when and how to use the displacement, velocity and acceleration domains; and how to set up and manage inspection routes. Also covered are: effective sensor placement, onsite troubleshooting, detection of unbalance, eccentric rotors, gear wear and bearing failure, as well as how to measure vibration, create reports, and analyze the results to determine the likely cause of machine function problems such as resonance, rotor bar issues, and more. A full agenda can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.datastick.com/training"&gt;www.datastick.com/training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, predictive maintenance and Reliability-Centered Maintenance programs are replacing run-to-failure methods &amp;ndash; as well as preventive maintenance methods that were based on taking a piece of equipment offline for costly service, regardless of condition, after a certain number of hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hands-on practical experience is important to effective training, and this seminar provides it,&amp;rdquo; said Penny Melrose, CEO of Datastick Systems. &amp;ldquo;The Datastick VSA is an excellent tool for someone new to vibration because of its extremely fast learning curve and exceptional ease of use, along with full analysis comparable to or better than some analyzers at more than double the cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The course and exam meet the ISO 18436-2 and the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) SNT-TC-1A standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Datastick Systems Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audible, visual and tactile inspections for PdM personnel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is the backbone of any vibration monitoring effort, yet opportunities to gather additional data while at the machine are typically ignored. Is the vibration industry finally beginning to feel the effects of the pure data collector who has not transitioned into the reliability group from the mechanical trades? What about the site operators and craftsman? This paper covers basic inspection techniques that can be applied to optimize time spent in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations separate personnel who perform technology monitoring into a predictive maintenance (PdM) team or reliability group. Their job is to periodically collect machinery information using various forms of technology and use this data to assess the condition of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Different technologies exist for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical components, and especially for detecting impending failure. Each technology has it own applications, advantages and disadvantages. Effective condition monitoring makes use of multiple techniques and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An under-utilized group of checks that provide valuable data are basic visual, audible and tactile inspections. These inspections can be performed and used to supplement the formal technology inspections. The key to successful implementation of a visual, audible and tactile inspection program is training the participants on the basic operation of the component to be inspected and following a list of items to be checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition monitoring steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective condition monitoring programs consist of four major elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to thoroughly understand each of these elements. Valuable time is too often wasted when too much emphasis is placed on any one component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many problems can be found using visual, audible and tactile inspections. The goal is to identify bad machines or identify deteriorating conditions. The question becomes how to quantify the results of these inspections. Technologies like vibration, thermography, ultrasound, oil analysis and motor circuit testing may be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After identifying machines in need of further analysis using detection, the next step is to determine the root cause of the problem. This is achieved during the analysis phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1. Problem Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The purpose of performing an analysis is to determine the root cause of the problem. The analysis phase involves studying the machine&amp;rsquo;s operation, defect characteristics, maintenance history, etc. Only the machines indicating problems should be analyzed. Once the analysis is complete and the root cause of the problem found, the results should be communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2. Problem Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction/Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, it can be corrected. The most common problems require balancing and/or precision alignment. In order to maximize the reliability of the machine in question, it is also advisable to improve the source causing the asset to be in exception. This will extend the life of the machine. We at Universal Technologies emphasize that the incremental time required to improve the machine is small compared to the costs of the unanticipated machine downtime and the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3. Problem Correction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, correcting the problem and improving the machine, it is important to verify that the correction or improvement has occurred. One mechanism for this verification is comparing before values to the original baseline data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other common verification methods include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased bearing life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased seal life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring reduced energy consumption&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring vibration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor current signature analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4. Correction Verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the simplest, but often neglected, forms of condition monitoring is visual inspection of machinery. While this is subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;gut feel&amp;rdquo; for where the problem is most severe. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective visual inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General cleanliness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on surrounding machine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on machine casing or bearing caps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on coupling guard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unusual marks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visible leaks (lubricants, cooling water, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lighting conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Local instrumentation for proper levels, temperatures, flows and amperage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fretting and wear particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Signs of overheating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper operation of slinger rings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Condensation/water in bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Differential temperatures, pressures and flows&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loose parts or components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machine guard or cover condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audible inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another simple form of condition monitoring is audible inspection of machinery. While this is also subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for the area where the source is originating. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner. The use of stethoscopes, sounding rods and other listening devices can enable an experienced practitioner to detect such problems as rubs, bearing defects, cavitation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When listening to a machine, try to determine if the sound is complex or simple, high frequency or low frequency, and from where the sound appears to be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective audible inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sounds that are out of the ordinary&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Humming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Squealing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Growling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rubbing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cavitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Arcing/popping sounds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hunting/beats&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Noise from leaks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Comparison noise from bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water hammer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lifting sentinels/relief valves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flow through system / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactile inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To hand-feel a machine for excessive vibration, perform the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Start at the bearings, feeling in vertical, horizontal and axial directions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work downward and outward from the machine, feeling the base, structures, pipes, pipe supports, valve stems, electrical boxes, electrical conduit, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Try to get a sense of the frequency of the vibration. For instance, is it high frequency, such as a buzz or a tingle? Or, is it low frequency, such as a shudder or a sway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10. Motor Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other tactile observations should be performed as well. Effective tactile inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on seal flush systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on cooler / heat exchanger inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on filters / strainers inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel oil for contaminants and metal particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel for flow through systems / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhancing visual inspections with spot radiometers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Infrared thermometers measure the amount of infrared energy emitted by a target object and calculate the temperature of that object&amp;rsquo;s surface. Typical features include laser sighting, adjustable emissivity, alarm functions and trigger locks. Other features may include data loggers and graphic displays, thermocouples, and software interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that the temperature reading is the outer surface temperature of the first surface the laser beam penetrates. If taking a reading through Plexiglas or other transparent material that the laser penetrates, the temperature reading will represent the Plexiglas surface only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11. Spot Radiometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; emissivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Emissivity is ability of a material to reflect heat. Different materials have different emissivity values and must be accounted for when attempting to obtain an absolute temperature reading. For comparison readings, emissivity is less of an issue provided that the two target materials are the same. If there is a need for accurate absolute temperature measurement, then the contact thermocouple provided should be used to cross-check the infrared data. Your instrument has functions that allow you to select the correct emissivity value for the target material, but for the intent of this article and general instrument use, the &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; setting will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; measurement spot size: &lt;/strong&gt;The measured spot size depends on the distance between the object you are measuring and the infrared thermometer. This will vary depending on manufacturer and by models from the same manufacturer. Note that the temperature is an average of the temperatures contained within the spot circle. Move closer to the target to get a smaller measurement area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strobe lights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Visual inspection of rotating assets in conjunction with using a strobe light allows other components to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coupling, shaft and key condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leak detection from bearing caps, mechanical seals and couplings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mechanical looseness of machine components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Belt condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Even tensioning / loading of belt drive systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12. Strobe Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Precautions and safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Objects viewed with this product may appear to be stationary when in fact they are moving at high speeds. Always keep a safe distance from and do not touch the target. Be aware of others in the area and take responsibility for their safety by warning them of these precautions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use of this equipment may induce an epileptic seizure with those prone to this type of attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do not allow liquids or metallic objects to enter the ventilation ports on the stroboscope to avoid damage to the instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Caution &amp;ndash; there are lethal voltages present inside the instrument. Refer to manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s literature for lamp replacement procedure before attempting to open the instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To assist in the inspection of couplings and belts with a strobe, it is recommended to use expanded metal with a flat black finish for coupling and belt guards whenever possible. This permits the user to see through the guard with a minimum of reflection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Performing visual, audible and tactile inspections can provide tremendous value when integrated into an overall reliability effort. Formalizing and documenting inspections that are being performed by non-PdM technicians will allow data to be utilized by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acceptance of integrating technologies to gain a better picture of equipment condition is widely accepted. Why not use this same model to leverage information from personnel who traditionally are not viewed as having an active role in reliability? Many times, operators and maintenance personnel can provide that &amp;ldquo;missing piece&amp;rdquo; of information that cannot be seen by the PdM technician when viewing equipment on a monthly or quarterly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many organizations would jump at the chance to add dozens of additional personnel to the reliability effort without adding additional cost? By training and engaging operators and maintenance personnel, that is exactly what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Azima DLI ensures reliability of Panama Canal locks using vibration monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on June 21 announced that its advanced vibration monitoring capabilities will be used by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) to achieve important equipment reliability and uptime goals associated with the operation of its lock system. The ACP is the autonomous agency of the Government of Panama in charge of managing, operating and maintaining the Panama Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Panama Canal is in constant operation, so uptime of critical equipment, such as the motors and hydraulic pumps used to ensure the locks operate as they are supposed to, is vitally important to the commercial and private vessels that rely on the Canal every day. Of the three locks, Miraflores was the first to select, through a public bid (provided through Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Central American distributor Termogram), the Azima DLI DCX, a rugged, four channel vibration data collector and real-time analyzer. Miraflores Locks&amp;rsquo; maintenance unit will use the Azima DLI vibration data collectors after training is complete. Termogram can provide the onsite training and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Panama Canal locks have long been recognized as significant engineering accomplishments. All lock chambers have the same 110 by 1,000 feet dimensions, and they are built in pairs. That means two lanes of chambers run side-by-side to accommodate two lanes of traffic, either in opposite directions at the same time or in the same direction, depending on transit needs. To make sure the locks are performing as needed, the ACP&amp;rsquo;s Miraflores Locks&amp;rsquo; maintenance unit will collect all its own data using the DCX to take vibration measurements on Miraflores&amp;rsquo; 200 motor pump groups (MPGs), which include gates, valves, locomotives and other motors throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our maintenance program includes thermography, remote visual inspection, oil analysis and vibration, which is an important component of measurement,&amp;rdquo; said Miraflores Locks maintenance manager Carlos Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Windows-compatible Azima DLI DCX allows vibration analysts to record, collect and analyze vibration information directly from a military-grade Tablet PC that features embedded ExpertALERT vibration analysis software. Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s ExpertAlert software allows analysts to have all their machinery history, analysis tools and automated diagnostic results at the point of data collection, supporting timely maintenance and repair decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the case of the Panama Canal, although MPGs are redundant in the lock machinery, failure avoidance is of utmost importance. If the MPG redundancy fails, the lock doors don&amp;rsquo;t open, causing delays with Canal traffic,&amp;rdquo; said Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Director of International Sales Ron Sullivan. &amp;ldquo;Due to the critical nature of its operations, the Panama Canal Authority is a leader in developing effective machine condition monitoring programs, maximizing the use of critical software to ensure its equipment is in peak condition. We are proud that Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX data collector and ExpertAlert diagnostic software will become important components of the maintenance team&amp;rsquo;s overall program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Azima DLI &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Azima DLI is the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services that align with customers&amp;rsquo; high standards for reliability, availability and uptime. Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s WATCHMAN Reliability Services utilize flexible deployment models, proven diagnostic software and unmatched analytical expertise to deliver sustainable, scalable and cost-effective condition-based maintenance programs.

            <title>NV Energy installs wireless solution to increase plant reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	No matter where an asset sits in the plant, the need to understand its health has become increasingly vital. While most facilities continuously monitor their critical machinery, their less-critical assets &amp;ndash; often called &amp;ldquo;essential assets&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; cannot typically justify the expense of a traditional continuous monitoring system due to the installation costs of running wires and installing sensors. As such, these assets tend to be addressed with portable data collection programs where operators make rounds at monthly or quarterly intervals, manually collecting data. However, these data collection intervals are rarely satisfactory for essential assets, and problems can progress from &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; from one data collection interval to the next. Or, in some cases, manual data collection is simply not practical or possible due to the nature of the asset &amp;ndash; jeopardizing the safety of the employee tasked with collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To address such challenges and elevate plant reliability, industrial facilities are increasingly turning to wireless. NV Energy highlights this trend with its recent installation of GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Bently Nevada Essential Insight.mesh wireless condition monitoring system. The system was installed at the company&amp;rsquo;s Fort Churchill Operating Station in Yerington, Nev., with the goal of reducing operating expenses and increasing reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before the installation of Essential Insight.mesh, these assets were only infrequently monitored by a walk-around program. The wireless condition monitoring systems help to improve overall plant reliability and efficiency by extending condition monitoring to a broader array of essential assets that were previously underserved and classified as mid- to low-criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We were excited to be the first plant in NV Energy to utilize this new technology,&amp;rdquo; says Greg Bushman, plant manager at Fort Churchill. &amp;ldquo;We have always used Bently Nevada condition monitoring for our critical assets, so it seemed like a natural fit to extend this to our essential assets, as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the course of two days, the entire wireless system was deployed and configured on a wide range of rotating machines, including boiler feed pumps, condensate pumps, AC lube oil pumps, service water pumps, circulation water pumps and an FD fan. The system consisted of 21 vibration sensors, seven wSIM nodes, three Repeaters and System 1 software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system began returning useful information almost immediately as anomalies were detected on cooling water pumps and confirmed the need to plan and schedule repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because the data from these assets is transmitted wirelessly to the plant&amp;rsquo;s Electronics Room, where a System 1 display computer is located, it is now within easy reach of plant operators and is integrated with all of the data from other monitored assets, such as the plant&amp;rsquo;s critical turbine-generator sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This provides operators with plant-wide analysis and insight capabilities on the mechanical condition of their assets, allowing data-driven decisions and thus reducing costs of plant operations and maintenance. Armed with these benefits, and the considerably lower costs of installation and deployment that wireless technology affords, customers can more confidently and easily justify expansion of online condition monitoring to a broader spectrum of assets in their plants, such as remote deep-well pumps, cooling towers and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By helping plants extend affordable, online monitoring to more asset types, they can operate smarter &amp;ndash; increasing efficiency, reliability, and uptime, which can translate to a reduction in operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Vibration tester keeps the good stuff flowing at Alpenrose Dairy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At Alpenrose Dairy in Portland, Ore., operators process the raw milk into a dozen varieties of milk, six cultured products (cottage cheese and sour cream) and 31 flavors of ice cream. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to keep the complex Alpenrose production facility, with its hundreds of motors, pumps and gearboxes, running butter-smooth. But thanks to the new Fluke 810 Vibration Tester, it&amp;rsquo;s easier today to maintain Alpenrose as the cream of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn&amp;rsquo;t your average dairy. Family owned and operated since 1916, Alpenrose Dairy Inc. has evolved over time into a community entertainment center that includes Alpenrose Stadium, Dairyville, a replica of a western frontier town, a 600-seat opera house, a Quarter Midget racing arena and an Olympic-style bicycle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hub of this high-profile enterprise is the production plant, churning out dairy products that get to market the day they left the farm. Maintenance manager Eric Trummel and maintenance technician and electric motor expert Todd Toburen keep their fingers on the pulse of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke21.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the U.S. Navy, Toburen learned vibration analysis to find and diagnose electric motor problems. &amp;ldquo;We would take our readings and send the data to Annapolis. Annapolis would compile tons of data bouncing off of different frequencies and give us a call back to tell us whether it was good or bad,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;We would rewind and rebuild the motor and retest it, just to make sure what we sent out to the fleet was a good piece of equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pumps, motors, gearboxes and more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In his five years at Alpenrose, Toburen has taken charge of the hundreds of pumps, motors, gearboxes, compressors and other equipment required to operate a midsize dairy plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got equipment here that if it goes down, processing stops,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If the bad part is a high-dollar item, we don&amp;rsquo;t have sitting on the shelf. We could be down for a couple of days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the dairy business, where fresh products are essential, such an outage is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prevent such incidents, Alpenrose manages a more proactive maintenance program to help understand when a motor or machine may encounter problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our biggest concerns are the pieces of equipment that are critical to the processes,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If we see that there&amp;rsquo;s deterioration in the bearings or what have you, we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to schedule the downtime to take care of that problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But accuracy is key. Trummel recalls an incident when a vibration analysis contractor doing a semiannual check warned of bearing deterioration in an important air compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;He claimed that one of the bearings had gone bad, and that we needed to take care of it in the next couple of months,&amp;rdquo; Trummel said. &amp;ldquo;The next week, the coupling on the compressor disintegrated. The air compressor went down, and it represented a limitation of the plant. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized these guys may not know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. This is why this Fluke 810 is relevant to us. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have this capability in-house and check this equipment every couple of weeks. We get a better idea and a better feel for what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The handheld Fluke 810 is designed for maintenance professionals who need to troubleshoot mechanical problems and quickly understand the root cause of equipment condition. It&amp;rsquo;s programmed to diagnose the most common mechanical problems of unbalance, looseness, misalignment and bearing failures in a wide variety of mechanical equipment, including motors, fans, gearboxes, couplings, pumps, compressors and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The diagnostic technology in the Fluke 810 analyzes machinery condition and identifies faults by comparing vibration data to an extensive set of rules and algorithms developed over years of field experience. The Fluke 810 is not merely a vibration detector, but a complete diagnostic and problem-solving solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the Fluke, we&amp;rsquo;re able to take a reading once a week or once a month&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;If we notice something different, we can build a trend analysis with that data. If we notice there&amp;rsquo;s a change in our frequencies, that&amp;rsquo;s something we need to look at. Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able every single month to do every piece of equipment here at the dairy. We&amp;rsquo;ll prioritize what equipment we want to check on a monthly or a quarterly basis, and I&amp;rsquo;m basing that on what my baseline reading is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;The diagnosis was right on&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Machine operators form an important early warning system. If a machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel or sound right to them, Toburen troubleshoots the equipment with the Fluke 810 to see exactly what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The nice thing with this is you&amp;rsquo;re able to tell, &amp;lsquo;Is it the gearbox? Is it the compressor? Is it the motor? Is it the drive end? Is it the off end?&amp;rsquo; It even breaks it down to if you have a loose coupling or not,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fluke 810 also rates the level of severity of any problems it finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It has four different levels,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;Green being slight, yellow being moderate, orange being serious and red being extreme.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Toburen said it took some checking to fully trust the opinions of the Fluke 810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I had to develop a comfort level with the Fluke&amp;rsquo;s interpretation,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a bit of that. Somebody would come up and say they had a real loud motor. I&amp;rsquo;d go out and take a vibration analysis on it, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done that it&amp;rsquo;s come back as &amp;lsquo;extreme.&amp;rsquo; The Fluke will actually give you &amp;lsquo;loose bearing&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;bearing wear&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; it will give you the diagnosis. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the motors apart, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it, the diagnosis was right on. Then I&amp;rsquo;d also rebuild the motor, throw it on the workbench, put the 810 back on it and it comes back as either &amp;lsquo;no problem detected&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;slight wear or vibration.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Has the Fluke 810 saved money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;But being able to say there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with our equipment, troubleshoot that, get the parts on order, repair it in our downtime and bring it back up online &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s almost priceless. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that part on the shelf it could be two days out, and you&amp;rsquo;re not doing any processing. The amount you can save? It could be significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Increase profits and reduce maintenance costs for your facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Do you want to increase profits and reduce maintenance costs for your facility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is common knowledge that technologies such as vibration analysis, shaft alignment, oil analysis, thermal imaging, motor circuit testing and several other technologies are excellent tools to help achieve these results. These technologies can be used for the identification and elimination of machinery defects on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many facilities are content with the knowledge that machinery defects (bearing defects, gearbox defects, etc.) have been identified, scheduled for maintenance and ultimately repaired utilizing these technologies. An optimized reliability program will constantly seek the root causes that create the machinery defects, thereby avoiding many chronic and recurring problems. Most facilities believe that finding the root cause of equipment defects can be difficult. This may be true in some cases, but it is not always the reality. In fact, many of the actual root causes of equipment defects can be easily identified. The elimination of these root causes will reduce the amount of equipment defects that must be repaired over time, help you achieve the goal of reduced maintenance cost and increase profits at your company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is a method of finding what forcing function is causing unwanted harmful vibrations and the resulting defects in equipment. However, these defects can be very difficult to distinguish from one another when using only vibration data for identification. If the defect is not accurately identified, then incorrect or unnecessary maintenance may be completed on the equipment as a result. If the root causes are not identified, then the same repair will be repeated over time. All of this increases the overall cost of maintenance and reduces company profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Looseness-related conditions are some of the most common issues found in equipment and can be some of the easiest to correct. These conditions, if uncorrected, can create costly routine equipment defects and haunt maintenance staff. This results in continual equipment maintenance and higher repair cost. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mechanical looseness can be placed into one of two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Structural&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotating element (component looseness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Structural looseness may act as a vibration amplifier. The stiffness of the equipment or structure changes as the looseness develops and increases in severity. This can allow the resonance frequency to change and overlap with another defect frequency in the machine. This will increase the defect amplitudes and cause the equipment to fail more quickly. Damage due to this effect can be very costly and is completely avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Structural looseness can be created by base mounting issues, bearing caps, casings, supports, improper/broken welds, etc. These types of conditions are difficult to identify and determine the root cause when using only vibration patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase data can often be used to determine the exact problem in the equipment when the vibration data does not provide a clear indication. Phase analysis is one of the most overlooked capabilities that can be used to identify and locate unwanted equipment defects such as structural looseness. Therefore, phase analysis is a very valuable diagnostic tool available to the analyst and can be easily used to identify the root cause of many equipment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is critical that the analyst have a clear understanding of phase relationships before attempting any type of phase measurements. Phase is the relationship between two events in time. These events may occur in sync (in phase) or out of sync (out of phase) with each other. This distinction is very important and can easily be used to identify structural looseness issues. Phase readings collected on two measurement locations in close proximity to one another should have comparable values. Dissimilar phase values are an indication that the locations are vibrating out of sync (out of phase) with each other and looseness may be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moving the vibration sensor from one radial direction to another (vertical to horizontal) should result in approximately a 90-degree phase shift. Moving the sensor within the same radial direction (horizontal to horizontal or vertical to vertical) should result in approximately the same phase values. It is not uncommon to see a phase shift of approximately plus-or-minus 30 degrees when moving the vibration sensor from one measurement location to another, and this is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 shows equipment that has been checked for structural looseness. Notice that the measured phase readings remain very similar as the vibration sensor is moved within the same measurement plane. This indicates that no structural looseness issues are present on this side of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Equipment with no Structural Looseness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase should be measured across all bolted or welded joints. Phase readings will suddenly become erratic, from point to point, once a loose component/location is found. Often, the phase shift will change between 90 and 180 degrees from the previous measurement location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows a second machine that has been checked for structural looseness. Notice that the phase readings are very similar until a specific measurement location is reached. The phase readings suddenly change. X marks the spot, and the sudden change in phase values indicates a structural looseness issue at the specific measurement location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Equipment with Structural Looseness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase measurements can be used to identify loose mounting foot conditions in equipment as well (see Figure 3). A loose foot will show a phase shift from the foot to the foundation. Also, a phase difference from the suspect foot compared to the other machine feet should be observed. The phase shift is usually greater than 90 degrees. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another option now available to the analyst is the ability to collect relative phase measurements routinely in a route. This data can be trended over time along with other route-based measurement data (Figure 4). The trend data will show an indication as the equipment condition changes over time. This can be done without a tachometer signal by using a cross-channel phase measurement in the route. In fact, collecting route-based relative phase measurements is an excellent option for machines that have experienced expensive repairs or caused collateral damage due to looseness-related issues. This type of routine information may allow such expensive failures to be avoided and the integrity of the structure or equipment to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

	Proper preparation is imperative prior to conducting any phase measurements. The measurement locations should be clean of dirt, etc. A simple drawing should be created for identifying the desired measurement locations and recording the measured results. This drawing may be simple, but it will prove critical when analyzing the results. Figure 5 shows a simple outline that can be routinely used for phase measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Basic phase data is not difficult to acquire and can provide a wealth of information. This information will help identify many of the root cause conditions that create equipment defects at your facility. These conditions can be eliminated and, as a result, reduce the amount of routine equipment failures experienced (bearing defects, etc.). This results in overall savings in maintenance costs and increased profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are expected to reduce maintenance costs and increase profits, do not overlook the technologies you may have available or may purchase. Do not assume that all of the functionality these technologies offer is complicated to use. Not providing these technologies to your maintenance staff or underutilizing the technologies you already have available will actually lead to increased maintenance costs and reduced profits.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Meggitt Sensing Systems celebrates the 50th anniversary of Wilcoxon Research</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Meggitt Sensing Systems announced the 50th anniversary of the Maryland-based manufacturer of Meggitt&amp;rsquo;s Wilcoxon Research range of piezoelectric accelerometers and vibration sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meggitt&amp;rsquo;s Wilcoxon Research product range was established when Wilcoxon Research was founded as an independent company in 1960. Created by two scientists from the David Taylor Naval Research Center (now the Naval Surface Warfare Center), Wilcoxon Research was founded on two principles that still hold true today: 1) impeccable customer service and customer satisfaction, and 2) continuous contribution to the field of vibration instrumentation through research, development and manufacturing of high-quality, innovative products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Continuous contribution to the field of vibration instrumentation can be demonstrated throughout the history of Wilcoxon Research. More than 20 unique innovations can be attributed to Wilcoxon Research, beginning in 1961 when the first piezoelectric accelerometer to incorporate an integrally-isolated base was introduced, eliminating the requirement for frequency-limiting adapters. In 1965, Wilcoxon Research pioneered the area of underwater piezoelectric accelerometers and introduced the first accelerometer specifically designed for underwater use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While naval applications of piezoelectric sensors are still a strong focus, Wilcoxon Research products took a new direction in the 1980s and expanded the development of industrial accelerometers. Through key innovations such as the first piezoelectric velocity sensor in 1983, Wilcoxon Research opened the market for industrial machinery health monitoring. Today, most new designs are for industrial condition monitoring and predictive maintenance applications, and include products that have recently made headlines such as the first stand-alone 4-20 mA vibration displacement sensor for machinery monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I am proud to be part of our history of significant contributions to the field of vibration monitoring,&amp;rdquo; said Derek Carbin, general manager. &amp;ldquo;And I am honored to lead our ongoing research and development as we continue to advance piezoelectric accelerometers for naval, aerospace, measurement, and industrial condition monitoring uses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2004, Meggitt PLC, an international aerospace, defense and energy group, acquired Wilcoxon Research. The Wilcoxon Research product range is now managed and marketed by Meggitt Sensing Systems, a brand-new Meggitt division, specializing in sensing and monitoring systems that measure physical parameters in extreme environments.

            <title>Kinetic Systems offers vibration surveys for sensitive equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems Inc., a manufacturer of vibration-control workstations and optical tables, offers vibration surveys for new buildings or existing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ascertain potentially damaging vibration amplitudes and frequencies in customer facilities, engineers from Kinetic Systems conduct thorough on-site surveys using a portable Fourier analyzer, high-sensitivity accelerometers, and advanced data-acquisition systems. They measure vertical and horizontal vibrations over the required frequency range and average the data over time to produce amplitude and velocity spectra of the facility&amp;rsquo;s normal vibration levels. Further analysis takes into account the weights, &amp;ldquo;footprints,&amp;rdquo; cg (centers of gravity), and expected uses of the devices to be protected, as well as the maximum allowable vibration and other specifications from equipment manufacturers. Kinetic Systems engineers are also trained to perform more advanced testing with impulse-response techniques when necessary. Finally, the data is plotted on graphs (log-scale, narrow-bandwidth spectrums, modified to octave or third-octave bands) and supplied to the customer in a complete report. If vibration control is recommended, the report will detail the degree of protection necessary and how to provide an efficient, cost-effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems provides vibration-isolation equipment for high-precision work such as biotechnology research, certain manufacturing operations (optics, semiconductors, etc.), and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems is a leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of vibration isolation equipment, optical tables, and related components.

            <title>An introduction to machinery vibration</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In simplest terms, vibration in motorized equipment is merely the back and forth movement or oscillation of machines and components, such as drive motors, driven devices (pumps, compressors and so on) and the bearings, shafts, gears, belts and other elements that make up mechanical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration in industrial equipment can be both a sign and a source of trouble. Other times, vibration just &amp;ldquo;goes with the territory&amp;rdquo; as a normal part of machine operation, and should not cause undue concern. But how can the plant maintenance professional tell the difference between acceptable, normal vibration and the kind of vibration that requires immediate attention to service or replace troubled equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a basic understanding of vibration and its causes &amp;ndash; and equipped with a vibration testing device &amp;ndash; the maintenance professional can quickly and reliably determine the cause and severity of most machine vibration and receive recommendations for repair. It&amp;rsquo;s all done with the intelligence built into the tester, without the extensive monitoring and recording required for typical, long-term vibration monitoring programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration is not always a problem. In some tasks, vibration is essential. Machines such as oscillating sanders and vibratory tumblers use vibration to remove materials and finish surfaces. Vibratory feeders use vibration to move materials. In construction, vibrators are used to help concrete settle into forms and compact fill materials. Vibratory rollers help compress asphalt used in highway paving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other cases, vibration is inherent in machine design. For instance, some vibration is almost unavoidable in the operation of reciprocating pumps and compressors, internal combustion engines, and gear drives. In a well-engineered, well-maintained machine, such vibration should be no cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke101.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When vibration is a problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Most industrial devices are engineered to operate smoothly and avoid vibration, not produce it. In these machines, vibration can indicate problems or deterioration in the equipment. If the underlying causes are not corrected, the unwanted vibration itself can cause additional damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we are focused not on machines that are &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to vibrate as part of normal operation, but on those that should not vibrate: electric motors, rotary pumps and compressors, and fans and blowers. In these devices, smoother operation is generally better, and a machine running with zero vibration is the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most common causes of machine vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Vibration can result from a number of conditions, acting alone or in combination. Keep in mind that vibration problems may be caused by auxiliary equipment, not just the primary equipment. These are some of the major causes of vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Imbalance &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; A &amp;ldquo;heavy spot&amp;rdquo; in a rotating component will cause vibration when the unbalanced weight rotates around the machine&amp;rsquo;s axis, creating a centrifugal force. Imbalance could be caused by manufacturing defects (machining errors, casting flaws) or maintenance issues (deformed or dirty fan blades, missing balance weights). As machine speed increases, the effects of imbalance become greater. Imbalance can severely reduce bearing life as well as cause undue machine vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Misalignment/shaft runout &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Vibration can result when machine shafts are out of line. Angular misalignment occurs when the axes of (for example) a motor and pump are not parallel. When the axes are parallel but not exactly aligned, the condition is known as parallel misalignment. Misalignment may be caused during assembly or develop over time, due to thermal expansion, components shifting or improper reassembly after maintenance. The resulting vibration may be radial or axial (in line with the axis of the machine) or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wear &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; As components such as ball or roller bearings, drive belts or gears become worn, they may cause vibration. When a roller bearing race becomes pitted, for instance, the bearing rollers will cause a vibration each time they travel over the damaged area. A gear tooth that is heavily chipped or worn, or a drive belt that is breaking down, can also produce vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Looseness &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Vibration that might otherwise go unnoticed may become obvious and destructive if the component that is vibrating has loose bearings or is loosely attached to its mounts. Such looseness may or may not be caused by the underlying vibration. Whatever its cause, looseness can allow any vibration present to cause damage, such as further bearing wear, wear and fatigue in equipment mounts and other components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effects of vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The effects of vibration can be severe. Unchecked machine vibration can accelerate rates of wear (i.e. reduce bearing life) and damage equipment. Vibrating machinery can create noise, cause safety problems and lead to degradation in plant working conditions. Vibration can cause machinery to consume excessive power and may damage product quality. In the worst cases, vibration can damage equipment so severely as to knock it out of service and halt plant production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet there is a positive aspect to machine vibration. Measured and analyzed correctly, vibration can be used in a preventive maintenance program as an indicator of machine condition, and help guide the plant maintenance professional to take remedial action before disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characteristics of vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To understand how vibration manifests itself, consider a simple rotating machine like an electric motor. The motor and shaft rotate around the axis of the shaft, which is supported by a bearing at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One key consideration in analyzing vibration is the direction of the vibrating force. In our electric motor, vibration can occur as a force applied in a radial direction (outward from the shaft) or in an axial direction (parallel to the shaft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An imbalance in the motor, for instance, would most likely cause a radial vibration as the &amp;ldquo;heavy spot&amp;rdquo; in the motor rotates, creating a centrifugal force that tugs the motor outward as the shaft rotates through 360 degrees. A shaft misalignment could cause vibration in an axial direction (back and forth along the shaft axis), due to misalignment in a shaft coupling device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key factor in vibration is amplitude, or how much force or severity the vibration has. The farther out of balance our motor is, the greater its amplitude of vibration. Other factors, such as speed of rotation, can also affect vibration amplitude. As rotation rate goes up, the imbalance force increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequency refers to the oscillation rate of vibration, or how rapidly the machine tends to move back and forth under the force of the condition or conditions causing the vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequency is commonly expressed in cycles per minute or hertz (CPM or Hz). One Hz equals one cycle per second or 60 cycles per minute. Though we called our example motor &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo;, even this machine can exhibit a complex vibration signature. As it operates, it could be vibrating in multiple directions (radially and axially), with several rates of amplitude and frequency. Imbalance vibration, axial vibration, vibration from deteriorating roller bearings and more all could combine to create a complex vibration spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Vibration is a characteristic of virtually all industrial machines. When vibration increases beyond normal levels, it may indicate only normal wear &amp;ndash; or it may signal the need for further assessment of the underlying causes, or for immediate maintenance action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding why vibration occurs and how it manifests itself is a key first step toward preventing vibration from causing trouble in the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Fluke 810 Vibration Tester takes it from there. This advanced handheld device is designed and programmed to diagnose the most common mechanical problems of unbalance, looseness, misalignment and bearing failures in a wide variety of mechanical equipment, including motors, fans, blowers, belts and chain drives, gearboxes, couplings, pumps, compressors, closed coupled machines and spindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fluke 810 quickly detects vibration along three planes of movement, then provides a plain-text diagnosis with a recommended solution. The diagnostic technology in the Fluke 810 analyzes machine operation and identifies faults by comparing vibration data to an extensive set of rules developed over years of field experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typical vibration analyzers and software are intended for monitoring machine condition over the longer term, but they require special training and investment that may not be possible in many companies. The Fluke 810 is designed specifically for maintenance professionals who need to troubleshoot mechanical problems and quickly understand the root cause of equipment condition.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using PdM technologies to determine, optimize lube condition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The life and reliability of greased machinery depend on proper bearing lubrication. Unfortunately, inadequate grease lubrication is a very common failure mode. With greased bearings, it is difficult to determine lubricant state along with knowing when to grease, how to grease and when to stop greasing. Fortunately, predictive technologies and work processes are being successfully applied to monitor and optimize the lubrication condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improper lubrication creates energy that manifests itself as mechanical stress energy and thermal energy (heat). By analyzing this energy using predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies, much can be learned about the bearing lubrication condition. This article discusses and compares the use of ultrasonic analysis, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration signal processing techniques as means toward determining lubrication state and achieving optimum lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, this article will look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics and progression of lubrication stress,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		an overview and comparision of
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				ultrasonic analysis&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				conventional vibration analysis and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				advanced vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the strengths and weakness of each monitoring method,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics of various lubricant states obtained in a controlled test environment, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		equipment lubrication case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traditional greasing programs use time-based preventive maintenance (PM). This method can result in over- or under-greasing, depending on the recommended periodicity of greasing, operating conditions and run time of the machinery. One plant surveyed stated that 90 percent of all motor failures were grease related &amp;ndash; both over- and under-greasing. This particular plant was using motor manufacturer recommendations as the foundation of their greasing program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An alternative greasing program uses PdM processes and technologies. Using PdM, greasing activities are based on the condition of the grease. Several PdM technologies for grease monitoring are available. Vibration tends to be the most common tool used. However, most commonly used vibration techniques do not detect early lubrication faults. Infrared is also an option, although it is not preferred since initial lubrication starvation has little impact on temperature. Some sources maintain grease sampling and analysis is the best method. However, in most circumstances, this is not practical. Many bearings do not have an access port to the grease and those that do present their own problems. The grease samples taken most likely do not represent the true condition of the grease inside the bearing and may also contain particulate and contamination picked up during the sampling. Ultrasonic analysis and advanced vibration signal processing are viable methods of monitoring grease condition since they measure the stress energy caused by friction between the rolling and sliding elements in the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: The Characteristics and Progression of Lubrication Stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In rolling element bearings, lubrication sound is created by friction-induced stress waves from the interaction of the roller to the race and the roller to the cage. Good roller-to-race interaction is rolling with elastohydrodynamic lubrication. Good roller-to-cage interaction is sliding with hydrodynamic lubrication. Assuming a RMS surface roughness of 0.3 micron, &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; shows that the minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-race is 1 micron, or approximately 1/75 the thickness of a human hair. The minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-cage is 10 microns. As lubrication starvation occurs, the film thickness will decrease, resulting in a greater coefficient of friction. The greater coefficient of friction creates additional energy in the form of heat and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lube sound characteristics for under-lubricated bearings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		high frequency energy,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		broadband energy, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		primarily random and non-periodic noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency domain of an under-lubricated bearing. Note the high-frequency energy hump in the 20 to 32 kilohertz (KHz) range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency and time domain for a gearbox running with an incorrectly installed oil pump. Note the high frequency in the 10 KHz to 20 KHz range. This energy probably continues to higher frequency range but shows a drop-off due to the accelerometer range and mounting conditions. The time domain shows a raised noise floor with random high spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the lubrication in a bearing degrades, the high-frequency sound characteristics change. A properly lubricated bearing creates random noise with a low noise flow. As the lubricant degrades, the noise floor begins to elevate (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 1&lt;/a&gt;). Listening to a heterodyned 30 KHz signal, the sound is like a waterfall or rushing river. As the lube degrades, spiking begins as the noise floor elevates which sounds like a mild popping sound (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 2&lt;/a&gt;). Severe lubrication faults cause more frequent high-amplitude spikes, which sound like bacon sizzling. In Chart 2, as grease was added, the noise floor immediately lowered and the spiking disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do not expect bearing to display the same sound characteristics. The amplitudes, sound patterns and frequencies of the stress energy are influenced by factors such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bearing geometry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Roller design and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Load&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cage design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Type of lubricant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following summarizes key points related to the characteristics of lubrication sound/stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		As lubrication condition degrades, stress energy increases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication stress energy is broadband, high frequency (about 8 KHz and higher) and random.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Other sources of high-frequency stress energy exist, such as:
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Bearing/gear defects, electrical &amp;ndash; periodic&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Rubs, fluid turbulence &amp;ndash; random&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; To evaluate lube condition, high-frequency diagnostic tools that can measure and differentiate random from periodic noise are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: Overview and Comparison of Ultrasonic Analysis, Conventional Vibration Analysis, and Advanced Vibration Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When monitoring for lubrication faults, sensor selection is critical. Sensors are not the same, so the characteristics of a sensor must be understood. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt; shows the sensor performance of several different diagnostic technologies. The red broad-band sensor would be a poor choice because the high-frequency sounds would be drowned out by the low-frequency noise. The blue narrow-band sensor in the bearing fault area would completely miss any lubricant stress noise. The black broad-band sensor represents a typical accelerometer. It may have a response in the lubrication range, but mounting techniques are critical (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;). The blue narrow-band sensor in the lubrication area has good sensitivity and completely isolates itself from lower-frequency noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt; shows that when using an accelerometer to monitor lubrication stress, either a flat magnet on a clean machined surface or a permanently mounted accelerometer must be used to get the required frequency response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five technologies to identify and monitor lubrication faults are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Infrared thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening using an accelerometer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ultrasonic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conventional vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Vibration analysis with advanced signal processing using PeakVue and Autocorrelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next few paragraphs will briefly introduce each of these technologies. This will be followed by side-by-side comparison test results for the latter three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is good for detecting possible late-stage lubrication problems. It is not good for catching lubrication problems early. Also, additional technologies will be required to confirm the source of the abnormal temperature signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some vibration analyzers have a headphone output to listen to the accelerometer output (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;). This can be used to listen to the noise within the bearing. A high-pass filter on the sound output is very useful to filter out the low-frequency noise so that the lubrication noise can be heard. This is a quick qualitative method that provides good signal pattern information. It can also indicate a drop in volume, while greasing can indicate that the grease has reached the rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic monitoring provides both listening capability and quantitative measurements (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt;). The ultrasonic sound is heterodyned into our listening range, and specific sound parameters are measured. The ultrasonic device should isolate the higher frequencies and filter out all lower-frequency noise. If the ultrasonic device uses a narrow-band sensor or resonant sensor, mounting is much easier than with an accelerometer. Generally, just placing the probe on a clean surface provides a good signal. Paint and other obstructions will lower the signal amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conventional vibration analysis analyzes macro vibration &amp;ndash; the motion of a body. It focuses on the lower-frequency events. For an 1,800 rpm motor, a typical maximum frequency would be 60 times running speed, or 1,800 hertz (Hz). &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 9&lt;/a&gt; shows a typical frequency domain plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CSI PeakVue measurement is an advanced signal-processing method. It performs micro vibration analysis, which measures the microscopic movement (stress waves) within a body. It analyzes the energy above the conventional analysis range. PeakVue is not an averaging process, so it captures the true peak amplitude values from the high-frequency information. To create the PeakVue time waveform, the accelerometer signal is routed through a high-pass filter to cut out all low-frequency information. The signal is sampled at more than 100,000 times per second. This digital data stream is broken into data blocks which are a function of the desired Fmax. The only value saved for each data block is the true peak &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; amplitude value. These true peak G levels create the PeakVue time waveform. This PeakVue time waveform is then processed to create a PeakVue frequency domain spectrum (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PeakVue provides a window into the area where lubrication data is located. The nature of lubrication faults make the PeakVue time domain data noisy and difficult to interpret. To assist with this, another advanced signal-processing technique, CSI Autocorrelation, can be applied. Autocorrelation is an averaging process to remove random activity from the time domain. The resultant correlation factor (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11&lt;/a&gt;) is proportional to the amount of periodic energy. If at any point on the correlated waveform the correlation factor is small, then almost all of the energy at that point is random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12&lt;/a&gt; shows a test motor. To compare ultrasonic, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration analysis, the top inboard bearing was monitoring both with and without lubricant. The next few paragraphs will compare the results from the three technologies. For the vibration measurements, a mounting pad was glued to a machine flat on the bearing housing. A flat magnet with accelerometer was attached to the pad. A CSI SonicScan was the ultrasonic test device. It measured both lower-frequency energy (4 KHz) and ultrasonic energy (30 KHz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13&lt;/a&gt; compares the time domain data for the three technologies. The conventional vibration data shows almost no difference between lubrication states. PeakVue clearly measures the stress energy caused by the lubrication fault. The SonicScan data was consistent. The lower-frequency energy measurement showed some but little change. The ultrasonic data showed significant change in both the average reading and peak amplitude reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the frequency domains. With conventional vibration, a slight change in periodic activity is noticed. This is likely because the existing bearing mechanical defects are being amplified a little without lubricant. The PeakVue spectrum shows a dramatic increase in stress energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PeakVue time domain for the no-lubricant condition is messy and hard to interpret. When the Autocorrelation is performed (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15&lt;/a&gt;), it is immediately apparent that almost all of the stress energy is random, which is a primary characteristic of lubrication faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Table 1 provides a summary comparison of the discussed technologies. The left side of the table shows technology features that make testing accurate and easy. Accelerometer listening and conventional vibration analysis will not provide good results. Headphones should be used when performing advanced vibration analysis to add a very important qualitative attribute. Advanced vibration analysis provides the best information for determining lubrication condition but requires additional vibration analysis training and special sensor mounting. Ultrasonics provides a good indication of lubrication condition (without access to detailed signature analysis tools) and are easy to use but also require some specialized training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: Characteristics of Various Lubricant States Obtained in a Controlled Test Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To better understand and verify theoretical assumption, a lubrication test stand was built for controlled lubrication testing. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 16&lt;/a&gt; shows the test stand that was used to collect the controlled grease lubrication testing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor drives a control, idler and test bearing. Grease can be introduced into each bearing through its outer race using a zerk fitting on the bearing housing. The idler bearing can be variably loaded to 1,000 pounds. The bearings tested were sealed SKF single-row ball bearings with nine balls. The bearings have an ABEC 1 rating and were driven at 1,780 rpm. For each lubrication condition, peak and average decibel (dB) levels were measured at three frequency ranges. The ranges were 30 kHz (lubrication range), 4 kHz (impact range) and 40 kHz (traditional ultrasonic range). The peak dB level records the highest signal amplitude, such as in a spike, during a data collection period. The average dB level records the average of all the signal peaks during a data collection period and is least affected by spikes. The sound parameters were collected using a Model 7100 SonicScan analyzer using a magnet mount sensor. A magnet mount sensor allowed for hands-free operation and greater repeatability. The temperature was monitored on the bearing housing using a CSI Model 515 spot radiometer with laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, to evaluate the effects on sound of over-lubrication, a new bearing running at steady state under load was slowly greased until grease squeezed through the seals (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 18&lt;/a&gt; shows no significant increase in sound up to 12 minutes after over-greasing. Over-greasing did create a 7 percent rise in the temperature on the outside of the bearing housing. It should be noted that the rate of grease oxidation and deterioration will increase with increasing temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, to evaluate the effects of under-lubrication, a new bearing with seals removed was brought to steady-state temperature under full load. The bearing was stopped long enough to wipe grease off of one side of the bearing and then retested. The bearing was then washed in solvent to remove all grease (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 19&lt;/a&gt;) and then retested. When the bearing with no grease was approaching total failure, it was progressively regreased and monitored for 30 minutes until it reached steady state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt; shows results from lubricant starvation and then re-lubrication. The dB levels increase with deteriorating lube conditions and they decrease with improving lubrication conditions. The temperature remains constant except when lubricant is absent. While temperature is a good indicator of total lube starvation, it was not a good indicator of partial lube starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seen from &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt;, the initial re-lubrication made a significant improvement in sound level and temperature even though only one pump, or 0.04 ounces of grease, was introduced. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 21&lt;/a&gt; shows the sound waveform (heterodyned 30 kHz audio output from SonicScan) immediately prior to and after the first pump of grease. A very distinct drop in level occurs when the grease hits the rollers. Additional greasing resulted in a minor sound level decrease and a negligible effect on temperature. Permanent damage likely occurred to the bearing since the sound levels did not return to their original levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in a controlled environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a poor technology for monitoring over-lubrication since over-lubrication does not significantly affect the sound parameters,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature analysis is a good technology for monitoring over-lubrication since it does significantly increase with over-greasing; however, in the field, be aware of process and environmental effects on the temperature,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a good technology for monitoring normal and under-lubricated bearings since the sound levels increase with deteriorating conditions and decrease with improving conditions,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication problems that are not corrected in early stages will result in permanent mechanical damage, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening during greasing for a decrease in the sound level is a good indicator of grease entering the bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: Equipment Lubrication Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication ultrasonic analysis was performed on the following operating industrial equipment: food processing conveyor bearings, 75-horsepower General Electric motors, and 450 HP Baldor motor. The conveyor testing occurred during a single day, while the motor testing occurred over a seven-month period. The testing confirmed and validated the characteristics of lubrication sound and the findings from the controlled environment testing. The instrument used to analyze the sound was a CSI Model 7100 SonicScan with a multi-frequency contact probe (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 22&lt;/a&gt;) instead of a magnet mount sensor. Measurements were taken on the top of the zerk fitting. In general, contact probe measurements are not as repeatable as magnet mount sensor because of variable contact angles and pressures. The advantage of the contact probe is that it can easily fit into tight places and can be used on zerk fittings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Processing Conveyor Bearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The survey included 13 bearings from a conveyor in a food processing plant. Most of the bearings were pressure-washed frequently with water and greased daily. Bearing No. 11 was elevated above floor level, in a difficult-to-reach position, and apparently not greased regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each bearing was tested three times before greasing and three times after greasing. Of all the bearings that were greased daily, the additional greasing had little or no effect on the bearing sound. Greasing significantly affected bearing No. 11. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 23&lt;/a&gt; shows a summary of the readings taken at both the 4 kHz and 30 kHz frequency ranges. It also shows the peak (PH) and average (AV) readings at each frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For each set of columns, the first column shows the mean dB reading of all 13 bearings. The second column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 before greasing. The third column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 after greasing. In both the 4 kHz peak and 4 kHz average readings, bearing No. 11 was slighter higher than mean before greasing and slightly lower than mean after greasing. The 30 kHz peak reading shows a significantly elevated dB before greasing and a significant dB drop after greasing. The greatest change occurred with the 30 kHz average reading with the average reading dropping from the upper 20s to almost zero. In this test, the 30 kHz average reading was the most sensitive parameter for measuring lubrication condition. It should also be noted that permanent mechanical damage was unlikely since the 4 kHz peak (mechanical impact) reading dropped to below mean and the 30 kHz average (lubrication) reading dropped to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headphones were used with the SonicScan to provide additional qualitative information. Unfortunately, in this environment, a lot of noise existed in all of the measurements. Metal cans were clattering on the conveyor, belts were sliding and the background was loud. For these or other reasons, the headphones did not provide useful information in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;75 HP General Electric Motors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 75 HP General Electric motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive blowers. Each bearing has a single shield toward the rotor. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 12 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 24&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. Notice that the inboard bearing dB level dropped to almost zero after greasing and remained constant through 766 hours. The outboard bearing performed similarly except that the dB level began to increase after 358 hours. This could be caused by a lot of factors, such as possibly only a small amount of the grease that entered the cavity actually made to it the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 25&lt;/a&gt; shows a similar plot for a second 75 HP General Electric motor. The 30 kHz sound level performed as expected. The 4 kHz dB level seemed to not be affected by greasing. The 4 kHz dB levels very likely can be affected by noise from other machinery and processes since sonic sound travels through material much better and attenuates much slower than ultrasonic signals. The 40 kHz signal did not perform as expected. In general, the 40 kHz signal is less reliable since the amount of lubrication energy created at 40 kHz is less than what is created at 30 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;450 HP Baldor Motor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 450 HP Baldor Super E motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive large blowers. Each bearing is neither shielded nor sealed. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock. Access to the grease vents is restricted because of the design of the motor mount. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 24 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 26&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. At 3,411 hours, the bearing was greased &amp;ndash; first four pumps and then an additional four pumps. With the 30 kHz readings, the sound levels dropped significantly, while they increased slightly with additional grease. Because of this increase, greasing was stopped. Only after 552 hours, the sound level returned to its previous level, that is most likely a state of adequate lubrication. Like with the GE motors, the 4 kHz sound was not affected by the greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 27&lt;/a&gt; charts another Baldor motor bearing. At 30 kHz, this bearing has a steady sound level until 3,278 hours. After greasing, the sound level dropped back close to the previous level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in an industrial environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In all of the GE and Baldor bearings, the 30 kHz average reading provided the most predictable readings. The 40 kHz readings generally followed the 30 kHz readings but were less consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greasing did not affect the 4 kHz readings. The 4 kHz reading can be very useful in analyzing the bearing&amp;rsquo;s mechanical condition or as a confirmation technique for conventional vibration analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Trying to determine lubrication condition by listening alone is ineffective since the lubrication sound is primarily white noise. Quantifiable and repeatable analysis is required to accurately assess lubrication condition. The qualitative information from listening is very useful for general listening and checking for other problems. It can also be useful during lubrication to determine when grease enters the bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		For all of the industrial bearings tested, optimum or baseline lubrication levels (30 kHz frequency and average sound parameter) were around 10 dB or lower. The normal operating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lubrication levels were around 10 to 20 dB. For the test stands bearing and conveyor bearing, the critical level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;before permanent damage occurred was around 30 dB. This would imply that the greasing level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;should occur between 20 and 30 dB. These estimates are very general. More exact levels should be determined by type of bearing and application. This could be accomplished through testing and long-term trending.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All the bearing testing did not exhibit a standard lubrication cycle except that increasing hours eventually resulted in increasing sound levels and that re-lubrication resulted in decreasing sound levels except for the case of already over-lubricated bearings. Specific lubrication cycles for specific bearings could be understood through long-term trending. This would provide much information on the real-time lubrication condition and projected performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By trending the sound levels along with the lubrication intervals and grease amounts, the grease interval and volume can be optimized. The most favorable temperatures will be obtained when the bearing is supplied with the minimum quantity of lubricant to provide proper lubrication. Therefore, as a general rule, less grease is better than more grease. The trending will reveal the cause and effect of lubrication quantity on lubrication condition and interval. Lubrication monitoring with vibration was performed on a pump, scrubber fan and exhaust blower.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 28&lt;/a&gt; shows the conventional vibration data for a pump. This data shows no indication of a lubrication fault. The PeakVue data for the same pump shows high G levels and random patterns which could indicate a lubrication fault (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 29&lt;/a&gt;). The autocorrelation of the PeakVue waveform confirms that the energy is almost all random (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 30&lt;/a&gt;). The pump locked up one month later due to lack of lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next vibration case history is for a scrubber fan. The PeakVue data on April 19 (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 31&lt;/a&gt;) was below the alert level. On May 29, the PeakVue data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 32&lt;/a&gt;) was in alarm with a 500 percent increase in G amplitude. The autocorrelation of the May 29 data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 33&lt;/a&gt;) revealed no periodicity. This random high-frequency energy is a strong indicator of a lubrication fault. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 34&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the PeakVue time waveforms. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 35&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the conventional time waveform data. Note that no increase occurred with the conventional data (Fmax of 3 KHz). The source of the lubrication fault was a faulty oiler bowl. As soon as the oiler bowl was fixed, the PeakVue data returned to normal levels (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third vibration equipment case study is for an exhaust blower. A new type of grease with limestone and graphite additives was used. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 37&lt;/a&gt; shows the frequency domain before and after the new grease was added. The new grease caused significant high-frequency energy &amp;ndash; 8 KHz and higher. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 38&lt;/a&gt; shows the PeakVue time domain comparison. Notice the large increase in friction energy because of the different lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These three equipment case studies show that advanced vibration analysis using PeakVue and autocorrelation are effective techniques to identify and monitor lubrication condition. They also show that conventional vibration analysis is not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To achieve optimum lubrication, it is important to be able to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the lubrication condition at any time;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the conditions when re-lubrication is necessary;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the volume of grease required for re-greasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As seen from this article, multiple predictive technologies can provide immediate information about the lubrication condition while the equipment is operating. Each of these technologies has strengths and limitations. For effective lubrication monitoring, each of the technology&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses must be understood along with the physical characteristics of lubrication energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication analysis using advanced vibration analysis should be performed on all critical machines, especially if the equipment is already being monitored for bearing defects. If equipment is critical enough to warrant vibration analysis, then the lubrication can be monitored as a part of that process. Many companies do not monitor lubrication because of the cost to prepare a proper mounting surface for the accelerometer. This cost is insignificant when compared to the cost of a lubrication fault in terms of lost production, lost equipment life and higher maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When lubrication analysis is combined with good trending and monitoring, greasing intervals and amounts can be optimized. All of this results in knowing the equipment better and being better able to maintain it, extend its life, and predict its performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Poll finds challenges with PdM sustainability can overshadow successes </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on April 1 announced the results of a survey aimed at gaining insight into the state of predictive maintenance and condition monitoring programs among U.S. plants. Overall findings show that while a majority (76 percent) of respondents is satisfied with current programs, more than half of those surveyed agree that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know exactly what solutions and tools are needed to maintain a successful program. Combined with insufficient staff, limited in-house expertise and poor training as the top factors negatively impacting results, plants must re-examine existing programs now in order to ensure sustainability and the ability to meet long-term productivity and reliability goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The findings of Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s inaugural &amp;ldquo;State of the Condition Monitoring Industry&amp;rdquo; report are based on a survey conducted among engineers and plant managers. Of those surveyed, 65 percent have a machine condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place. The top three components of those programs are vibration analysis/monitoring, lube oil analysis and thermography. Of those who don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a program in place, 16 percent plan to start one this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reaching the C-Suite&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While the majority of respondents agree that predictive maintenance programs directly impact the bottom line, when queried about barriers to success, difficulty demonstrating ROI was one of the top factors. This could be directly related to other issues such as insufficient staff and limited budget support, but nonetheless, ROI remains an important measure of program traction that resonates with the C-suite. Therefore, plants must adopt the right technology and partner services to enable managers to better capture and report the benefits of condition monitoring programs, focusing on metrics such as decreased downtime, improved productivity, and cost savings related to improved equipment health and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outsourcing Predicted to Rise&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For those with a condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place, just over half of the respondents use a combination of in-house and outsourced solutions. While only 8 percent currently outsourcing data collection and analysis, based on this survey, outsourcing may be on the rise. Of those handling programs in-house, 53 percent responded that they believe there are benefits to outsourcing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In considering a partner for third-party support, the following factors were ranked, in order of importance, as most influential in making that decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analytical software and services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ability to speak with a customer service representative 24/7&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Advanced reporting capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Web-based or on-demand access to data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;While the benefits of an effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance program are clear to plant personnel and management, many programs have been left on auto-pilot during tight economic times,&amp;rdquo; said Burt Hurlock, CEO, Azima DLI. &amp;ldquo;We believe one of the keys to long-term success is greater visibility among the C-suite regarding the quantifiable impact these programs can have on productivity and plants&amp;rsquo; ability to comply with important industry standards for reliability. For example, by investing in cost-effective data collection analysis capabilities, plants can make informed maintenance decisions and generate results in terms of cost-avoidance related to unscheduled downtime and unnecessary repairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Consistency plays critical role in Ash Grove reliability program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Broken equipment is a cement producer&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy, causing lost time, productivity and money. While many of these problems can be avoided through an effective predictive maintenance (PdM) program, operators are often hesitant to implement one due to the up-front and ongoing investment required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Ken Rone, vice president of manufacturing services at Ash Grove Cement, a PdM investment is well worth the costs, paying for itself every time equipment failure and downtime is avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building the foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Overland Park, Kan., Ash Grove Cement has nearly 9 million tons of cement capacity and is considered a leader in the U.S. cement industry. The company was founded more than 125 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove first started its corporate Maintenance Excellence Process (MEP) in 2000, establishing standardized PdM equipment and procedures at each of its 10 U.S. plants. What varied was the staffing and consistency of data reporting. Some locations relied on onsite technical personnel while others used third-party consultants for various levels of vibration analysis, infrared thermography and oil analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had a high-level, sophisticated program, but we identified vibration analysis as a weak link where we lacked consistency,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to bring in an independent third party with expertise in this area and began evaluating potential partners in August 2008. We were ready to go with Timken in early 2009.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken is a technical solutions provider focused on improving uptime in industrial equipment. By applying its extensive knowledge of metallurgy, tribology, engineering and data analysis, Timken engineers help to maximize reliability and energy efficiency in machines critical to plant operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re at our best when we can bring all our knowledge together to solve a problem,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Brooks, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;When we combine optimal bearing, sealing and lubrication technology with things like proper maintenance, condition monitoring and diagnostic analysis, we really start seeing better results in how our customers&amp;rsquo; equipment performs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ohio-based company also offers in-depth training and consulting services, working with customers to develop a program that suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken was the right choice for us because of their consulting experience,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;Their evaluation devices also use the same technology platform as our existing PdM equipment, so we were already compatible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing a new baseline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One challenge Ash Grove had was consistently collecting baseline readings for vibration analysis levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s critical to establish baselines for trending purposes,&amp;rdquo; said Tod Cotter, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;Once the baselines are in place, you have something to compare future readings to &amp;ndash; if the amplitude of the readings trend upward, that&amp;rsquo;s when a problem might be occurring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing this, Ash Grove asked Timken&amp;rsquo;s reliability experts to establish baseline vibration analysis readings and provide consistent, verifiable data for Criticality 1 and Criticality 2 equipment at each plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cotter collected the data and performed analysis on all machines of 1,000 horsepower or more. He then made recommendations for changes in maintenance scheduling and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Based on our findings, we provided an audit of what was good and bad at each location,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;Each plant had different equipment and operating parameters, but the process helped us identify existing best practices that could be shared among all the facilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the Ash Grove plants in Leamington, Utah, and Seattle stood out as having solid vibration analysis programs managed by a combination of in-house technicians and outside contractors. Their effective processes were highlighted in Timken&amp;rsquo;s recommendations and later incorporated into operations at other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding the collaboration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Impressed with Timken&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise and suggestions, Rone asked the company if it would be willing to help manage predictive maintenance activities at four Ash Grove plants having issues with their existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our approach is to establish a collaboration, not just come in and dictate what a company should do,&amp;rdquo; said Brooks. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re glad to work with Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s people &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; to come up with a custom plan that helps them keep their critical assets running.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan is working. In the first 10 months alone, Timken and Ash Grove discovered 10 instances in which equipment critical to plant operations was starting to fail. These discoveries enabled maintenance personnel to make repairs and replace damaged components before a problem could cause unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Avoiding breakdowns in major equipment such as kilns, crushers and fans has the potential to save Ash Grove millions of dollars. One &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; on a raw mill motor at the Leamington plant helped the company avoid approximately $350,000 in downtime costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another case, Timken helped Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s plant in Foreman, Ark., avoid an estimated 12 hours of downtime by analyzing data that indicated a fault in a ball mill&amp;rsquo;s fan gearbox. Removal of the gearbox bearing, which showed severe pitting damage, confirmed a problem. Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s maintenance personnel replaced the gearbox before it led to a total system shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove also has made the switch to Timken&amp;rsquo;s machine evaluator for data collection. The machine evaluator is a handheld instrument that combines sophisticated vibration analysis with shock-pulse monitoring to detect bearing damage and inadequate lubrication, as well as many other problems with mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Shock-pulse works particularly well for monitoring conditions in slow-speed cement equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;The machine evaluator has advanced diagnosis capabilities for detecting machine faults such as imbalance, misalignment and structural weaknesses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove maintenance personnel and onsite technicians also are receiving training on how to use the machine evaluator and integrate it into a comprehensive PdM program. Additional training related to maintenance and reliability is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rone said training was a differentiating factor that helped Ash Grove select Timken, and Timken&amp;rsquo;s willingness to share its technical knowledge has translated into real business value. He also believes that the most successful PdM programs are consistent and ongoing. For example, part of Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s MEP strategy is to reconfirm its vibration analysis baselines annually, with the help of Timken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken has definitely helped us strengthen our PdM practices,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;With their onsite support and accurate data reporting, our own people have more confidence in their decision making. Right from the start, Timken demonstrated a level of technical know-how that is helping us achieve best-in-class results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF provides critical machinery vibration monitoring and protection solution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers the Multilog On-line System DMx, a multi-featured vibration monitor for both conventional and hazardous environments. Awarded ATEX, IECEx, and cULus certifications, the DMx monitoring system can be directly installed within a hazardous area, removing or reducing cabling, cabinets and isolation barriers, and ultimately saving time and money during installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Multilog DMx system combines both protection (to help avoid catastrophic failures) and condition monitoring functionality in a single device, making it ideal for monitoring critical machinery such as gas turbines, generator sets, motors, pumps and compressors in the hydrocarbon processing Industry (HPI), power generation industry and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, field-installed intrinsically safe vibration devices have been confined to simple transmitters that provide only basic machine health information,&amp;rdquo; said Chris James, business area director, SKF Reliability Systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The complexity of the vibration measurement has been in conflict with the power restrictions imposed by intrinsic safety. With the DMx, we&amp;#39;ve been able to resolve this conflict and offer a vibration monitoring solution that &amp;ndash; for the first time &amp;ndash; allows the requirements of critical machinery monitoring, from transducer to dynamic data processing, to be fulfilled by an intrinsically safe device located on the machine skid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Multilog DMx system&amp;rsquo;s modular design, distributed architecture and small footprint have cost and installation advantages over traditional 19-inch rack systems, including energy savings due to the low power consumption of this intrinsically safe device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Features include four dynamic input channels for vibration, axial thrust and dynamic pressure, with two channels for speed/phase measurements. Multiple LEDs provide local indications of module, channel and alarm status and diagnostic data. The device can be easily connected to plant control and information networks by common protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Multilog DMx functions as an independent monitor or as a complete system connecting to plant-wide fieldbus infrastructure and SKF&amp;rsquo;s asset management tool &amp;ndash; @ptitude Monitoring Suite. The DMx has been adopted in many HPI sites around the world for critical plant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 steps to diagnose a soft foot condition on machinery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis can be used to determine if a soft foot condition exists on a machine that is running. If you cannot shut the machine down to check for soft foot, using the simple procedure outlined in this article will help determine if soft foot is your problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mount your accelerometer on the suspected soft foot.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the live monitoring mode of your vibration analyzer to monitor the 1x rotation speed vibration. Use enough resolution to distinguish the desired peak, but not so much that it requires long collection time between averages.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While monitoring the 1x vibration, loosen the mounting bolt to approximately hand-tight.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the vibration at 1x rotational speed reduces significantly in amplitude, it is very likely that you have a soft foot condition.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Retighten the mounting bolt and schedule the appropriate corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When corrections are not made to eliminate a soft foot condition, the foot will deflect when tightened. This will affect the alignment and the motor air gap, and can cause significant vibration at rotational speed. By loosening the foot while running, the force deflecting the foot is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/FubOLhqrgCQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Airbus explores vibration with flutter test</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most dangerous events that can occur in flight is a phenomena called &amp;quot;flutter&amp;quot;. Flutter is an aerodynamically induced vibration of a wing, tail, or control surface that can result in total structural failure in a matter of seconds. The prediction of flutter is not a precise science and requires flight verification that flutter will not occur within the normal flight envelope.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The aerodynamic surfaces of an airplane are constructed so that they can carry the loads that are produced in flight. For example the wing must be capable of supporting the weight of the airplane as well as the additional lift produced during turning flight. The resulting wing structure can be viewed as a blade or spring extending from the fuselage. If we &amp;quot;tap&amp;quot; the spring with a hammer, it will vibrate at a frequency which relates to the stiffness of the spring. A stiff spring will vibrate at a higher frequency than a more limber spring. This frequency is known as the &amp;quot;natural frequency&amp;quot; of the spring.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Flutter will usually occur at or near the natural frequency of the structure, that is, some small aerodynamic force will cause the structure to vibrate at its natural frequency. If this small force persists at the same frequency as the natural frequency of the structure, a condition called &amp;quot;resonance&amp;quot; occurs. Under a resonant condition, the amplitude of the vibration will increase dramatically in a very short time and can cause catastrophic failure in the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to troubleshoot bearing defect frequencies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When learning vibration analysis, we are taught that determining bearing defect frequencies is as simple as a mathematical formula. Simply input some numbers and presto! While this is the fundamental technique needed to determine these frequencies, there are some other important considerations that need to be made. If you find that you have a frequency that you believe is a defective bearing but you just cannot get the frequencies to line up with your fault frequency overlays, here are some things you need to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Check the true running speed of the machine. You may have the machine identified as an 1,800 rpm machine that is actually running at 1,780 rpm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure the bearing characteristics match those in your vibration database. Most vibration software comes with a database of bearings. You may find your bearing number in that database; however, the actual bearing may be slightly different. The bearing may have one more or one less ball than the selected bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if axial loading is occurring. High axial loading will change the roller path and thus effect the frequency calculations. As the axial load increases, the rollers have less distance to travel because they are being forced on the raceway shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if wear is an issue. As a bearing wears over time, the distance the rollers have to travel will increase as a result. The rollers will actually decrease in diameter as wear occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if you have identified the right bearing. Occasionally when equipment is rebuilt, the original bearings are replaced with a similar bearing of a different brand. This can lead to differences in bearing defect frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure you have enough resolution to separate defect frequencies from running speed harmonics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you follow these simple guidelines for determining the proper bearing defect frequencies, you will find that your fault overlay will match your suspected bearing defect frequencies a much higher percentage of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The impact of condition on motor efficiency and reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This article discusses the financial impact of motor condition on electric motor efficiency and reliability by reviewing a combination of motor circuit analysis (MCA) and vibration techniques. Cost impacts on energy, production and maintenance will be outlined. The topic will surround a utility study and U.S. Department of Energy market transformation success during 2000 and 2001. The primary areas of concern are phase balance, rotor bars, cleanliness and bearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motors are the prime mover of industry and our general comfort in commercial buildings. The motor systems consume 20 percent of all energy used in the United States and 59 percent of all electricity generated. Within each sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		78% of electrical energy in industrial systems (greater than 90% in process industries)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		43% of the electrical energy in commercial buildings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		37% of the electrical energy in the home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are well over 1.2 billion electric motors, of all types, used throughout the United States. However, electric motors are often out-of-sight, out-of-mind until production is down due to a burnout or catastrophic bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to understand that equipment usually fails over time, reliability decreases and losses increase (efficiency decreases) over time prior to most catastrophic failures. Although some equipment faults are instantaneous, the larger majority of catastrophic faults that impact production are the result of a failure in the implementation of a maintenance program. This failure is primarily due to management not fully understanding that maintenance is an investment in the business and not an expense of doing business. If you do not invest in materials, equipment and people, you do not have product to sell: If you do not invest in predictive maintenance practices (preventive maintenance, Total Productive Maintenance, Reliability-Centered Maintenance or any other program), you do not have product to sell or less of it at a higher overall production cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper implementation of a maintenance program has been shown to reduce energy consumption in plants by as much as 14% &lt;sup&gt;1 2&lt;/sup&gt;, while also reducing unplanned production downtime. Average downtime costs are shown as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="93" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose001.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Estimations for Downtime Costs &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a recent utility energy and reliability project, a group of electric motors from five to 200 horsepower were reviewed in several industries, including: Petroleum and Chemical; Forest Products; Food Processing; Mining (Quarry); and Pulp &amp;amp; Paper. The plants varied from having no existing planned maintenance program to full implementation, including an existing energy program. Of these motors, randomly evaluated, 80% were found to have at least one deficiency with 60% of those (48% of the original) found to be cost effective to replace. The plants without programs had the greatest number of defective motors; the plants with existing maintenance and energy programs had the least number of defective motors. Eight percent of the motors were evaluated to determine the types of faults and the potential cost avoidance with corrective action (repair or replace) by using vibration analysis and motor circuit analysis (MCA). Several had a combination of electrical and mechanical problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="59" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose002.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 2: Utility Energy Project Findings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several motors had combined vibration and electrical faults. A few had winding faults combined with insulation resistance faults. Several had shorted windings that were continuing to cause production problems, but were written off as nuisance trips (detected in the study by using MCA). &amp;ldquo;Findings of the advanced portion of the Motor PAT Tool demonstration project indicate that measuring for phase unbalance of resistance, inductance, impedance, phase angle and I/F (current/frequency response) provided more useful results.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The combined incremental production cost avoidance of 20 of the defective motors, from five to 250 horsepower, was $297,100, rendering implementation costs insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The purpose of this article is to first provide information for determining cost avoidance through the application of a maintenance program on electric motors. This will be followed with a discussion of the implementation of motor circuit analysis (MCA) and vibration analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost Avoidance through Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of ways to determine cost avoidance through the implementation of maintenance programs. In this discussion, the focus will be on the methods introduced through the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs), which provide a very basic and conservative method. The PAT Tool Demonstration Project used a much more complex method &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which is outside the scope of this article. However, some of the tools, such as MotorMaster Plus &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, will be used to provide cost information for motor repair costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utility representatives have indicated that in a survey of facilities with no preventive maintenance programs, motor rewinds represented 85% of the total number of motor repairs (on average). After preventive maintenance programs were established, the number of rewinds were reduced to about 20% of the total. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This statement has been found to hold true through research projects including: Dreisilker&amp;rsquo;s Total Motor System Maintenance and Management Program (DTM 2), the PAT Tool Project, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the purpose of this discussion, we will consider a paperboard plant with 485 motors. There are two operating production lines that have a potential downtime cost of $6,575 each. An average of three motors were repaired per month, of which a majority (70%) required rewind replacement (normally caused by immersion, contamination or the motors became coated in material). The facility operated 8,000 hours per year, with the catastrophic failures normally causing one line to fail at a time. Additional costs not covered by this discussion included cleaning of the system prior to restarting the operation. No maintenance program in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose003.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 3: Breakdown of Motor Horsepower and Repair Costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step is to calculate the unplanned production downtime costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 1: Unplanned Production Downtime Cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PC&lt;sub&gt;Downtime&lt;/sub&gt; = (MF/year) x (P&lt;sub&gt;Lost&lt;/sub&gt;/failure) x (P&lt;sub&gt;Cost&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (36 motors/year) x (4 hours/failure) x ($6,575/hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $946,800/year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Where PC is the annual cost of unplanned downtime, MF is the number of motor failures, P represents production.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 2 is to calculate the average cost of rewinding equipment. In this case, we will concentrate on just 20 horsepower and larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 2: Average Cost of Rewinding Motors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = ((N&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; x RWC&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;) + &amp;hellip; + (Nnn x RWC&lt;sub&gt;nn&lt;/sub&gt;))/N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= ((15&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; x $660&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) + (10&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; x $760&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;) + &amp;hellip; + (4&lt;sub&gt;750&lt;/sub&gt; x $7735&lt;sub&gt;750&lt;/sub&gt;)) / 138 motors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,650&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Where R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; is the average rewind cost, N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motors for each horsepower, RWC&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rewind cost for each horsepower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The average cost for reconditioning the motors is calculated the same way, except the reconditioning cost is used instead of rewind costs. For this example, the average reconditioning cost would be $555.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 3 is to calculate the average repair cost per motor before and after maintenance implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 3: Average Repair Cost per Motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = (% Recondition x $/Recondition) + (% Rewind x $/Rewind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (30% x $555) + (70% x $1,650)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,322 / motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assuming that the number of motors rewound vs. reconditioned would be inverse with the application of the program, the number of rewound motors would be 30%, and the average cost of repair would be $884 per motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the program is implemented, the number of motors to be repaired, overall, will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 4 uses the number of motors repaired per year and the difference between the reconditioned motors vs. rewound in order to come up with a conservative estimate of savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 4: Repair Cost Reduction Estimate (RRC&lt;sub&gt;est&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RRC&lt;sub&gt;est&lt;/sub&gt; = (motors repaired/year x initial repair costs) (motors repaired/year x new repair costs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (36 motors/year x $1,322/motor) (36 motors/year x $884/motor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $15,768 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 5 is to determine potential energy savings. For the purposes of conservative estimation, a 2% improvement in efficiency will be assumed. Maintenance components include (and the type of test system, vibration and MCA only, for this article, used to evaluate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved lubrication (vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper alignment and balancing (vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correction of circuit unbalances (MCA)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced motor temperatures (MCA, vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced efficiency losses caused by rewinds (U.S. Department of Energy estimates one percentage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		point efficiency reduction per rewind)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved drive system performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 5: Energy Cost Savings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy Savings = (total hp of motors considered) x (load factor) x (operating hours) x (%savings) x (.746 kW/hp) x (Electrical usage costs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 14,930 horsepower x 75% load x 8,000 hrs x 2% savings x 0.746 kW/hp x $0.06/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $80,192 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 6 is to determine the in-house labor costs to implement the program. Assume one man-hour per motor per year. Estimated costs for this example will be based upon $25 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 6: In-House Labor Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labor = (1 hour/month/motor) x (# of motors) x (12 months/year) x ($/man-hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 1hour/month/motor x 138 motors x 12 months/year x ($25/man-hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $41,400 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 7 is the purchase price for the MCA and vibration analysis equipment. For the purposes of this article, the same equipment selected for the utility PAT Project will be used. The estimated combined costs for the ALL-TEST IV &lt;em&gt;PRO &lt;/em&gt;2000 MCA instrument and the Pruftechnik vibration analysis equipment is $22,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 8 is the training costs for implementing the system. Assuming equipment training costs of $4,500 per person and maintenance training costs of $6,000 per person, the cost should be approximately $10,500 per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final step is to determine the simple payback for the implementation of the program. In the case of this example, assume a 50% reduction in unplanned downtime for the first year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="74" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose004.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 4: Costs and Savings for Maintenance Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 7: Simple Maintenance Payback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Payback = (Total Costs per Year) / (Total Savings per Year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $73,900 / $569,360&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 0.13 years or 1.6 months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The smaller size of this particular plant would allow for complete implementation of a maintenance program. Larger manufacturing plants will often have thousands of electric motors and may require a breakdown of departments or areas for successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of Vibration Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is used by maintenance professionals as a means to detect mechanical and some limited electrical faults in rotating equipment. By performing regularly scheduled testing, the operating reliability of an electric motor can be determined through trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based upon bearing failure, greasing, belt tension, misalignment or other unbalances, increases in energy losses can occur. These losses show as vibration, noise and heat. Improper belt tension and greasing will increase the friction and windage losses of the motor. This can be calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 8: Bearing Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Watts Loss = (load,lbs x JournalDiameter,inches x rpm x f) / 169&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;f is dependent upon oil used and temperature; &amp;nbsp;0.005 is typical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis for troubleshooting will detect bearing (41% of failures) faults, balance and alignment (12% of failures) faults, primarily. It will also detect rotor faults (10% of failures) and some electrical faults (37% of failures), to some extent. However, electrical and rotor faults tend to fall in frequency ranges that can be related to other equipment, and are directly load related. Vibration analysis requires the electric motor to be operating at a load that is constant during each test that would be trended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of Motor Circuit Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many tools available to perform quality preventive maintenance of individual motors. Of these, motor circuit analysis (MCA) systems hold great promise for identifying motor problems before expensive failure and for improving the general efficiency of motor systems in general. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor circuit analysis allows the analyst to detect winding faults and rotor faults in the electric motor. One power of this type of test method is that it requires the equipment to be de-energized, which allows for initial incoming testing of the electric motors and troubleshooting when equipment fails. Primary energy losses that can be detected include phase unbalance and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R losses, while faults include shorted windings, loose connections, ground faults and rotor faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A resistive fault gives of heat, as a loss. For instance, a 0.5-ohm loose connection on a 100-horsepower electric motor operating at 95 amps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 9: Resistive Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kilo-Watts Loss = (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R)/1000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (95&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x 0.5)/1000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 4.5 kW (demand loss)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 10: Energy Usage Loss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	$/year = kW x hours/year x $/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 4.5 kW x 8000 hours/year x $0.06/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $2,160 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motor phase unbalances (inductance and impedance) affect the current unbalances, cause motors to run hotter and reduce the motor&amp;rsquo;s ability to produce torque. The percentage unbalance of impedance can be evaluated to determine efficiency reduction and additional heating of the electric motor. A general rule is that, for every 10 degrees Celsius increase in operating temperature, the life of the equipment is reduced by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="207" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose005.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Efficiency Reduction Due to Impedance Unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, the paperboard company has a 100-horsepower electric motor, that would normally be 95% efficient, that has a 3.5% impedance unbalance. The efficiency would be reduced by 4 points of efficiency, or to 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 10: Energy Cost Due to Phase Unbalance Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	$/yr savings = hp x 0.746 x %load x $/kWh x hours of operation ((100/Le) (100/He))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 100 hp x 0.756 x .75 load x $0.06/kWh x 8000 hours ((100/91) (100/95))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,240 / year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="216" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose006.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Increase in Temperature Rise Due to Phase Unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impedance unbalance will also cause an increase in operating temperature based upon an increase in I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R losses. In the case of the 100-horsepower electric motor, this means a temperature rise of about 30 degrees Celsius, or a reduction in motor insulation life to 13% of its original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor circuit analysis is also used to evaluate the windings for contamination. &amp;ldquo;Frequent cleaning of a motor&amp;rsquo;s intake (if any) and cooling fins is especially important in dirty environments. &amp;hellip; Tests confirm that even severe duty, generously rated, and oversized motors can quickly fail in such conditions if they become thickly coated or if lightly coated and with their airflow reduced by half. Their insulation life can then fall to 13 to 25% of normal.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; The same phenomenon occurs if the windings become coated in contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The MCA rotor test requires inductance and impedance readings through 360 degrees of rotation of the rotor. The readings are graphed and viewed for symmetry. Rotor test results provide a definitive condition of the rotor and is often performed following identification of a possible rotor fault by vibration, as part of an acceptance program, during repair or when the motor is identified as having torque problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The implementation of an electric motor maintenance program will have a significant impact on a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. Whether the company has a few hundred motors or many thousands, the simple payback from the investment into vibration and MCA is usually termed in months. Payback is impacted from savings from production availability, reduced equipment repair costs and improved energy costs, all with a minimum investment in manpower, training and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application of these two technologies complement one another while also evaluating the progress of the maintenance program and improving upon equipment availability. Vibration analysis evaluates the mechanical condition of equipment while MCA evaluates the electrical condition of equipment. Combined, the analyst has the ability to view the complete condition of the electric motor.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Azima DLI solution targets machine condition monitoring programs </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, a leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on February 8 announced a series of simplified, pre-packaged programs to ensure comprehensive equipment reliability and uptime results. Based on its extensive industry experience, track record of customer success and established WATCHMAN Reliability Services, Azima DLI is able to strip away the complexity of traditional &amp;aacute; la carte maintenance programs and introduce comprehensive, bundled solutions that are tailored to address specific requirements for lean and reliable plant operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to factors including an exodus of talent, streamlined operations and restricted budgets, Azima DLI has found that many plants are challenged to retain the expert analysis resources necessary to keep their condition monitoring programs running smoothly, or simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how to initiate a fresh start for a previously well-run program.

            <title>How to identify, correct a resonance condition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many experts working in the field of vibration analysis will agree that resonance is a very common cause of excessive machine vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resonance is the result of an external force vibrating at the same frequency as the natural frequency of a system. Natural frequency is a characteristic of every machine, structure and even animals. Often, resonance can be confused with the natural frequency or critical frequency. If equipment is operating in a state of resonance, the vibration levels will be amplified significantly, which can cause equipment failure and plant downtime. It is, therefore, important that the running speed of equipment be out of the resonance range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to identify a resonance frequency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many techniques can be used to identify and/or confirm a high vibration level caused by a resonance frequency. It is very important to confirm a resonance phenomenon by at least two different types of tests before trying to correct it. We will look at a few techniques commonly used in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techniques used to confirm a resonance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Impact test:&lt;/strong&gt;One of the most commonly used methods for measuring a system&amp;rsquo;s natural frequency is to strike it with a mass and measure the response. This method is effective because the impact inputs a small amount of force in the equipment over a large frequency range. When performing this technique, it is important to try impacting different locations on the structure since all of a structure&amp;rsquo;s resonant frequencies will always be measurable by impacting at one location and measuring at the same location. Both drive point and transfer point measurements should be taken when attempting to identify machine resonances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This type of test must be performed with the equipment off. This way you can easily identify the natural frequencies of the equipment (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="282" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino001.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Impact Test, Equipment Off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Impact test using an instrumented hammer:&lt;/strong&gt;This test is basically the same as a regular impact test, except that an instrumented hammer is used to excite the system. This hammer, equipped with an accelerometer at one end, is used in tandem with the sensor used to measure the vibration. A two-channel vibration analyzer is needed, in which one channel is connected to the instrumented hammer and the other to the vibration sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using this technique, you can effectively measure the force induced to the system by the instrumented hammer and the response at different frequencies. When the phase shifts by 90 degrees, the frequency at which it occurs is a natural frequency (Figure 2). The advantage in using this method is that it allows you to monitor phase shifts and coherence. With this information, you can create operating deflection shapes to visualize the vibrating body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="450" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino002.jpg" width="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Impact Test with Force Hammer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coast down peak hold:&lt;/strong&gt;Another method used is to monitor the vibration level using a peak hold function, while shutting down the equipment, as performed normally. The vibration level should drop at a steady rate. If the vibration levels start rising at any time while the equipment is being shut down, the speed at which the amplitudes increase is a possible natural frequency (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="324" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino003.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Coast Down Peak Hold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coast down peak phase:&lt;/strong&gt;Like the coast down peak hold, this test is to be conducted while the equipment is being shut down. By installing a photo tack and a piece of reflective tape on the rotating shaft of the equipment, you can monitor the vibration and its phase. This will allow you to see the amplitude and phase shift at all running speeds of the equipment. If there is no resonance excited by the turning speed, the vibration levels should drop at a steady rate. If the vibration peaks at a certain speed and the phase shifts by 180 degrees, this indicates a natural frequency of the equipment or structure. The actual natural frequency is the frequency situated in the middle of the phase shift (90 degrees) (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="321" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino004.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Coast Down Peak Phase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formula for natural frequency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The natural frequency is the frequency of free vibration of a system, in which a system vibrates to dissipate its energy. The natural frequency (&amp;omega;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) of an equipment, expressed in radian per second, is a function of its stiffness (k) and its mass (m), as shown by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="72" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino005.gif" width="100" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If any of these two parameters are altered, the natural frequency will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you modify a natural frequency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we want to modify the natural frequency of a body, we have to either change the stiffness or the mass. Increasing the mass or lowering the stiffness will lower the natural frequency while reducing mass or increasing stiffness will increase natural frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we operate critical equipment if we can&amp;rsquo;t change the natural frequency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we cannot change the stiffness or the mass of the equipment, two possible choices are offered to us. One easy solution is to change the operating speed of the equipment by 20 to 30 percent, but this is not usually an option. Another solution is to install a dynamic absorber on the equipment to significantly reduce the vibration levels of the equipment. The dynamic absorber is a spring-mass system that is installed in series with the resonant system to create an out-of-phase exciting force to effectively counteract the initial exciting force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resonance is probably one of the five common causes of excessive machine vibration. Identifying a resonance frequency effectively can be challenging. We need to positively identify the natural frequency by performing at least two different tests such as impact test, coast down peak hold, coast down peak phase or impact test using a force hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the resonance is confirmed, either change the mass or the stiffness of the equipment to change its natural frequency. If it cannot be accomplished try to change the operating speed of the equipment. If that fails, consider installing a dynamic absorber to counteract the initial exciting force.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to manage a multi-technology condition monitoring program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Managing a multi-technology condition monitoring program at a large mining operation was a challenging task, especially when there has been a cultural shift required to integrate the ideas of condition monitoring into an already complex maintenance strategy. One of the major challenges included shifting the focus of an experienced maintenance crew from a run-to-failure mentality to a proactive mentality. Another major challenge was folding the new work practices into the current work flow model, one which didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of emphasis on backlogged maintenance items. Finally, coaching the supervision and management about why this is the right move proved to be one of the more difficult tasks of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now less than a year later, dramatic results are being realized. As the condition monitoring statistics trend in the right direction, maintenance costs are shifting sharply as well. Overtime has dropped, and unplanned downtime has decreased significantly. The best part is the workforce is becoming more and more focused on fixing problems rather than fixing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This paper will share some of the stories and many of the measures that made this shift possible. In addition, some of the software tools and work flow models that helped drive the measures and decision making processes will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine is a large, open-pit mining operation located 25 miles south of Lakeland, Fla. Four Corners is one of six mines belonging to The Mosaic Corporation, the world&amp;rsquo;s 13th-largest producer of phosphate fertilizer. The Four Corners Mine produces approximately 6.5 million tons of phosphate rock annually. The mine has three distinct areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

		Dragline Operations: Electric draglines are used for mineral extraction. There are six draglines averaging 50 cubic yards each.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field Pumping System: 82 large 2,000-horsepower pumps are used to move the unprocessed phosphate rock (matrix) from the draglines to the float plant. This makes for nearly 70 miles of 20-inch and 22-inch pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Float Plant: The float plant includes numerous conveyors, vibrating screens, pumps and log washers that are all used to clean the phosphate rock and separate the debris and unwanted material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told there are 775 pieces of rotating equipment on the entire facility. There are 270 employees at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four Corners Mine, with 110 of them in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine embarked on the implementation of a multi-technology condition monitoring program in March 2005 and has seen some very dramatic changes take place since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand the Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were and still remain several large challenges to getting the process completely ironed out. Like any process that involves more than one person, the relationships between the people play a vital role in continued success. Each of the individuals has to develop a level of trust in the others and as a group they have to develop a unified sense of purpose. Finding and retaining qualified personnel is another large challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring personnel who want to work in a mining environment and have any experience at all are very difficult to come by. As everyone begins to work together on a daily basis attitudes and personalities start to play major roles in the group&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping all these technical people working and working together can prove to be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key challenges is developing an understanding of the process between the maintenance group and condition monitoring group. The maintenance people have to understand the condition monitoring process, and the condition monitoring people have to understand the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without each fully grasping the other&amp;rsquo;s process and where they themselves fit into the other process, any kind of forward momentum will be difficult to initiate. Finally, internal group politics can play a large role in extinguishing improvements in the overall process. If there are individuals who tend to not give credit where credit is due, hard feelings can develop. On the other hand, if the leaders of the change process are quick to hand out pats on the back and do it often, then everyone feels they are appreciated and tend to work even harder to advance the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desire to Succeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key role in the success of any process is a strong desire to succeed. That desire is easily seen at the Four Corners Mine. The maintenance manager is the catalyst that keeps the program rolling on a daily basis. The manager&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward condition monitoring as a part of the overall maintenance strategy is what keeps the rest of the maintenance department focused. Above the maintenance manager, in the corporate office, the desire for the program to succeed is seen as well. The benefits of the condition monitoring program have been folded into the overall financial strategy of the mining operations at the Mosaic operations of central Florida. The condition monitoring program is expected to produce results in the safety, costs and availability areas of the overall plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety measures have been affected by means of reduced overtime and call-out work. When crafts personnel are not called out as much at night to work on equipment that has failed during a scheduled production shift, the likelihood for injury has been reduced. When the precise nature of a problem has been identified prior to work commencing and the craftsmen don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend unnecessary time and effort looking for the problem, the likelihood for injury has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being able to identify problems and get them corrected long before additional damage happens to other components of a machine reduces the overall cost of the repair. All of these add up to reduced unplanned downtime which is increased machinery availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Technology vs. Asset Ranking Graph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multi-technology Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine decided early to employ as many condition monitoring technologies as they could to provide the highest likelihood of identifying the actual failure modes of the assets. Vibration analysis, contact ultrasonic emissions, oil analysis and mechanical infrared thermography were chosen to identify rotating machinery defects. Motor circuit analysis and electrical infrared thermography were chosen to identify the failure modes of the electric motors and the associated switchgear. See Figure 1 for the percentage of coverage by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Technology Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mosaic Company also decided early on that an investment in the best technology available would help ensure the best results. CSI 2130s were chosen as the vibration analysis platform. Mikron infrared cameras were chosen for the thermography effort. The UE Systems 10,000 was selected for contact and airborne ultrasonic analysis. And, the venerable PdMA MCE/Emax was selected as the motor circuit analyzer of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="342" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon02.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Integrated Condition Status Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web-based Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Web-based reporting platform is used to communicate the results of all condition monitoring technologies to Mosaic personnel. A Web-based reporting tool was selected for numerous reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It requires no software to be installed on customer&amp;rsquo;s computers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It can be accessed from any computer with access to the World Wide Web.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is not limited to any particular hardware or software platform for the different technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is easily expandable as other technologies are added or removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mosaic wants all levels of supervision to be involved in the identification and elimination of machinery faults. Consequently everyone has access to the software. Figure 2 shows an example of a report available in the software that summarizes all of the problems identified in a given area of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated Work Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A fully integrated work flow model would be defined as one where both the Mosaic personnel and the Allied Reliability personnel had equal ownership in getting the work identified and accomplished. Figure 3 shows the work flow model, which is color-coded to quickly identify who is responsible for which part of the process. It was decided that this integrated workflow would provide the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get Mosaic and Allied interacting on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure Mosaic personnel took ownership of certain portions of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technician can make clear recommendations not just alert the customer to the technical aspects of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interaction at the lowest level creates a learning process for both the technician and the craftsmen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The &amp;ldquo;Post Check&amp;rdquo; is the feedback loop for the maintenance repair process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Relationship between the technician, supervisor and mechanic &amp;hellip; crucial for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="307" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon03.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Four Corners &amp;ndash; Condition Monitoring Work Flow Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was agreed that workforce education was an important foundational element that would keep the process going. Four Corners continues to make a significant effort to educate all maintenance employees about P-F intervals (see Figure 4). In addition, technology familiarization was also a major topic. Making all of the front-line supervisors and craftsmen aware of the different condition monitoring technologies and how they worked was seen as a key component of gaining acceptance. The reliability engineers conduct monthly &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions where sandwiches are brought in and key program elements and/or technology demonstrations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="256" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon04.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. P-F Interval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a dedicated focus, it is very easy to lose sight of the goal. To ensure this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, Four Corners dedicated a good portion of the reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s time to overseeing the process. Their goal is to maintain maintenance engagement and awareness while at the same time measuring and benchmarking the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s results and success as well as Allied Reliability&amp;rsquo;s. Successes are purposely celebrated at weekly meetings and misses are clearly identified and root causes eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon05.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. MTBF &amp;ndash; Motor Failures (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The entire process must be inundated with an attitude of constant improvement, and at Four Corners, it is. The maintenance manager is always pushing for more and better results. The reliability engineers are always pushing for more detailed explanations of problems and more focus on eliminating root causes. In an effort to help maintain this focus, Allied Reliability provides Four Corners with a monthly report on numerous measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Red, Yellow and Green Condition Entries, both overall and by technology&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Condition Entries Implemented&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Work Orders Generated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Route Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average Time to Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-world Measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are three graphs representing the effect that Four Corners&amp;rsquo; attitude toward constant improvement and condition monitoring has had since March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New NIST method reveals all you need to know about waveforms</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has unveiled a method for calibrating entire waveforms â graphical shapes showing how electrical signals vary over time â rather than just parts of waveforms as is current practice. The new method improves accuracy in calibrations of oscilloscopes, common test instruments that measure voltage in communications and electronics devices, and potentially could boost performance and save money in other fields ranging from medical testing to structural analysis to remote sensing.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;A waveform can take many different shapes, from staircase steps to irregular curves. A waveform typically is described by a single number â some key parameter of interest in a particular application. For example, engineers have described waveforms using terms such as pulse duration, or transition time between the levels representing â0â and â1â (the binary code used in digital electronics). But waveforms can be diverse and complex, especially in advanced high-speed devices, and a traditional analysis may not distinguish between similar shapes that differ in subtle ways. The result can be signal mistakes (a 1 mistaken for a 0, for instance) or misidentification of defects.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;NISTâs new calibration method* defines waveforms completely, providing both signal reading and measurement uncertainty at regular intervals along the entire wave, and for the first time makes waveform calibrations traceable to fundamental physics. The mathematics-intensive method is laborious and currently is performed only at NIST (which has more than 750 oscilloscopes), but the developers plan to write a software program that will automate the technique and make it transferable to other users.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The new method offers NIST calibration customers, including major manufacturers and the military, more comprehensive characterization of a greater variety of waveforms, and helps to meet current and future demands for measurements at ever-higher frequencies, data rates, and bandwidths. The impact could be far reaching. The global market for oscilloscopes is $1.2 billion. Anecdotal data suggest that for one product alone, Ethernet optical fiber transceivers, industry could save tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars through manufacturing innovations (such as the new NIST method) that reduce component reject rates and/or boost yields. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Of particular interest to scientists and engineers, the NIST calibration method incorporates new techniques for quantifying errors in waveform measurements. This allows, for the first time, accurate transfer of measurement uncertainties between the time domain (results arranged by time) and the frequency domain (the same data arranged by frequency). Researchers in many fields have long used a technique called âFourier transform,â which reveals patterns in a sequence of numbers, to transfer data from the time domain to the frequency domain. âThe new NIST method is, in effect, a Fourier transform for uncertainty,â says NIST physicist Paul Hale.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Although the new method was developed for common lab test instruments, it also may have applications in measuring other types of waveforms, such as those generated in electrocardiograms for medical testing, ultrasound diagnostics of structural defects and failures, speech recognition, seismology and other remote sensing activities.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

It pertains to evaluation of vibration when the vibration measurements are made on non-rotating parts (bearing housing vibration). The general evaluation criteria are included for acceptance tests in field environments or at the manufacturerâs test facility, as appropriate and as defined in the standard.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Vibration program succeeds when you keep it simple</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Many vibration programs fail because they become too complicated. Too much data can sometimes become more confusing than too little data. Many potential machinery problems can be eliminated with the analysis if you keep in mind several simple concepts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Vibration units such as acceleration are more sensitive to high frequencies than low frequencies. 
&lt;LI&gt;Vibration units such as displacement are more sensitive to low frequencies that high. 
&lt;LI&gt;Velocity units are evenly sensitive, on average, between 60 CPM to 60,000 CPM. 
&lt;LI&gt;High-frequency vibration does not travel far and degrades rapidly through metal seams. 
&lt;LI&gt;In general, the closer your measurement is to the source of the vibration, the higher the amplitude will be. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These differences can be used to zero in on machine faults.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, take a generic 100-horsepower motor. If an outboard rolling element bearing begins to fail because of a lack of lubrication, the first indicator is high-frequency ringing from the bearing. This is characterized by a large increase in acceleration amplitude and small to no increase in velocity or displacement. Now you have identified that there is a high-frequency problem and not a low-frequency mechanical problem. You can eliminate low-frequency sources such as looseness, balance or misalignment. What is the most likely source of high-frequency vibration on the back end of a motor? Itâs probably a bearing or shaft or rotor rub.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now, you can apply a simple test. Grease the bearing and see if the acceleration returns to normal. If it does, you have nailed the problem without knowing the bearing frequencies or even taking a spectrum. Come back the next day and see if the acceleration is back up. If it is, you either have a lubrication problem with contamination or a loss of grease, a damaged bearing or both.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While not perfect, understanding the behavior of vibration units combined with a mechanical understanding of machinery can help you quickly identify machinery problems. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The article is courtesy of Ludeca Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of tools and systems for laser shaft alignment; monitoring of positional change in running machinery (thermal growth); bore and turbine diaphragm alignment; flatness and straightness measuring and vertical plumbness measuring.

            <title>Aeroderivative gas turbine and gearbox/genset vibration</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;Mechanical Solutions Inc. was called on behalf of a customer who had observed a large increase in the vibration levels of an LM500 gas turbine generator set that was being used to supply power to a large pharmaceutical facility. The increase in the vibration levels was serious enough to warrant shutdown.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This power facility was used to meet much of the electrical power needs of the entire complex. Any loss of generating capacity translated directly into increased electrical operating costs because of the need to buy power from the grid at a time of the year when such purchases were particularly expensive. The plant wished to continue operation for another three months, when a planned shutdown was to occur.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=236 alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_article-uploads_clip_image002.gif" width=345&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The OEM had not been able to find the reason for the difficulty. Therefore, MSI was called in to help diagnose and fix the excessive vibration. The customer had noticed that the large increase in the overall vibration was particularly troublesome in between the gas turbine and the generator. They suspected that the problem was a torsional natural frequency of the gearbox. MSI performed testing using generator shaft strain gauges and sophisticated radio telemetry. Because of MSIâs experience conducting such tests, the generator was shut down for only one hour in order to install the telemetry system.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The testing was to focus on torsional oscillation but showed that the torsion did not cause the high gear box vibration. MSI continued testing and was able to quantify the vibration levels with increasing load.&amp;nbsp; Based on the shape of the vibration spectrum, the strength of the vibration appeared to be associated with a natural frequency resonance. However, impulse testing on exposed components detected no strong natural frequencies near 1X or 2x gear mesh. It also was noted that the vibration increase was sensitive to load level. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;In light of this, the sudden increase in vibration suggested a possible shaft or casing crack which opens up under increasing load. This crack could open up further as the load transmitted through the gearbox was increased. Stationary âbumpâ tests did not indicate that this crack was present, but vibration measurements at many locations and at various loads made it clearly apparent.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;In order to be completely certain that this was the most likely cause, MSI also tested the electrical generator to confirm that the problem was not generator or electrical system based. This testing revealed nothing unusual in the phase-to-phase characteristics of the system, and left a crack as the most likely cause of the problem.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;On the recommendation of MSI, die penetrant testing of the gearbox was conducted. The die penetrant testing revealed that a crack had formed on the foot of the gearbox casing. The crack was welded shut and, subsequently, the vibration of the gearbox was reduced to the earlier acceptable levels. This work allowed the end-user to continue power generation during a critical portion of production.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;In addition to knowledge of the LM500, the staff of Mechanical Solutions Inc. has background and experience in the analysis and testing of aeroderivative gas turbines, such as the popular FT-4, FT-8, LM2500, LM6000 PC, and Frame 7FA units. One of MSIâs principals was one of the design analysis team members for the original ground-based and marine-based conversions of the FT-4. Generally, problems with these units are installation or system related. MSIâs ability to separate and evaluate rotordynamic, casing and support structure effects allows such problems as well as any warranty issues to be quickly identified, such that responsibilities can be determined, and appropriate fixes can be developed and implemented.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Vibration analyzer ensures bearing reliability in gearbox refurbishing</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Fifty years of ongoing development has given SKF a bearing vibration analyzer that can probe deep into rotating bearings while they are under load. Initially used as a production line tester, itâs now proving invaluable during the maintenance and refurbishment of gearboxes and other critical units in demanding applications such as aerospace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF vibration testing equipment is released by Rolls-Royce for noise testing of bearings during gearbox servicing. Release became necessary when Rolls-Royce Deutschland decided to transfer service work on gearboxes for secondary power systems to the sub-contractor Vector Aerospace in Almondbank, Scotland. Overhaul of these gearboxes requires detailed inspection of more than 3,000 components, some of which require testing with special equipment. This includes the various types of rolling bearings used in the gearbox that require stringent noise and vibration testing and measurement of the radial and axial clearances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vector Aerospace selected SKF as the best suitable supplier of test equipment for the bearing tests, but before putting the equipment to use, it was necessary to run a release process with Rolls-Royce Deutschland. A detailed test and acceptance program was developed by Rolls-Royce Deutschland using reference and series bearings of different manufacturers to confirm the usability of the noise-test equipment after its installation at Vector Aerospace site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development of SKF vibration testing equipment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good first step toward solving any problem is to get the facts. Thatâs exactly what a group of senior engineers at SKF did in the early 1950s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF already had a proven reputation as a leading rolling bearings manufacturer. Its bearings were used successfully in countless applications all around the world. They were made from quality materials, using the most up-to-date production processes and carefully checked before packaging. So, what was the problem?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was said that collectively the group members knew everything there was to know about bearing materials, bearing design, bearing manufacturing and bearing applications. But still, the SKF engineers had a problem. They were concerned about the causes of failure that bearings from all manufacturers were exhibiting. Minute exterior examination of bearing components and bearing assemblies could only take them so far. They wanted more facts. They wanted to probe deep inside a bearing while it was rotating and while it was under loads similar to those it would experience in service.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Intuitively, they knew that vibrations caused by the rotating and flexible parts in a bearing caused noise and could be a source of wear and bearing damage. But they also felt that understanding the vibrations better could tell them even more â perhaps even tell them what caused the vibration in the first place and how to design and manufacture in order to reduce the vibrations and the corresponding wear. And so, SKF set off on a path to develop an understanding of vibration phenomena in bearings as well as a method of measuring vibrations and connecting this back to distinct causes, as specific as rolling element-induced vibration or damaged ring-induced vibration, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the mid-1950s, the group had successfully created its first vibration testing equipment for analyzing structure-borne noise and vibration in bearings. They went on to develop equipment that would reveal problems hidden within a bearing such as dirt particles, cage noise or form deviations in a component. Their search had revealed the factors that could lead to bearing failure and customer dissatisfaction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Early milestone&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Early versions of the equipment were introduced into production line testing, but the group continued to probe further until, in 1965, one member of the group, E. Yhland, reached a milestone in the understanding of the quasi-static problem of bearing vibration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His work became a contribution to establishing national standards such as AFBMA 13-1987 and DIN 5426 (draft). These standards define and specify the physical quantities to be measured and the test conditions to be applied. The equipment became of extreme importance for high-quality bearing production.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today, SKF equipment such as the MVH vibration tester is used to analyze precisely the structure-borne noise and vibration of deep-groove ball bearings, angular contact ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical roller bearings. The MVH is also used as the SKF reference equipment for these measurements.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Operation of the MVH 90C/200C vibration tester is semi-automatic, so when a bearing is to be tested, the only things to be done by hand are: the loading of the bearing on the test spindle; the pressing of the two-handed start; and removal of the bearing after the test.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The extremely precise sliding bearing spindle drives the inner ring of the bearing at a constant set speed while loading is provided by an adjustable, pneumatic axial loading unit. When the automatic test cycle begins, the axial loading unit applies an axial load to the outer ring and moves the bearing against the testing spindle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A pickup is applied to the stationary outer ring of the bearing and any bearing noise is measured, analyzed and displayed. After a predetermined time, the axial loading unit returns to its rest position and the machine is ready for the next test cycle. Resetting for another type of bearing can be done quickly and simply.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tip of the pickup rests against the outer ring and converts the radial vibration of the bearing into an electrical signal that is proportional to the velocity of the pickup tip. When the signal is amplified and analyzed, the vibration level is measured in three frequency bands. The result identifies one or more of a possible number of defect types as well as detecting dirt particles, cage noise and form deviations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reducing costs and ensuring reliability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The great success of vibration measuring equipment in bearing refurbishment for the aerospace industry has lead to increasing interest from other areas of industry. There is also increasing awareness of the savings to be made from the reuse of bearings that have been tested and meet quality and reliability standards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other examples of the vibration testerâs versatility are its use in manufacturing companies where the equipment can be used to inspect incoming components, and its use in research departments to support R&amp;amp;D activities or act as a test rig for gears, motors or steering units, etc. The equipment is equally useful for grease noise testing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continued development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although the bearing vibration analyzer has come a long way since the 1950s, its development continues at SKF, where the search is on for even more accurate measurements and analysis. At the present time, research is focusing on three interesting areas: the application of different sensor technologies; the use of a detailed noise map; and the introduction of an expert system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information on SKF vibration analyzers, visit &lt;A href="http://www.skf.com"&gt;www.skf.com&lt;/A&gt; . &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/GVQB1yAScjY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why are you performing vibe analysis?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Vibration analysis is the cornerstone of any condition monitoring program. The venerable Art Crawford (founder of IRD) said, "No single measurement can provide as much information about a machine as the vibration signature." Gross defects such as severe shaft misalignment to subtle conditions such as differences in grease types can be detected with vibration analysis. As powerful as this technology is, it's often the most misapplied of the condition monitoring tools. This article will focus on the proper philosophy behind the technology's use inside an overall condition monitoring program. While many maintenance and reliability initiatives incorporate vibration analysis, few people have a sound philosophical base for how it is to be utilized. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The proper use of a quality vibration analysis program can provide focus to the crafts personnel. The analysis of the vibration signature, when performed in a timely manner, pinpoints the precise nature and location of the problem. This empowers the planning and scheduling process by allowing the crafts to go straight to the heart of the problem and not waste time on troubleshooting. Vibration analysis performed too late in the propagation of a defect won't help the crafts as much. Waiting too late actually allows the defect to propagate beyond the physical part it initiated in and create even more work for technicians. An example is that, detected early enough, the shaft misalignment can be corrected before the bearing defect has even begun. Wait too long and not only are the shafts misaligned, but the bearings are defective and the bearing housings are damaged to the point that the bearings are loose in the housings. At this point, it will be difficult to get a technician to extol the benefits of vibration analysis, as it has not resulted in any more efficient work or easier troubleshooting. The correct use of vibration analysis enables the crafts to focus their resources on the issues that make the greatest difference. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another powerful benefit of vibration analysis is that it buys the planning and scheduling effort a substantial amount of time to actually work at a normal pace. While any job can be expedited and hurried, jobs that don't require expediting are cheaper and easier by virtue of the fact that additional fees aren't paid for expediting parts, and less effort is expended in the reallocation of labor and other resources. These activities lead to higher costs and higher stress levels within the planning effort. Having parts drop-shipped and air-freighted always cost more money. Having maintenance work teams working on machinery that hasn't already failed makes their jobs much easier. Having a planning group and a crafts group able to take their time and not be rushed creates a less stressful environment and, thus, increases the conditional probability of correct execution of both the job plan and the job itself. Vibration analysis identifies defects early enough to allow the planning and scheduling process the maximum amount of time to effectively and efficiently deal with the situation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The single-largest error people make is to use vibration analysis to simply find yet another bearing fault, fix the fault and then celebrate the fact that a bearing defect was detected and corrected. This represents an incomplete understanding of the purpose of condition monitoring. This attitude is referred to as "optimizing your run-to-failure maintenance strategy". By being satisfied with finding the defect and merely correcting it, you haven't improved your processes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The only way lasting improvement can be made is to identify the latent root of the systemic problems that are creating these defects. Vibration analysis is a powerful tool for identifying the physical cause of the defect or the physical effect of the condition. This information empowers the root cause analysis effort. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration analysis, when used incorrectly, does nothing more than optimize an organization's run-to-failure maintenance strategy. At this point, it is nothing more than a cost-added activity and not a value-added activity. Using vibration analysis in this manner drives up costs, and direct benefits are difficult to quantify. However, used correctly, it provides some distinct benefits to maintenance and reliability efforts. It enables the crafts to focus their resources on the issues that make the most difference. It empowers the planning and scheduling process to be able to achieve more in a shorter period of time and with less effort. And, it enables an RCA process that will allow for a much quicker and thorough identification and elimination of the root cause of the defect. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now is the time to ask yourself, why are you performing vibration analysis?

            <title>Lessons learned for pneumatic vibration equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Pneumatic vibration equipment is an engineered solution that must be installed and operated properly (according to the manufacturerâs instructions) in order to obtain maximum benefits. To that end, VIBCO shares some âlessons learnedâ regarding the installation and operation of pneumatic vibration equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Its top five pneumatic vibration equipment lessons learned include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Correct installation and mounting is critical to performance. 
&lt;LI&gt;The condition, size and configuration of your air line is important. 
&lt;LI&gt;Correct air pressure (PSI) and air flow (CFM) are essential. 
&lt;LI&gt;Periodic checks for loose mounting fixtures can extend the life of your pneumatic vibration equipment. 
&lt;LI&gt;If your unit requires lubrication (piston and ball style), make sure that your lubricator is functioning correctly and is no more than 5 feet away from the unit. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The best way to ensure that you receive the maximum benefits and life from pneumatic vibration equipment is to follow the manufacturerâs installation and operation instructions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;(&lt;A href="http://www.vibco.com/serviceandinstallation/serviceandinstallation.htm"&gt;VIBCO instruction manuals are online for your convenience.&lt;/A&gt;) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. Correct installation and mounting is critical to performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make sure to follow all of the mounting and installation steps exactly as they are provided in the manual. One of the ways you can ensure a good mount is to select the correct mounting plate and channel for your bin. The following charts are good ârule of thumbâ guides:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=172 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pneumatic_clip_image001.jpg" width=500&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. The condition, size and configuration of your air line is important. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Kinks, holes and leaks in your air line can easily degrade the performance of your pneumatic vibration equipment, causing it to run and then stop unexpectedly. Pneumatic equipment performance can also be degraded if your air line is split between units (âTâ junction) or used to run multiple pneumatic units. Best practice is to run separate, correctly sized lines for each unit in operation, and to perform periodic checks for kinks, leaks and holes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Correct air pressure (PSI) and air flow (CFM) are essential. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make sure that you are providing your pneumatic unit(s) with correct PSI and CFM. Pneumatic units should have the recommended PSI and CFM indicated on the housing or on the shipping box. A general rule of thumb is that PSI should be 40 to 80, and you should consult your manual for proper CFM. Insufficient or too high of air pressure flow can cause unit failures. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;(&lt;A href="http://www.gates.com/industrial/pressure/airflow.cfm?location_id=3043"&gt;Click here for a handy Air Flow Pressure calculator.&lt;/A&gt;) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;4. Periodic checks for loose mounting fixtures can extend the life of your pneumatic vibration equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most pneumatic vibration equipment is virtually maintenance-free. You can increase the life of your equipment by performing periodic checks of the mounting assembly and hardware. Check to ensure that all mounting bolts are tight and hardware is securely welded to the bin. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5. If your unit requires lubrication (piston and ball style), make sure that your lubricator is functioning correctly and is no more than 5 feet away from the vibration unit. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Too much distance between the lubricator and vibration equipment can cause too little or no lubrication to reach the unit. Your lubricator should be no more than 5 feet away from the unit. For best results, you should use using air tool oil. You may also use SAE 10 or lighter machine tool oil, Marvel Mystery oil or automatic transmission oil. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;1. The electric vibration equipment is mounted directly to the bin or hopper rather than to a mounting plate and mounting channel.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Mounting directly to the bin or hopper can cause the bin or hopper to crack, can cause damage to the vibration equipment, and can cause a high amperage draw. It is critical for vibration equipment to be mounted to a plate and channel. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;2. The electric vibration equipment is mounted to just a plate or just a channel.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;It is extremely important to mount vibration equipment in the manner recommended by the manufacturer. Vibration, while an effective material flow aid, can be a destructive force if it is not isolated properly. Using a mounting plate alone, or a channel alone, may not be sufficient to secure and isolate the vibration force exerted by the equipment. For best results, use a channel iron and mounting plate together.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;3. The electric vibration equipment has been mounted in an incorrect position.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Electric units should be mounted perpendicular to the channel iron, and the mounting plate should be checked for warping and shimmed, if necessary, to achieve a tight seal. Any looseness or "give" will prevent the vibration force from being properly isolated. A sufficient length of channel should be used to distribute the force throughout the bin or hopper.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;4. The welding, shimming and/or bolting of the vibration mount is problematic.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Mounting channel should be stitch-welded to the hopper or bin, with no welds on the corners of the channel. Welding on the corners of the channel can lead to bin damage and unit failure. All bolts should be tightened down securely to prevent slippage and all shims should be positioned to keep the mounting plate flat.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Your vibration mount is critical to maximizing the benefits of your equipment.

            <title>Finding, fixing problems in coal pulverizer exhauster bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Reliability in Action department features case studies submitted by our readers. To have your case study considered for inclusion in an upcoming issue, e-mail it to parnold@noria.com or mail it to Reliable Plant, P.O. Box 87, Fort Atkinson, WI 53538. If we publish your case study, we'll send you an official Reliable Plant T-shirt. This issue's case study was written by Brian Miska, technical analyst at Consumers Energy's J.C. Weadock plant in Hampton Township, Mich.:&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action_Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Reli_Action_Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1 displays readings before the exhauster bearing housing replacement. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration analysis is conducted monthly on four Combustion Engineering Raymond Bowl coal pulverizers (Model 673), which supply fuel to a 1.028 million-pounds-per-hour boiler, which supplies steam to a turbine and 165-megawatt generator. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action_Figure2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Reli_Action_Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2 is after the exhauster bearing housing replacement. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During routine vibration data collection on the Unit 8, No. 4 pulverizer exhauster, high vibration was discovered on the outboard end of the bearing housing, which supports a 6-foot-diameter overhung fan. The overall vibration level in the spectrum was .38 inches per second (IPS) velocity in the vertical and horizontal direction. Normal bearing vibration should be less than .10 IPS velocity. Vibration data collection and monitoring was conducted over several days and it was found that the vibration level would change from one startup to the next. Vibration analysis determined the vibration was caused by mechanical looseness, which allowed the bearing to spin in the housing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action_Figure3.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Reli_Action_Figure3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;The bearing in question is located in the center of this picture, to the right of the exhauster wheel. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A maintenance work order was written to replace the exhauster bearing housing during the next pulverizer outage. After the replacement of the bearing housing, the pulverizer was returned to service and the vibration level was reduced to .08 inches per second. Inspection of the bearing housing found evidence of the bearing spinning in the housing, which was caused by excessive clearance between the bearing and the bearing housing sleeve. The plant maintenance department determined that the machine shop, which installed the new sleeve for the bearing housing, used the incorrect bearing outer race measurement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An inspection of our spare exhauster bearing housings found two additional bearing housings with the incorrect bearing sleeve size. The identified bearing housings were returned for the proper repair, and all newly rebuilt bearing housings will be measured to ensure dimensional accuracy upon return from the local machine shop. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Identifying and correcting the exhauster bearing problem during a scheduled equipment outage prevented a production loss of 30 megawatt hours, with a potential cost of $58,000. Damage to the pulverizer gearbox also could have occurred, which would have resulted in extra downtime and repair costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/vbmu2_KkgQQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Missouri prof using vibration to identify stress in parts</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In the basement of the engineering building on the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceType w:st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt; of &lt;st1:PlaceName w:st="on"&gt;Missouri-Columbia&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; campus, P. Frank Pai is trying to find a quick, convenient and inexpensive method of detecting cracks in airplane parts.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Pai is trying to develop a portable system that can test a part while it's on the aircraft. He has come up with a computer program that analyzes data collected from parts that are vibrated and simultaneously scanned with a laser beam.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Case study: Pump vibration at an electrical utility</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;A Reliable Plant reader, a maintenance planner at a major &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 /&gt;&lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;U.S.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt; utility, recently submitted this case study. It offers invaluable information to all of you who work on pumps.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;During monthly vibration data collection rounds, a power stationâs 500-horsepower vertical turbine circulating water pump experienced a large increase in vibration compared to the previous month readings.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;The running speed vibration trend showed the November 2004 reading went from a normal 0.257 inches/second velocity to 0.468 inches/second in February 2005, and then increased again to 0.637 inches/second in March. Analyst review of the data found the largest response at the top of the motor, which is normal for most vertical pumps as they tend to pivot at the pump discharge head mounting to the floor. Resonance is common with this design of pump, however, the natural frequency of this pump/motor system was found to be well above the 500 rpm operating speed of the pump through the use of a simple bump test. The waveform pattern showing a predominant 1x (running speed) cycle supported an imbalance/wear condition.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;Knowing this, shaft displacement readings were taken in an effort to judge the severity of the problem. After using a strobe light on the exposed pump shaft below the coupling to ensure no keyway or protrusion would interfere, a shaft stick (fish tail) with the vibration sensor mounted on it was safely held against the shaft. In the past, the shaft displacement had generally been around three to five mils. Now the vibration exceeded 16 mils, all at running speed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;A spring outage was previously planned in three weeks for this unit. Due to the rapid change in vibration and the severity, recommendations were made to pull the pump during this outage. The pump was monitored on a bi-weekly basis until the outage to ensure it would not catastrophically fail.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;Preparations were made for impeller replacement as this was likely the source of the high running speed vibration due to imbalance, possibly from a broken vane due to foreign object damage or excessive wear ring clearances. This type of damage was suspected because this pump is in a pit fed by a nearby river and has a history of damage due to debris. River water is screened into the intake house, however, during the spring, high river levels tend to bypass debris and repetitive failures of the screen wash system have allowed debris past the screens which travels to the pit at the plant.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;However, plant management still needed convincing that this was the problem, so prior to the outage, divers were brought in to inspect the circulating water pit for debris and to look at the pump impeller. The pit was surprisingly clean, but the diver found the pump impeller tips damaged and an obvious offset to the fit of the impeller to the bowl. This likely meant that the impeller wear ring was worn excessively and/or the lower shaft was bent.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;Armed with this information, the pump was then scheduled for repair during the outage. Upon inspection, the impeller wear ring was found worn, blade/vane tips were damaged/bent and the shaft was bent. Parts were available for repair, but additional time was required to order a new shaft. The condenser was found with excessive debris, so the hypothesis is that the pump had passed large debris that likely bent the shaft. Repairs were completed within the timeframe of the scheduled outage and the pump was successfully returned to service.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;A href="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_casestudy-chart.gif"&gt;&lt;IMG alt="click to see full size image" hspace=0 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_casestudy-chart-thumb.gif" align=baseline border=1&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"&gt;After the outage, an inspection of the remotely located river water intake house found damaged intake screens and inefficient screen washing. In an effort to prevent any future failures to the circulating water pumps, repairs were made to the screen and a new screen wash pump with a stand-by unit were installed. A new control system was added to sense differential pressure on the screen improving the overall efficiency of this system. Regular preventive maintenance inspections of the intake house system were developed and scheduled in the computerized maintenance management system to ensure this often neglected system is kept in good condition. To date, less debris has been found in the condenser water boxes and the circulating water pumps have been running fine, but we are still fighting the high water levels during the spring rains.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/vibration_analysis/~4/gopxyRTAFtI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Detect soft foot with vibration analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Soft foot poses a challenge for plant operations and maintenance personnel. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The common term for machine frame distortion, soft foot is caused when one or more feet of a machine are shorter, longer or angled some way different than the rest of the feet. This non-uniformity causes stress on the machinery when the foot is forced into place by tightening the hold-down bolt. Missing shims under a foot, a bent foot, or a deteriorating base plate or foundation can cause this condition. In addition, pipe stress can cause machine frame distortion and, therefore, also is considered a soft foot condition. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When soft foot is present, the intended machine design and clearances are compromised. It can cause high vibration levels because the machinery is unduly exposed to excessive wear with each shaft revolution. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Deflection and Damage &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Often, soft foot is not seen as a critical problem, but letâs investigate the damage it can cause. When machine frame distortion exists, the bearing housings are misaligned with respect to one another. This offset, as well as angular misalignment, creates a load on the rotating shaft that results in shaft deflection. When the shaft turns, this results in vibration since the shaft must deflect by double the amount of the deflection at rest, at twice the speed of rotation. For example, at 1,800 revolutions per minute (RPM) running speed, a soft foot distortion provokes 5.184 million deflection cycles every 24 hours (Figure 1). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=218 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_preload-on-bearings.jpg" width=275&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Figure 1. An example of preload on the bearings.&lt;BR&gt;At 1,800 RPM, which equals 60 stress-reversal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cycles every second (reverses twice in each full &lt;BR&gt;rotation), this is nearly 5.2 million back-and-forth &lt;BR&gt;deflection cycles every 24 hours.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is, of course, the bearings that directly transmit the forces required to do this to the shafts. Therefore, soft foot greatly increases the load on the bearings, results in increased power consumption and provokes metal fatigue of the shaft over time. Bearings and seals suffer premature wear and are prone to premature failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration data can reveal signs of many machinery health problems, among them soft foot. How do you determine if soft foot is the culprit? A machine is determined to have a soft foot if the calculated value of movement of a machine foot when tightened or loosened is at least 0.002 to 0.003 inches while the remaining feet are bolted tight. This condition often (but not always) causes an increase in overall machine vibration. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
  
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;P&gt;If the overall vibration level is too high, the next step is to determine why. A common practice is to take a spectrum on the bearing housing of the equipment. If safety is not compromised, take measurements while the machinery is operating. Take a spectrum in live mode. This is a feature of some data collectors that allows the user to continuously view the spectrum while the machinery is running. This is handy if you are trying to view a transient event. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To help determine a soft foot issue, loosen each foot one at a time, always keeping the others tight, and then retighten while the spectrum is still measuring. Any notable reduction in the one-times (1x) energy during the loosening process can be a strong indication of the relief of machine frame distortion. The graphs in Figure 3 display typical before and after conditions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=160 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_3a-radial-measure-vertical.gif" width=226&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 3a. Before the loosening sequence: &lt;BR&gt;All four feet are tightened; the 1X amplitude &lt;BR&gt;is 0.127 inches/second. Radial measurements&lt;BR&gt;were taken in the vertical direction.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=133 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_3b-measurements-off-sequenc.gif" width=226&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 3b. After the loosening sequence:&lt;BR&gt;One of the four feet was loose; the 1X &lt;BR&gt;amplitude is now 0.048 inches/second.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a great indication of which foot has the greatest impact on relief of soft foot distortion, but you will need to further investigate with a good laser alignment tool, dial indicator or feeler gauges to properly measure and correct the problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Often, the soft foot signature or pattern is hard to detect. Commonly, soft foot appears at 1x the running speed of the equipment, both axially and radially, but is occasionally present at two and three times RPM. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since soft foot can also affect alignment, misalignment characteristics may appear. The best indication of soft foot is an elevated 1x RPM vibration value. This is typically in the neighborhood of 0.3 inches/second or higher. Very often, there is a significant 2x alternate current line frequency peak. The presence of this peak helps differentiate soft foot from imbalance and misalignment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Using Phase Analysis &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The signature of soft foot sometimes appears similar to looseness because the foot may, in fact, be loose. Foot looseness may emerge due to weakness in the base plate or foundation, deterioration of the grouting, loose hold-down bolts, or a cracked or broken foot. All of these situations are part of machine frame distortion. Phase analysis will help reveal this. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Phase analysis documents the relative motion between two different points. You can use it to determine continuity between two adjacent pieces of machinery (i.e., machine frame and supporting foundation). Phase analysis may show a 90- to 180-degree phase difference between vertical measurements on the bolt, machine foot, base plate or base (Figure 2). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=141 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_vertical-measurements.jpg" width=275&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2. Phase relationship can show differences&lt;BR&gt;between vertical measurements on the bolt,&lt;BR&gt;machine foot, base plate or base.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A quick way to acquire this data is with a data collector that offers cross-channel phase measurements. This allows the user to take vibration readings with an accelerometer and ascertain the phase information without the use of a tachometer. This saves a considerable amount of time due to the skipped setup time that is necessary when a tachometer is used to collect phase data. &lt;/P&gt;
