      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) has issued a &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dep/recycle/priorities/orgecon-study.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that claims that the Massachusetts Commercial Food Waste Ban, implemented in 2014, has created more than 900 jobs and stimulated $175 million in economic activity across the Commonwealth during the first two years of the ban.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ban requires any commercial organization that disposes of one ton or more a week of food waste to pull it out of the waste stream and reuse it, send it for composting or animal feed operations or use it in an anaerobic digestion facility that produces renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âMassachusetts' leadership has helped keep food out of landfills and incinerators, while driving the growth of innovative new Massachusetts-based businesses,â says Governor Charlie Baker. âOur Administration is committed to implementing the ban by working to reduce our waste stream and support Massachusetts' growing clean energy economy.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âMassachusetts continues to lead the nation in striving to reduce food waste,â says Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito. âThe study findings emphasize how these efforts can create new jobs and economic opportunities, while producing clean energy and other valuable products.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report, conducted by &lt;a href="https://www.icf.com/" target="_blank"&gt;ICF International Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Cambridge, Massachusetts, assessed the economic development benefits of food waste reduction initiatives. The study compared jobs and economic activity among food waste haulers; composting, anaerobic digestion and animal feed operations; and food rescue organizations before and after the Oct. 1, 2014 implementation of MassDEP's commercial organics waste ban. ICF found that the ban creates jobs by driving a market for alternatives to disposing of food waste in the trash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, commissioned by the Baker-Polito Administration, shows that food waste haulers and processors, as well as food rescue organizations, employ 500 people directly, while supporting more than 900 jobs when accounting for indirect and induced effects. These sectors generate more than $46 million of labor income and $175 million in economic activity in the Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âThis study highlights the innovative ways that Massachusetts businesses are helping to protect our environment while growing our economy,â says Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Matthew Beaton. âThe Baker Polito Administration remains dedicated to the idea that organic material is not 'waste,' but a resource that can be used to help feed people, improve our agricultural output, and produce clean, renewable energy through anaerobic digestion.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the survey results, Massachusetts haulers are collecting an estimated 270,000 tons of food materials annually, showing tremendous growth over Massachusetts' baseline estimate of 100,000 tons of food waste diversion prior to implementation of the commercial organics waste ban. Jobs in the sector grew by 150 percent between 2010 and 2015, and these businesses project an additional 50 percent job growth from 2016 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also found that food scrap haulers and processors are planning significant additional growth in facility and equipment expenditures in the year ahead, with more than $50 million in additional expenditures planned for 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âMassachusetts businesses have been able to cost-effectively reduce disposal of food and divert it to higher value uses, such as food donation, animal feed, composting and renewable energy,â says MassDEP Commissioner Martin Suuberg. âThe results of this study show that the ban has been both a success in reducing the waste stream and a stimulant for economic growth.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approximately 1,700 facilities, including restaurants, hotels and conference centers, universities, supermarkets and food processors, were covered under the ban.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.highplainsbioenergy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;High Plains Bioenergy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(HPB), Shawnee Mission, Kansas, a subsidiary of Shawnee Mission, Kansas-based &lt;a href="http://www.seaboardfoods.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Seaboard Foods&lt;/a&gt;, recently announced plans to upgrade its anaerobic digestion-derived biogas to renewable natural gas using an Essen, Germany-based &lt;a href="http://www.carbotech.info/" target="_blank"&gt;Carbotech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pressure swing adsorption system from &lt;a href="http://www.biofermenergy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bioferm Energy Systems/Viessmann Group&lt;/a&gt;, Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located in Guymon, Oklahoma, HPBâs facility currently fuels boilers with the biogas created from the anaerobic digestion of food processing pork waste, but has identified gas upgrading and natural gas grid injection as a better alternative biogas end-use to enable the highest possible return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;âOne strategic element of our business model is an emphasis on identifying opportunities which result in economic as well as environmental benefits through the use of Seaboard Foodsâ various waste streams. After a long and comprehensive vetting process, we have decided to partner with Bioferm on this project. Their commitment to cutting-edge technology and unmatched output gas specifications were among the many reasons for our decision,â says Gene Binder, director of sales and business development at HPB.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biofermâs installation in Guymon will consist of a complete, integrated gas upgrading systemâfrom biogas filtration, to biogas compression, through upgrading to natural gas pipeline quality requirements and treatment of off gasâincluding a performance guarantee and comprehensive control system for the whole package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the selected Carbotech Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) technology provides the marketâs lowest operating costs compared to other gas upgrading systems.&lt;br&gt;HPBâs dedication to clean energy, fuel and waste management alternatives from and for Seaboard Foodsâ operations helps promote sustainable food systems and communities. Aiding these efforts, their new BUP2000 gas upgrading system will annually produce 440 million standard cubic feet (scf) of renewable natural gas (RNG) for grid injection at full capacityâequivalent to 3,371,544 gas gallon equivalentâs (GGE) per year and displacing the gasoline usage for approximately 6,743 cars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âSeaboard Foods and High Plains Bioenergy showcase an unparalleled industry model for sustainability through their commitment to renewables. We at Bioferm Energy Systems are excited in working with such a professional team to help create the best value for their biogas in the form of clean RNG fuel by deploying a complete state-of the-art gas upgrading system,â says Nadeem Afghan, president and CEO of Bioferm Energy Systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once finished, HPBâs Carbotech PSA upgrading system will have a raw biogas processing capacity of 1200 scf per minute and an expected product gas composition with &amp;nbsp;almost 96 percent methane despite the high oxygen and nitrogen portion in the raw gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key features of Carbotech PSA include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turnkey system offerings with all necessary upgrading components&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capable of meeting stringent pipeline requirements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removes oxygen from the gas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removes nitrogen from the gas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use no chemicals and minimal process water for desulphurization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capable of handling high-nitrogen gas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In-house volatile organic compound (VOC) removal technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High methane yield and no increased methane losses over time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low operating costs and system efficiency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modular approach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology emphasis on high processing efficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[The city of Edmonton, Alberta in collaboration with the University of Alberta and &lt;a href="http://www.biofermenergy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bioferm Energy Systems&lt;/a&gt;, Madison, Wisconsin, will begin constructing an anaerobic digester to create energy from its organic waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bioferm High-Solids (Bioferm Dry Fermentation) anaerobic digester will aid Edmonton with its goals of diverting 90 percent of residential waste from going to landfill and to reduce greenhouse emissions. Anaerobic digestion technology in Edmonton will be incorporated into the cityâs existing composting operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The facility is sized to initially process 40,000 tons per year of high-solids, organic waste supplied by the city of Edmonton and the University of Alberta. However, the chosen design can handle 48,000 tons per year of organics. This waste will primarily include municipal solid waste, source separated organics from industrial, commercial and institutional waste sectors and yard waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 1.426 megawatts electric &amp;nbsp;combined heat and power unit will have a 1.426 megawatt electrical capacity and a 1.5 megawatt thermal capacity. Average annual energy production includes 12.5 million kilowatt hours of electrical production and 45,300 million British thermal units of thermal production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The estimated energy could provide electricity to 1,107 homes and heat 1,031 homes per year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The methane produced and used is equivalent to the avoided release of 46,000 metric tons carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, and the energy generated is equivalent to reducing emissions from 11,786 metric tons CO2 per year from a conventional bituminous coal facility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The facility will produce approximately 20,000 tons of high-quality compost for sale. Ten million dollars in funding has been committed from the Climate Change and Emission Management Corporation.]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[The dry fermentation anaerobic digester by Madison, Wisconsin-based &lt;a href="http://www.biofermenergy.com" target="_blank"&gt;Bioferm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh (UWO), dubbed âBiodigester I,â &amp;nbsp;is the first industrial-scale dry fermentation anaerobic digestion plant in the Americas, the company says. The facility serves as a living, learning laboratory for students and faculty and furthers the universityâs goals to create a sustainable campus with a net zero impact on the climate and environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The facility can handle up to 8,000 tons of organics at a time including campus and nearby food waste, yard waste and crop residue, produces 2,320,000 kilowatt hours on average a year and supplies as much as 15 percent of UWOâs electrical needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The total footprint of the facility is 19,000 square feet, with a storage area of 2,000 square feet and a mixing area of 7,800 square feet. There are four fermentation vessels, each 70 feet by 23 feet by 16.7 feet. Each cycle is 28 days long, with 13 maximum material exchanges per yearâaround 150 tons of fresh material per exchange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The methane produced and used is equivalent to the avoided release of 9,641 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) equivalent. Electricity generation from these renewable sources is equivalent to reducing 2,339 metric tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year from a conventional bituminous coal facility or 1,372 metric tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year produced from a natural gas facility.]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:19:44 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[Refuse and recyclable materials collection remains the fith most dangerous job in the U.S., according to &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov" target="_blank"&gt;the Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(BLS). The 2015 National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries released shows that the rate of fatalities among waste collection workers has risen since 2014. The results of this report highlight the necessity and value of ongoing safety programming within the industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2015 BLS data for collection workers show a rate of 38.8 fatalities per 100,000 full-time employees, up from 35.8 in 2014. This continues an upward trend in the rate since 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://swana.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Solid Waste Association of North America&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SWANA), Silver Spring, Maryland, says it continues its efforts to educate and advance awareness for better industry safety practices through its integrated Safety Matters program and access to free safety-focused resources online and in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âAlthough we feel we have been making progress, this data show we are not yet where we need to be,â says Luann Meyer, safety ambassador of SWANA's New York Chapter. âWe have to keep making safety a top priority.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Safety Matters webpage is an resource portal that serves as a central place for SWANA members and other industry professionals to access the latest in safety news, important safety materials and upcoming safety events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Included on the webpage is information about each of SWANAâs safety initiativesâincluding the Safety Ambassador program, Slow Down to Get Around decal distribution, Safety Awardsâand direct links to outside resources, such as &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;the Occupational Safety &amp;amp; Health Administration&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(OSHA) and &lt;a href="http://www.ccohs.ca/" target="_blank"&gt;the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(CCOHS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âWe are not surprised by the BLS data, as we track all fatalities in the U.S. and Canada involving waste personnel and equipment," says SWANA Executive Director and CEO David Biderman. "Thereâs lots of work to be done to get the waste collection industry off the list of top 10 most dangerous jobs in the U.S. With our Safety Matters webpage and frequent workshops across the country, our goal is to provide the helpful and necessary resources to contribute to reducing accidents and injuries in the industry. Nothing we do is more important.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SWANAâs fifth annual Safety Summit, as part of SWANApalooa 2017 in Reno, Nevada,  March 27-30, 2017, will provide special sessions focused on safety throughout the waste management cycle. Starting with the collection of materials and continuing through processing, landfilling, composting and recycling, industry experts will discuss how safety can and should be a core value in all waste industry operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This curated program track will provide a look at the state of safety today and provide attendees with great new techniques for building a positive safety culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âUnfortunately itâs the nature of the business that our workers are exposed to increased risk with heavy equipment and the types of work they are doing,â says David Horne, SWANA Pennsylvania Eastern Region safety ambassador. âThe solid waste industry needs to keep fighting the fight, as far as safety is concerned, so we can start moving in a positive direction from year to year.â]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 11:49:40 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;a href="http://mrcmaine.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Maine Municipal Review Committee&lt;/a&gt;, Ellsworth, Maine, and &lt;a href="http://www.percwte.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Penobscot Energy Recovery Co. &lt;/a&gt;(PERC), Orrington, Maine, have withdrawn their ongoing lawsuits against each other,&lt;a href="http://www.centralmaine.com/2016/12/15/groups-representing-maine-waste-interests-agree-to-drop-lawsuits-against-each-other/" target="_blank"&gt; a report by centralmaine.com says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The Municipal Review Committee, which represents the solid waste interests of 187 Maine municipalities, and PERC reached an agreement to end their relationship in march 2018, the report says. The reached agreements can allow the planned Cantonsville, Maryland-headquartered &lt;a href="http://fiberight.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Fiberight&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;waste-to-energy facility in Hampden, Maine, to move forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the report, the Hampden facility is still scheduled to accept waste on its planned date of April 1, 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2014, the Municipal Review Committee filed a suit against USA Energy Group LLC, the managing general partner of PERC, accusing the company of violating its partnership agreement by using municipal funding to pay off a $1.2 million bill for lobbying legislation communities were opposed to in 2014. USA Energy filed a countersuit, which came as the committee was rallying member communities to sign up for the Fiberight proposal after the PERC contract expires in 2018, the report says. Both lawsuits have been dismissed without judgement against either party and cannot be brought back to court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The committee will receive $600,000 from PERC in exchange for giving up the member communitiesâ abilities to become partial owners of PERC by calling in their shares after the contract ends, the report says. The money will be dispersed throughout member communities, and fees from tonnage shortfalls will be waived as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PERC still has an ongoing appeal with the Kennebec County Superior Court on permits for the Fiberight facility. Because of this, the committee deferred consideration of financial closure from its original date of Jan. 1, 2017 to May 1.]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>RES Polyflow commissions rapid diagnostic tool for evaluating nonrecycled plastic</title>
      <description>RUFUS designed to prequalify raw materials for plastics-to-fuel recovery technology.</description>
      <link>http://www.rewmag.com/Article/res-polyflow-commissions-rapid-diagnostic-tool-plastic</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 14:24:30 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[Chagrin Falls, Ohio-based manufacturer &lt;a href="http://www.respolyflow.com" target="_blank"&gt;RES Polyflow&lt;/a&gt; has announced it has developed a rapid assessment solution designed to prequalify raw materials for the companyâs proprietary plastic to fuel energy recovery technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Remote Universal Feedstock Utilization System, or RUFUS, is a mobile diagnostic tool that uses pyrolysis to convert nonrecycled plastic to a liquid hydrocarbon for on-the-spot analysis that determines the quality of the raw material for conversion to petroleum products. Using RUFUS, nonrecycled plastic is now able to be evaluated against graded raw material specifications that support the financial and operational performance goals of a RES Polyflow plastics-to-fuel facility using this assessment tool. Development of the RUFUS system was funded in part by a market development grant awarded to the company by the Ohio EPA in 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When operated, RUFUS determines the percentage of hydrocarbon value that is recoverable from nonrecycled plastic and then analyzes the liquid to determine if the raw material offered by a supply source is technically and financially viable for conversion at commercial scale rather than discarding as a waste material. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system can be utilized at the companyâs northeast Ohio-based technical center and in the marketplace at the source of the supply. In addition to evaluating supply sources throughout Ohio and the Midwest, the company is building a collaboration with Trine University in Angola, Indiana, and the Northeast Indiana Solid Waste Management District to identify and prequalify localized raw material streams generated across a four-county area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RES Polyflow says it is in the midst of a capital raise that, when completed, will fully fund the construction and start-up of the first commercial plastics to fuel facility in the United States, located in Ashley, Indiana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://quantumbiopower.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/fileuploads/image/2016/12/Quantum%20Biopower-Facility.gif" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" alt="Quantum Biopower"&gt;Quantum Biopower&lt;/a&gt; celebrated the completion of Connecticutâs first food waste to renewable energy facility in Southington with a ribbon cutting ceremony on Nov. 15. The ceremony, held on Connecticut Recycles Day, marked the completed construction of Connecticutâs first anaerobic digester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Connecticutâs food waste diversion mandate, which requires that certain food waste generators producing more than 2 tons of food waste per week or more separate out that waste from their other garbage and send it to a compost facility or digester for recycling, was a driving force in the development and completion of the digester.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âThis facility is the result of the convergence of forward thinking renewable energy and waste reduction efforts championed by the state of Connecticut,â says Brian Paganini, vice president and managing director of Quantum Biopower. âQuantum is proud to be the first developer to succeed in this new area and is committed to being a sustainability leader in our local community and the state.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Southington food waste to renewable energy facility will receive source separated organic waste from supermarkets, food processors, schools and banquet halls and turn that waste into renewable electricity and compost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of its feedstock is under contract with area food waste generators such as Shop Rite, the Aqua Turf and the Farmington Club.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum Biopowerâs digester has been under development for three years and is the first of its kind to be built in Connecticut. Once up and running, the facility will divert 40,000 tons per year of food waste from the waste stream for more environmentally responsible management through recycling. Each year, Connecticut manages more than 2 million tons of trash, 25 percent (500,000 tons) of which is food waste. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) worked with Quantum from the beginning to complete permitting process and both parties are pleased that this day has finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;âBringing this facility on-line is consistent with a key focus on the stateâs new Comprehensive Materials Management Strategy - diverting organic material from our waste stream. With the help of this first-in-the-state facility we are paving the way for a 21st century approach to management of our trash by turning waste food into affordable energy,â says DEEP Commissioner Robert Klee. âThis is a âwinâ for both our efforts to reduce costs of trash disposal and our focus on developing new sources of power.â&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quantum received a $2 million low interest loan from the Connecticut Green Bank toward the $14 million project. The Town of Southington has also partnered in the project by agreeing to purchase the energy produced by the facility to supply various government buildings in town through the virtual net metering program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The facility is planned to begin operations by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

The company will operate the facility for 25 years, and will be built, on FCC Environmentâs behalf by a joint venture between FCC and by Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The facility, which is set to begin operation by 2019, will treat around 135,000 metric tons of household residual waste a year, and a further 20,000 metric tons of commercial waste a year, and will generate sufficient electricity each year to satisfy the energy demands of up to approximately 32,000 households. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antonio Alfonso, managing director, head of FCC Environment International, says, "we are delighted to start work on the Millerhill Resource and Energy Recovery Centre. This is an important project for the local community and for FCC. Municipalities and authorities around the world face difficult environmental challenges and this facility will further demonstrate our capabilities in delivering effective energy-from-waste solutions under a public-private partnership approach.â &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to work on the Millerhill Resource and Energy Recovery Centre (RERC), FCC has also recently opened an energy from waste (EfW) facility in Buckinghamshire, U.K. In the US FCC is currently constructing on a Materials Recycling Facility on the McCommas Bluff Landfill site in southern Dallas, Texas, and the company has also been shortlisted for the Belgrade EfW facility in Serbia. &lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Public CNG refueling station opens in Sherbrooke, Quebec</title>
      <description>The station became part of a network of CNG refueling stations called the Blue Road.</description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;a href="http://sani-estrie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sani-Estrie&lt;/a&gt;, Sherbrooke, Quebec, and natural gas distributor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gazmetro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gaz MÃ©tro&lt;/a&gt;, Montreal, Quebec,opened the first public refueling station for compressed natural gas (CNG) has been set up in the Eastern Townships. The fueling station is the tenth such installation to join the Blue Road, a network of public natural gas refueling stations. Located at 405 Rodolphe-Racine Street, in Sherbrooke, and operated by Sani-Estrie, this station will be accessible to the public, more specifically to transportation companies and municipalities who use or who wish to adopt this alternative fuel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Economic recovery is a priority for our government. We want to modernize QuÃ©bec's economy through the energy transition announced in the 2030 Energy Policy. Thus, ensuring access to natural gas to as many regions as possible will enable us to achieve the objectives that we have set for ourselves. I am delighted about the installation of a public natural gas fueling station in the Eastern Townships, since the use of this resource will help promote this transition to a low-carbon economy," says Minister of Energy and Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Plan Nord, Pierre Arcand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sani-Estrie made the switch to natural gas just over a year ago when it acquired nine new CNG trucks, with the goal of converting 30 more over the next five years. "We are very pleased to offer a new CNG fueling point for QuÃ©bec-based and particularly local transporters, so they may benefit, as do we, from the numerous advantages of natural gas, especially from an economic and environmental perspective," says Sani-Estrie's vice president, Sylvain GagnÃ©. "It is crucial for companies such as ours to remain at the leading edge of industry trends in order to stand out from other players in the sector."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new refueling point on the Blue Road will allow companies who fill their trucks with this alternative fuel to travel from the Eastern Townships to Montreal and have the possibility of reaching the U.S. "The proximity of highways 10 and 55 made Sherbrooke a prime location for pursuing the deployment of the Blue Road," says Martin Imbleau, vice president, development and renewable energies at Gaz MÃ©tro. "We salute Sani-Estrie for their decision to make the switch to natural gas and to provide an additional fuel point on the Blue Road."]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Carbon Cycle Energy breaks ground on biogas plant in North Carolina</title>
      <description>Company will turn food waste into pipeline-grade biomethane for Duke Energy.</description>
      <link>http://www.rewmag.com/Article/carbon-cycle-duke-biogas</link>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.c2-energy.com" target="_blank"&gt;Carbon Cycle Energy&lt;/a&gt; (C2e),&amp;nbsp;Boulder, Colorado, has broken ground on what the company says is the largest utility-scale biogas facility in the United States. When fully operational the facility, to be built near Warsaw, North Carolina, will transform animal and food waste into enough energy to power 32,000 homes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/fileuploads/image/REW/CarbonCycle2web.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"&gt;The$100-million facility is the first in a pipeline of large-scale anaerobic digestion and biogas treatment facilities planned by C2e.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biogas facility, located on 82 acres, is slated to be complete by late 2017. To be known as C2e Renewables NC, it will process more than 750,000 tons of organic waste per year and will produce enough fuel annually to generate about 290,000 MWH of electricity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C2e has already signed contracts to supply 100 percent of the plant's output of biomethane to the utility firm Duke Energy and a second, unnamed Fortune 500 company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At full capacity, the plant will generate 6,500 dekatherms of biomethane per day, equivalent to roughly 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The sheer size of this project means that it will have a huge environmental impact, both by addressing the major pollution problem caused by greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing food and animal waste, and by producing an alternative to fossil fuels in commercially significant volumes," says James Powell, C2eâs CEO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C2e has secured access to a variety of organic waste streams, comprised of manure and other agricultural waste as well as industrial food processing waste, which will be converted by anaerobic digesters into raw biogas, upgraded on site and injected directly into the natural gas pipeline system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jerry Kovacich, COO and co-founder of C2e, described the company's sophisticated waste transport system design approach as one that maximizes the use of "closed-system to closed-system" technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"By ensuring that vital energy value is not lost in the form of fugitive air emissions, odors are also dramatically reduced. Residents near our plants will actually be exposed to fewer odors and less risk of water contamination than what's often been experienced by neighbors of hog farm and pork processing operations in the past," Kovacich says.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Wheelabrator Technologies financially closes on UK energy recovery facility</title>
      <description>The 220,000-ton-per-year facility will generate 18.8 megawatts of electricity.</description>
      <link>http://www.rewmag.com/Article/wheelabrator-technologies-closes-on-uk-facility</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2016 13:43:51 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;a href="http://www.wtienergy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Wheelabrator Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, reached financial close on a new, 220,000 tons-per-year energy recovery facility, with construction to commence in January 2017 on the Deeside Industrial Park in Flintshire, North Wales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âTo achieve financial close is a significant milestone and Iâm extremely proud of our team for making this possible,â says Wheelabrator President and CEO Robert Boucher. âThis is the result of six years of hard work and negotiations, and Iâm excited to welcome our third U.K. facility to our global fleet.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelabrator Parc Adfer will be a combined heat and power enabled facility which will generate 18.8 megawatts (gross)/16.6 megawatts (net) of sustainable electricity to meet the needs of over 30,000 U.K. homes and businesses. The facility will also be capable of providing valuable steam or heat to local industry and housing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Progress to reach close on this $223 million financing follows the award of planning consent by Flintshire County Council's Planning and Development Control Committee in May 2015 and an Environmental Permit by Natural Resources Wales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2014, Wheelabrator was selected as preferred bidder to build and operate the facility over the next 25 years as a public-private partnership (PPP), with support from the Welsh Government to serve the five local authorities that make up the North Wales Residual Waste Treatment Project (NWRWTP)--Conwy County Borough Council, Denbighshire County Council, Flintshire County Council, Gwynedd Council and the Isle of Anglesey County Council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Residual waste fuel for the facility will be provided primarily by the five authorities, which initiated the procurement to achieve long-term targets for recycling and diversion of waste from landfill. A further long-term contract is in place with a top tier waste management company, ensuring that over 70 percent of the facilityâs fuel supply is hedged at fixed prices. The remaining capacity at the facility will be offered to commercial waste collection companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheelabrator said that site preparation work will start immediately and full construction of the facility is set to commence in 2017. The construction phase is expected to result in hundreds of additional jobs and create around 35 new, full-time operational roles at the facility when plant operations commence in 2019.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âThe Parc Adfer facility is an example of our ongoing commitment to investing in new and necessary energy recovery infrastructure across the U.K.,â says Wheelabratorâs U.K. Managing Director Paul Green. âWe remain focused on developing our pipeline for growth and building long-lasting relationships with the five North Wales authorities and commercial waste companies across the U.K. Weâre committed to bringing our experience and industry expertise to Wheelabrator Parc Adfer and delivering a facility of the highest safety and operational performance standards.â&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parc Adfer is Wheelabratorâs third energy recovery facility in the U.K., which in total represents over 1.43 million tons of residual waste treatment capacity.]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wm.com/index.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;Waste Management&lt;/a&gt;, Houston, released its 2016 sustainability report titled &lt;a href="http://sustainability.wm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report highlights progress toward making recycling sustainable, reducing the companyâs greenhouse gas footprint, keeping employees and communities safe and giving back to the communities it serves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the report, the companyâs president and CEO, Jim Fish, highlights the important and growing focus on making recycling sustainable over the long term. âItâs time for recycling to evolve. Weâve started to see progress on this front, and steady progress is what we needâfor the good times and the bad,â said Fish. âWhen we encounter roadblocks like those weâve seen in our recycling business over the past few years, we see our role as leading change to overcome them.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional 2016 report highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowering emissionsâ&lt;/strong&gt;In 2015, the companyâs greenhouse gas (GHG)-reducing servicesârecycling, landfill renewable natural gas projects, landfill gas-to-energy projects and carbon sequestration in landfillsâsaved over three times the total greenhouse gas emissions its operations generated all year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing energy at the landfillâ&lt;/strong&gt;Waste Managementâs landfill-gas-to-energy facilities power the equivalent of 470,000 households, offsets 2.5 million tons of coal per year and offsets 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing cleaner fleetâ&lt;/strong&gt;In 2015, the company operated more than 5,100 of natural gas vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recyclingâ&lt;/strong&gt;Waste Management recycled and composted more than 14 million tons of materials from the waste stream in 2015. To adapt to recycling challenges, the company has worked to increase operational efficiencies and lower operating costs at recycling facilities; as well as work with customers, communities and environmental organizations across the country to get the word out on contamination and reinvigorate a spirit of environmental stewardship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing wasteâ&lt;/strong&gt;By working with myriad businesses and organizations, Waste Management helped create customized solutions that lower waste production, increase reuse and improve the recyclability of products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also includes statistics on the companyâs environmental performance, from fleet emissions to wildlife habitat protection to the variety of materials managed each year.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;A ruling by a state panel in Maine appears poised to help keep four biomass energy plants in that state operating into 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/maine-regulators-approve-13-million-biomass-subsidy#stream/0" target="_blank"&gt;an online report&lt;/a&gt; on the Maine Public website, Maine legislators approved a subsidy plan in April of 2016 and assigned the stateâs Public Utilities Commission to work out the details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;In mid-December 2016, the commission has approved a $13 million subsidy plan that accepts bids from two companies that operate two biomass plants each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reenergyholdings.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Re-Energy Holdings LLC&lt;/a&gt;, Latham, New York, and France-based Stored Solar LLC, which owns plants under the Capergy name, each have been awarded two-year contracts to accept subsidies to keep those plants productive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;Re-Energyâs plants are in Fort Fairfield and Ashland, Maine. The Capergy plants in West Enfield and Jonesboro, Maine, have been idle since the spring of 2016 but will reopen upon receipt of the state subsidy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;The Stored Solar/Capergy plants were purchased by the French firm in October 2016 from their previous operator Covanta of Morristown, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;A mid-December &lt;a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2016/12/13/business/biomass-bailout-to-restart-former-covanta-plants-boost-aroostook-generators/" target="_blank"&gt;news report&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;i&gt;Bangor Daily News&lt;/i&gt; says Stored Solar has been indicating the two biomass plants will serve as the beginning of a larger investment in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;The newspaper says in a September 2016 presentation to a trade group, Stored Solar says its plan âcalls for the repurposing of existing sites as energy parks, aquaculture, greenhouses and biofuel manufacturing facilities.â That statement can be &lt;a href="http://www.swoam.org/Events/Calendar/tabid/91/ModuleID/491/ItemID/410/mctl/EventDetails/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;found&amp;nbsp;on the website&lt;/a&gt; of the Small Woodland Owners Association of Maine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;The Forest Resources Association of Maine has reported in its December 2016 newsletter that Stored Solar has begun buying wood fuel for both biomass plants and the company intends to restart them before the end of 2016, according to the &lt;i&gt;Daily News&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;âIn addition to the existing biomass energy plants, Stored Solar LLC is seeking heat and steam users to co-locate at the facilities and is pursuing funding for a biorefinery,â the newsletter states, according to the &lt;i&gt;Daily News&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;]]&gt;</content:encoded>
