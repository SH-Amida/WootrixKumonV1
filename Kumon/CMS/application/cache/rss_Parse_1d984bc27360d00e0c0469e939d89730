    <title>California Decides the Future for Solar Is Net Metering</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546156/california-decides-the-future-for-solar-is-net-metering/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;New state regulations attempt to strike a balance between rooftop solar owners and utilities in the nationâs largest solar market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a victory for the solar power industry, Californiaâs Public Utility Commission voted Thursday to approve new regulations for net meteringâthe compensation to residential solar power owners for excess electricity that they return to the grid. The regulations will help set a course for distributed renewable energy in the largest solar market in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Problem with Biofuels</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546196/the-problem-with-biofuels/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy is touting its âGreat Green Fleet,â but why havenât biofuels made a bigger splash despite a decade of hype and investment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week the U.S. Navy, with its accustomed pomp and fanfare, launched its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/21/us-navy-launches-first-biofuel-powered-aircraft-carriers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first carrier strike group powered partly by biofuelâ&lt;/a&gt;in this case, a blend made primarily from beef fat. The biofueled warships form a central element of the Navyâs &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil/energy/great-green-fleet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Great Green Fleet&lt;/a&gt; program to draw half of its power from clean energy sources, rather than petroleum, by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The key will be a nationwide, modernized grid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Two companies will receive $80 million from the federal government to build molten-salt reactors and pebble-bed reactors by the mid-2020s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest sign of the U.S. governmentâs determination to help push nuclear power technology beyond conventional reactors, the Department of Energy is providing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-investments-advanced-nuclear-power-reactors-help-meet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$80 million in funding to two advanced reactor programs&lt;/a&gt;. At $40 million each in matching funds over the next five years, the grants will go to X-energy, a little-known Maryland-based startup that is developing a new version of a pebble-bed reactor, and to Southern Company, the Atlanta-based utility that is working with TerraPower on molten-salt reactors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>2015 Was the Warmest Year on Record, and It Wasnât Even Close </title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545791/2015-was-the-warmest-year-on-record-and-it-wasnt-even-close/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Warming oceans and a sharp rise in air temperatures show that climate change is in full effect â and may be outstripping predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The numbers are in, and they are unforgiving: 2015 was the hottest year on record, and it wasnât even close. The announcement was expectedâscientists monitoring global temperatures predicted before the end of the year that 2015 would set a record for warmth, in part because of the massive El NiÃ±o event currently under way in the Pacific Ocean. But the data released today confirm that human-induced global warming is pushing temperatures higher at an alarming rate: 2014 was the previous record holder for global average surface temperature, clocking in at 0.57 Â°C above the 1960 to 1990 average, but last year was 0.75 Â°C above that average.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>California Gas Leak Exposes Growing Natural-Gas Risks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545571/california-gas-leak-exposes-growing-natural-gas-risks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As America shifts toward natural gas for energy, decaying pipelines and storage facilities are at risk of leaks and explosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it was first detected on October 23, 2015, the natural-gas leak at Aliso Canyon, a Southern California Gas Co. storage facility in the bucolic Porter Ranch community, has spewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edf.org/climate/aliso-canyon-leak-sheds-light-national-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 86,000 metric tons of methane&lt;/a&gt; into the atmosphere. On Monday So Cal Gas said it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-porter-ranch-leak-stopped-late-february-20160118-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;abandoned a plan&lt;/a&gt; to capture and burn off the gas, which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. That means a solution to the disaster is still weeks, if not months, off. (This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/porter-ranch-california-methane-gas-leak-crisis-412807&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long feature on Newsweek.com&lt;/a&gt; explores in detail the background of the leak.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Why Renewable Energy Is Defying Gravity</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545516/why-renewable-energy-is-defying-gravity/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Growth in renewable energy shows no signs of slowing, even though fossil fuel prices have plummeted. Hereâs why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data released yesterday by &lt;a href=&quot;http://about.bnef.com/press-releases/clean-energy-defies-fossil-fuel-price-crash-to-attract-record-329bn-global-investment-in-2015/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg New Energy Finance&lt;/a&gt;, a record $329 billion was invested in clean energy worldwide in 2015. Last year was also the strongest ever for installations of renewable energy capacity, with 64 gigawatts of wind and 57 gigawatts of solar power commissioned. Given the relentless plunge in oil prices, now flirting with $30 a barrel, that seems counterintuitive: conventional wisdom says that cheap fossil fuels inhibit the growth of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Canadian startup pursuing an advanced molten-salt nuclear reactor gets significant outside backing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising developers of advanced nuclear power plants, the Canadian startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrestrialenergy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Terrestrial Energy&lt;/a&gt;, has landed &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrestrialenergy.com/terrestrial-energy-announces-completion-of-cad10-million-series-a-funding/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$7 million in funding&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The Dubious Promise of Bioenergy Plus Carbon Capture</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544736/the-dubious-promise-of-bioenergy-plus-carbon-capture/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change agreements rest on negative emissions technologies that may be unachievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many scientists and climate change activists hailed Decemberâs Paris agreement as a historic step forward for international efforts to limit global warming, the landmark accord rests on a highly dubious assumption: to achieve the goal of limiting the rise in global average temperature to less than 2 Â°C (much less the more ambitious goal of 1.5 Â°C), we donât just need to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to essentially zero by the end of this century. We also must remove from the atmosphere huge amounts of carbon dioxide that have already been emitted (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544551/paris-climate-agreement-rests-on-shaky-technological-foundations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;âParis Climate Agreement Rests on Shaky Technological Foundationsâ&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A roundup of the best stories on energy from other sites, collected by Richard Martin, &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;âs senior editor for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-30/china-to-suspend-new-coal-mine-approvals-amid-pollution-fight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;China to Halt New Coal Mine Approvals Amid Pollution Fight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the Chinese economy in freefall, the slow-motion contraction of its coal industry (which I reported on in my 2015 book &lt;em&gt;Coal Wars&lt;/em&gt;) has turned into a full-scale retreat, reports Bloomberg News. The latest signal from the central government is the suspension of new coal mine approvals for at least the next three years. Coal use in China is falling nearly as fast as it is in the developed countries of Europe and North Americaâbut because coal-fired power has been so ubiquitous, coal is expected to fall to less than 63 percent of Chinaâs overall energy consumption in 2016, according to the National Energy Agency. The government plans to close more than 1,000 mines this year, further exacerbating the growing unemployment in the interior provinces. The overhang in the industry is still huge: more than 20 percent of the countryâs coal production capacity will be idle in 2016 as heavy industries slow and the government tries to reach its target of 20 percent renewable energy by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers say theyâve overcome an obstacle to making highly efficient solar devices by combining silicon with a new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon probably wonât be replaced as the dominant solar material anytime soon, but it might not be too long before it gets a partner from a promising class of materials called perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
