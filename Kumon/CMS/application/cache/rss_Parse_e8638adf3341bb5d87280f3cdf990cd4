            <title>5-S Methods to Enhance Green Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/7/e07cf0e5-7045-4c6d-b0bb-38089df2aad5_green-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Manufacturing industries play a tug-of-war between the public and private sectors, each demanding the fastest, cheapest and highest quality products with the lowest environmental impact. Cap-and-trade emissions policies, paired with limited natural resources, have changed the face of modern industry. As a result, lean companies, particularly those with established 5-S systems, are one step ahead of the green curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Lean initiatives work well with green initiatives because you&amp;#39;re looking at costs and how much waste is in the process,&amp;quot; said Michael Sinocchi, executive editor with Productivity Press, which was founded more than 20 years ago when editors began translating the works of leading Japanese industrial experts on the Toyota Production System (TPS), the heart of the improvement strategy now called lean manufacturing. &amp;quot;With lean the goal was to drive waste out of the process and throw those savings back into the product by charging customers less, having shorter lead times and spending less on inventory. Now it&amp;#39;s driven by demand and resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Green Manufacturing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Green manufacturing goes one step further than lean, examining the environmental impact of processes and materials used in manufacturing. The correlation between companies that implement lean manufacturing processes and green manufacturing is strong, as a reduction in waste saves both time and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have examined the relationship between 5-S and green manufacturing. The EPA reports 5-S systems offer several environmental benefits. For instance, painting machines light colors and cleaning windows can decrease the energy needed for lighting. Painting and cleaning also make it easier for workers to notice spills or leaks quickly, lessening spill response time. This can significantly reduce waste generated from spills and clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regular cleaning decreases the accumulation of cuttings, shavings, dirt and other substances that can contaminate production processes and result in defects. A reduction in defects will lead to considerable environmental benefits because energy and materials are no longer wasted in producing and disposing of defective products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 5-S implementation can also significantly reduce the square footage needed for operations by organizing and disposing of unused equipment and supplies. Less storage space means less energy needed to heat and light the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Removing obstacles and marking main thoroughfares can decrease the potential for accidents that could lead to spills and associated hazardous waste generation, such as spilled material, absorbent pads and clean-up materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizing equipment, parts and materials so they are easy to find can also significantly reduce unneeded consumption. Employees are more likely to finish one batch of chemicals or materials before opening or ordering more, resulting in less chemical waste requiring disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Visual cues, such as signs, placards, scoreboards and laminated procedures in workstations, can be used to increase employee understanding of proper waste handling and management procedures, as well as workplace hazards and appropriate emergency response. Various 5-S techniques can also be used to improve labeling of hazardous materials and wastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, integration with 5-S visual cues and operating procedures can improve employee environmental management through the organization of tools and materials into labeled and color-coded storage locations as well as &amp;quot;kits&amp;quot; that contain just what is needed to perform a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Examining Waste Beyond the Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When green manufacturing is incorporated with 5-S best practices, companies examine efficiencies not only within an individual workspace but also through the overall life of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Initially companies were only focused on the front end of a product &amp;mdash; how to be the best, the cheapest and the fastest to get it out the door to sell it,&amp;quot; Sinocchi said. &amp;quot;Now companies are looking at the overall life of the product &amp;mdash; what environmental impact it has and whether the same production resources will be available 10-15 years from now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric cars can be used as a case study. When Ford offered its first electric car, Toyota had already released the Prius 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Companies like Ford were waiting for the customer demand,&amp;quot; Sinocchi said. &amp;quot;Toyota examined the cost of resources like oil and realized this market will change 10-15 years from now. Companies can either sit back and say something will change or somehow plan for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/n2hrLE9ZFXM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Standing Up for Lean Principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I recently came across a blog about an executive who switched from his traditional &amp;quot;sit-down desk&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;stand-up desk.&amp;quot; He remarked that he loved the new desk and would never switch back. This concept fascinated me, and I investigated it further. I read many articles, and as it turns out, Thomas Jefferson, Ernest Hemingway, Winston Churchill and many others worked on their feet up to 10 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was inspired by this dynamic concept. I thought if implemented creatively, it could benefit supervisors on the production floor. But I knew this was an unusual concept that wouldn&amp;#39;t be accepted right away. I had to try it for a period of time and demonstrate the possibilities. After all, if the stand-up desk is good enough for a man as intelligent as Thomas Jefferson, it&amp;#39;s worth a shot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I wanted to approach this experiment as I would if I was manipulating an assembly line or fabrication operation. So, before building the stand-up desk, I asked myself some very basic questions, many of which were based on 5-S concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I have at my sit-down desk that I can do without? (Seiri: Go through all materials and keep only essential items.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What can I do to ensure that everything has its place? (Seiton: There should be a place for everything, and everything should be in its place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I need to keep the desk area neat and orderly? (SeisÅ: Keep the workplace clean and neat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is my standard work? (Seiketsu: Work practices should be standardized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much space do I really need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I need to maintain comfort while at the desk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I built this desk, I did many trials and errors before bringing it to the floor. It took about a month of contemplation and modification before it was ready. Once I had exactly what I felt could be trialed safely and comfortably, I made the leap and trashed my traditional desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this experiment, I&amp;#39;ll confess I was laughed at and labeled as &amp;quot;wacky&amp;quot; by some of my colleagues. That&amp;#39;s OK; a lot of new ideas receive ridicule before respect. I have now had my new desk for four months, and in my opinion, the stand-up desk has many positive benefits when looking at it from a lean perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/1/30/e3a382f4-b1f7-4344-9963-fdd4e042344f_standing desk.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 500px; height: 143px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is structured much like an assembly operation should be structured. I only have what I need when I need it. All of my materials (phone, keyboard, monitor, files, trash can, etc.) are within arm&amp;#39;s reach. I only have the amount of flat surface my standard work requires. On the occasion that I need more surface for writing or reading (periodical work), I have a flat surface that rolls out from under the desk and can be returned easily. As you can see from the picture, there was a lot of space saved as well &amp;mdash; 50 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everything on my desk has its place. Due to the fact that there is only enough space for what I need, it is very easy to keep neat and organized. I no longer have stacks of random papers, Post-its or folders. On the right side of my desk, I have a broom holder and a dustpan to sweep my area at the end of each day. This task is much easier with the new desk because the floor is visible and accessible on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As far as ergonomics, it is very comfortable. In my research, I found that when standing, it helps to elevate a foot to relieve strain from your back, so I added a bar across the bottom 6 inches from the floor. I also have a padded mat in front of the desk to reduce any fatigue. The monitor is at eye level, and the keyboard is at a height that would suit most individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have found that this desk has made me more active and I feel more energetic. Instead of &amp;quot;zoning out&amp;quot; in front of the computer (which occasionally happens to everyone), I do what I have to do and move on to more activity. This has led me to have faith that this would be a good cultural tool in the manufacturing community when linked with other lean measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have to assume that organizations (including mine) will not make this a standard, but if they do, great. If you decide to try it, remember that it is hard for the first week or so. Just maintain and focus. It gets better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I highly suggest that continuous improvement-driven individuals give this a try. I have read very little negative comments from the people who have tried it. I believe this can help standardize a supervisor&amp;#39;s work, promote dynamic 5-S practices and result in elevated activity on the manufacturing floor. It&amp;#39;s an idea that has been beneficial personally and has the potential to be beneficial to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/4stvMjRPm4Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Your Plant Should Implement 5-S</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the basic tenets of manufacturing is there is never a shortage of challenges. When times are good, the challenge is how to make more on-time deliveries with the least cost possible. In this current economic environment, the challenge is how to make on-time deliveries with the resources available. Regardless of the economic environment, on-time delivery of profitable products that meet the customer expectations is the objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As companies reduce employees, it gets more difficult to meet the objective. People with the knowledge of certain tasks leave the business, just as those tasks seem to become more critical to meeting customer expectations. Some tasks are now performed by people who have to be trained to do those tasks or are done by people who have not done the task for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the simplest ways to make sure tasks can be performed simply and easily by a number of individuals is through workplace organization. This does not necessarily require new equipment, but rather the tools required to do the task are organized in such a way as to be easy to identify, obvious in their proper function in the process and noticeable if not returned to their proper place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organization is not only about the physical workplace. Done properly, it also organizes the mental approach to the task. There are many techniques used to accomplish this, from suspending the tools from above the workstation to shadow boards and foam inserts. The best solution is determined by the task and how the operator needs to access the tools. The point is to lay out the workstation in order to make it simpler for the operator and easier for him or her to perform the task properly (rather than improperly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the proper workplace organization, it becomes easier to do the task and easier to train new operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, one of the most popular approaches to workplace organization is 5-S. This approach was originally developed as a part of the body of knowledge now labeled as lean manufacturing. You can find out more about it in the book &amp;ldquo;Five Pillars of the Visual Workplace&amp;rdquo; by Hiroyuki Hirano. In English, the five steps are sort, straighten, standardize, shine/clean and sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/VjrFqMKsvaM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Improve Performance with a Storeroom Makeover</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever watched the TV show &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,&amp;rdquo; you may have gotten a little teary-eyed as the narrator tells the story of the family&amp;rsquo;s plight. Perhaps your eyes got a little misty again at the end of the show as the bus moves forward and everyone cheers when the family sees their new home filled with features they need to improve their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It would be understandable for managers or corporate leaders to get a little emotional when they realize the excess and waste in their maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) storeroom and operating practices. Reviewing the waste in a single storeroom can be chilling. If there are multiple storerooms, the investment and waste can be staggering. In a recent survey of Grainger Industrial Supply&amp;rsquo;s clients, respondents indicated that 73 percent of customers believe they have too much inventory, 87 percent see substantial cost-savings opportunities in their storeroom inventory &amp;ldquo;makeover&amp;rdquo; and 71 percent say they need to improve inventory management in their current storeroom operation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unlike the team on the &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover&amp;rdquo; show, we can&amp;rsquo;t just bulldoze the entire storeroom and start over. Many times the storeroom is the original facility that was put in place when the plant was built, including the original shelving and old pallet racks. Material handling equipment and storage systems have evolved many times through the years as have the inventory-management tools &amp;ndash; tools that provide real-time reports on inventory and part availability. Before material resource planning (MRP), barcoding options, radio frequency identification (RFID) capabilities and other computerized inventory-management systems, parts were tracked with data punch cards and microfiche viewers. Thankfully, data punch cards and microfiche viewers have gone the way of the typewriter, but we are still facing many of the same issues we faced before we had all these sophisticated tools.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Before a storeroom makeover can begin, we need to identify a starting point. A gap analysis assessment provides a snapshot of the current state of stores operation and identifies barriers and behaviors that are causing issues. As we analyze the data from the gap assessment, it becomes apparent that the barriers and behaviors we identified as problems are actually work-around solutions the floor-level employees have developed to compensate for undocumented or poorly designed work processes and undocumented changes to operating equipment. When the basic business processes for storeroom operation are abandoned, other areas of management begin to be ignored. Soon a storeroom can become dirty and accumulate materials stacked in the aisles, safety hazards created by improper storage practices, unmanaged obsolete inventory and inventory in excess of the maximum stocking level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementing a series of storeroom Kaizen projects based on the 5-S visual management system is a good starting point. Cleaning up the storeroom to identify what needs to stay and what needs to go will increase employee safety awareness and provide the shelf space needed to organize the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/a34ca377-86d2-453f-b2d9-496257c816c9_image 1.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 225px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;These photos show a Kaizen project that eliminated several safety hazards and increased storage efficiency through a small investment in new pallet racks and time for the storeroom employees to relocate the inventory in a more effective commodity grouping of items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adopting a practice of commodity grouping of the MRO inventory has several advantages over grouping of inventory by equipment asset. Commodity grouping of inventory items locates all bearings, motors and other like items together. The storeroom practice of grouping inventory items by equipment asset is a practice that was common before warehouse-management software was available to track inventory electronically. Unfortunately, this practice is still a common method of locating inventory in many MRO storerooms. The advantage of grouping spare parts inventories by equipment asset allowed the storeroom and maintenance employees to narrow their search to a specific area of the warehouse when they were searching for spare parts. The problem with asset grouping of spare parts is that it leads to duplicate inventory. If a bearing has several applications throughout the site, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that the bearing will be stocked in each equipment asset location.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Commodity grouping of the MRO inventory has a couple of obvious advantages. The greatest advantage of adopting commodity grouping of the MRO inventory is a reduction in inventory investment through elimination of duplicated inventory. A second benefit of commodity grouping of inventory is increased employee efficiency while stocking and picking inventory orders. Commodity grouping of inventory also allows for efficient execution of scheduled preventive maintenance (PM) for motors, large bearings, gearboxes and other items needing a prescribed care program while in the storeroom inventory.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When redesigning a storeroom, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider how available space is used to store inventory items. Many times storeroom managers feel they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough space to house all the inventory the site requires. Utilizing vertical space is the most overlooked option when the MRO storeroom is laid out. Understanding the volume of space available is critical to using all available space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When assessing space utilization in the storeroom, look at the spacing of pallet rack shelving and for opportunities to employ a rack system that incorporates hanging storage for hoses and items that can be stored vertically. Most of the time pallet racks are set on a standard spacing throughout the storeroom, which leads to wasted space in the majority of the pallet rack locations. High-density storage cabinets use existing space more effectively than the old metal shelving seen in many storerooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a general rule, installing high-density storage cabinets can reduce the footprint of metal shelving by 50 to 60 percent. Not only do you gain higher utilization of floor space and staff, but these cabinets also provide better protection from dust, dirt and exposure to other environmental contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/9bf73299-f1ab-408b-adb1-7fff6ea6008f_image 2.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 246px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;These before and after photos are of an area where high-density storage cabinets were used to eliminate wasted space and increase the protection of stored parts from environmental exposure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we get the new high-density storage cabinets, new pallet racks, new desks and chairs, we need to address the more daunting problem of having the right parts available when they are requested. As we dig into the root cause of the problem, we discover that the storeroom isn&amp;rsquo;t always the cause of not having the right part available for the needed equipment repair. Common issues faced by MRO storerooms today include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Out-of-date equipment bills of material (EBOM)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Critical and insurance spare parts not identified&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Undocumented work processes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High levels of obsolete inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High levels of excess inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storeroom is not secured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Undocumented inventory-management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High incidence of expedited purchases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Buying from non-certified suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A reactive maintenance culture that bypasses the storeroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are only a few of the issues that create waste in a storeroom operation. The two main areas that can be addressed by the storeroom are the undocumented work processes and inventory-management processes. For a total storeroom makeover to be successful, there are about a dozen best-practice work processes that need to be developed, implemented and executed. Each of these processes needs to be developed and owned by the storeroom staff:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establishing a prescribed way to perform each of the storeroom tasks removes variation in the work process and defines the responsible person who will perform each step. When developing work processes, it is important to streamline the activity to remove waste and mitigate bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the storeroom work processes are developed and implemented, it becomes clear that there are several touch points or hand-offs to other work processes within the business functions. The storeroom needs to establish documented partnerships and scheduled audits of the processes to ensure compliance. Partnerships between business units define expectations and delivered results to prevent waste in other areas of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a department partnership is an agreement between the storeroom and maintenance department that outlines the expectations of the storeroom to supply the needed repair parts and the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s understanding of its responsibility to the storeroom to support their efforts to meet these expectations. If each area of the business is operating as an island or a silo, it is difficult to identify issues that are creating waste in those business units. The result is a reactive business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conducting audits of the storeroom work processes identifies areas that are not being followed. As these areas of non-compliance in the work processes are identified, solutions to mitigate them can be implemented and the work processes revised to reflect the changes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just like the data entered in a computer, if the initial receiving process isn&amp;rsquo;t performed properly, getting the invoice paid on time and being able to find the part when it is requested is going to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first stop of a shipment upon entering a business is the receiving dock. Parcel shipments and palletized shipments are delivered by various carriers and require different types of equipment for unloading. Regardless of the means of delivery, the items should follow the same material flow through the receiving area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure a real-time inventory system, items need to be processed through the receiving process within 24 hours. To accomplish the expected flow of material through the receiving department, the area&amp;nbsp;should be organized and have a defined flow of material from staging area to staging area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using an inventory barcode system is an ideal way to remove several levels of waste in the receiving process and aid in the efficient management of the MRO inventory. Barcoding the inventory also tracks any movements of the inventory to ensure the location of the part is always current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/b2cecfb5-6721-4b5d-a579-114fc5b84034_image 3.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 255px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;This photo shows a receiving area that has undergone an extreme makeover. A little paint and a small investment in new equipment made this area a functional and ergonomically friendly workstation for the employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the item is entered into the warehouse inventory-management system, it should be managed to ensure it&amp;nbsp;is maintained in a service-ready condition. A repair part that is damaged due to poor storage practices or exposure to extreme environmental conditions doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same service life as an item that has been properly stored and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A defined cycle-count process is required to ensure the right parts are available when requested. The best-practice cycle-count process involves classifying inventory items by criticality and usage. Items identified as critical or insurance spares should be counted on a quarterly basis with the expectation that these items are 100-percent accurate all of the time. Items with high usage are the bulk of the inventory turns ratio and should be counted every six calendar months. High-usage items should have an expected cycle-count accuracy of 95 percent and compose about 80 percent of the total inventory value. Low-dollar items like nuts and bolts should be counted annually. Their expected accuracy level should be 90 percent. These low-dollar items are prime candidates for vendor-managed inventory where the items are in free-issue bins in the maintenance shops or close to the point of end use.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To monitor the performance of the storeroom and define a strategy to improve performance, the storeroom manager must have a set of key performance indicators that shows trends and deficiencies in the current performance. A matrix of key performance indicators that monitor both storeroom and storeroom employee performance would include the following set of metrics:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Storeroom Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Turns Ratio &amp;ndash; The best-practice MRO inventory turns ratio is three to four turns annually&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Value &amp;ndash; Best practice is 0.5 to 0.75 percent of the asset replacement value&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Issued &amp;ndash; Dollar value of inventory issued&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Received &amp;ndash; Dollar value of inventory received&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Transactions &amp;ndash; Indicates the utilization of storeroom employees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incidence of Inventory Stock Outs &amp;ndash; Best practice is less than 2 percent of total inventory requests&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identified Obsolete Inventory &amp;ndash; Expressed in dollars, the best practice is less than 5 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess Inventory &amp;ndash; Items over the maximum stocking level, expressed in dollars&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Accuracy &amp;ndash; Best practice is 95 percent overall inventory accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Adjustments &amp;ndash; From inventory cycle-count activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An extreme storeroom makeover is more of a journey than a one-time event. Many businesses spend thousands of dollars to make improvements to their storeroom, and then two to three years later they slide back into the old way of doing business. When this happens, the frustration level of management and employees can be even higher than before.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The easy part of this journey is implementing the changes; the hard part is executing and sustaining them. As you start any change project, remember that you are not only changing the way you do business, but you are also changing the expected behavior of your employees and the culture of your organization. In many cases, their jobs will change, and the changes could require skill upgrades to perform the revised jobs. These should not be viewed as barriers to making changes but as opportunities to develop your employees and improve the competitive position of the company. We need to &amp;ldquo;move that bus&amp;rdquo; and show everyone the new storeroom.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Reap the Benefits of Parts Standardization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nothing leverages your parts and training budgets like standardization. It is one of the key areas of the 5-S process. The more you can standardize, the fewer parts you need to maintain and the further your training goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some plants have dozens of manufacturers represented on their production floor with the subsequent glut of critical spares in the storeroom, shelves full of manuals and lost time while technicians re-familiarize themselves with troubleshooting procedures. It can also mean extra money spent on special tools, calibrators and handheld programmers, as well as maintaining extra vendors on file with the insurance, credit and shipping requirements that go with them. It takes some time and effort up front to establish standards, but the payoff can be continuous. The flavor of the month may be sexy and/or cheaper at the time of purchase, but you will probably pay for it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some simple guidelines to get you started. These are just a few places to look but may not be the place you want to start. Review your facility for problem areas and opportunities, then formulate your plan of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Check out your present equipment and look for commonalities like motors, variable frequency drives (VFDs), gearboxes, chains, sprockets, solenoid valves, PLCs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you are primarily a &amp;ldquo;one brand of PLC or VFD&amp;rdquo; plant, get your distributor to help you create a standard that leverages its stock. For example, if you use VFDs, consider standardizing on the largest horsepower-rated drive in each frame size. If the 30-, 40- and 50-horsepower models are the same frame, this range of drives can be consolidated into the 50-horsepower model. This means one spare in the storeroom instead of three. The cost savings can help compensate for the extra cost of the installed drives. Your distributor may only stock the largest horsepower size anyway and likely stocks it without a communication card. Follow his suit and leverage his stocking strategy for yourself. You also make emergency repairs faster and easier to manage, since the chances are good that you actually will have a spare available this way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEMA frame motors are dimensionally interchangeable, so look for the brands that work the best for you and consolidate your spares while specifying them for future installations. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work with manufacturers, but the old saying goes that you know you won&amp;rsquo;t get whatever you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for, so ask for it and see what the OEM says.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ISO dimension valves, solenoids, relays, etc., are also dimensionally interchangeable. Move this direction and you can use any ISO-compliant manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s product in a pinch.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shaft couplings can be of different types and brands, so look for opportunities to standardize on the brand and type that serves you best. The local stocking distributor can make a difference if it stocks what you use and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for a replacement element. Check into standardizing on sizes, too. If a unit can cover multiple horsepowers, it may be cheaper to use it on all of those horsepower applications rather than stock multiple spares. The time savings can be significant if the techs don&amp;rsquo;t have to search for the right element.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PLCs are a good place to save some parts money. If you can standardize on a brand and format, you leverage your spares and your training.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ANSI pumps are like NEMA motors in that the dimensions from flange to flange are the same. Where it gets complicated is the repair parts for the power-ends themselves. Different shafts, bearings, seals, etc., can add up fast. If you can move toward a single brand for similar applications, you can standardize on power-end assemblies and seals. If you use both stainless steel and carbon steel shafts, see if the stainless steel will work in both applications. The price difference is not as big as you might think. Having several variations of the same size seal means more spares and more opportunity for misapplication mistakes. See if you can use a higher-end seal (like hard surface vs. carbon surface) for more applications. While it will cost more initially, you will have fewer spares in the system and won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about a tech putting a low-end seal into your aggressive product pump.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that your procedures are a great place to save time and money. There are lots of procedures available out there from OEMs, vendors and organizations that can save you time. Like the old saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Why reinvent the wheel if someone else has already done it?&amp;rdquo; This can mean anything from a standard inspection procedure from the Internet to a product-specific repair or replacement procedure from the OEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like most journeys, it starts with the first step. Decide to make the journey and then dive into the available information stream for help. There are plenty of folks out there to help you, so ask your vendors, peers, techs and contacts for suggestions. Then, you can look at your plant and seek out the hidden opportunities. Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost &amp;mdash; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/JmcU81BhM4o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Brady to offer online training on lockout/tagout compliance, visual workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This week, Brady Corporation announced the debut of its new eLearning training program, a series of Web-based training courses on workplace safety and productivity. Brady launched the eLearning platform with two comprehensive training modules: a lockout/tagout compliance program and a visual workplace program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At $29.95 per course, the lockout/tagout and visual workplace eLearning programs offers employers an affordable and convenient solution to meet the growing need for employee training &amp;ndash; without the cost of travel and days off of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interactive training courses aid learning with real-life scenarios, quizzes and reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Brady&amp;rsquo;s eLearning courses offer a number of interactive features to facilitate learning and comprehension, including real-life application situations and on-the-spot quizzes. With graphics, flash animation and hundreds of photographs from actual facilities, the courses provide tangible examples that participants can relate to in their existing job responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Designed as a self-directed learning experience, the eLearning courses are available 24 hours a day via the internet. Participants can save their course progress and come back to complete the training at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For managers, the courses also feature a number of convenient reporting options for monitoring the training progress of their employees. Managers can assign courses, send reminder emails and generate progress reports all within the eLearning platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockout training module provides instruction for a safe and compliant lockout program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As a leader in lockout/tagout compliance devices and services, Brady launched the lockout training program to round out its complete offering of lockout/tagout solutions. The Lockout/Tagout eLearning module is a two-part training program for all employees involved in lockout/tagout activities in a facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first course is specifically designed for authorized and affected workers, which are the employees who will actually be performing the servicing and maintenance activities on de-energized equipment. It provides a comprehensive review of how to safely perform lockout activities in line with OSHA requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second course is intended for corporate safety leaders, or the employees responsible for managing the lockout program. It reviews key learnings from the first course, and trains participants on the proper requirements for developing, implementing and sustaining a safe and compliant lockout/tagout program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual Workplace modules train employees to use visuals to sustain lean improvements &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Visual Workplace eLearning program consists of three individual training modules, each designed for lean managers and their employees. With a module on visual workplace, 5-S workplace organization and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), the program provides a comprehensive review of visual workplace techniques and best practices, and teaches employees how to sustain lean improvements by incorporating visuals into their existing 5-S and TPM activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the first module, &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Visual Workplace,&amp;rdquo; employees learn the fundamental concepts of a visually-instructive workplace and learn how to identify, create and maintain visuals throughout a facility based on visual management tools and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second module, &amp;ldquo;5S Visuals &amp;ndash; Improving Workplace Organization,&amp;rdquo; provides an overview of 5-S workplace organization and how visuals are used in 5-S to maintain order and optimize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final module is entitled &amp;ldquo;Visual Controls for TPM &amp;ndash; Enhancing Equipment Reliability and Maintenance Efficiency.&amp;rdquo; This course reviews the methods and goals of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and demonstrates how to use visuals in TPM to simplify maintenance and detect abnormalities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Purdue to offer lean manufacturing, Six Sigma training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Purdue University again in 2011 will offer training in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma practices for which professionals can earn certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The courses, sponsored by the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, part of Purdue&amp;#39;s Technical Assistance Program, are for those currently working and for displaced professionals. Those who are unemployed may be eligible for training funds to pay for some of the courses and should check with their local WorkOne office for eligibility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Six Sigma Green Belt and Six Sigma Black Belt courses combine a detailed roadmap with statistical tools to resolve critical business issues. These are recommended for owners or management teams, engineers or technical staff from small to medium-sized companies. Participants should have some knowledge of basic statistics.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Green Belts typically work in teams to implement improvements. Black Belts independently apply more sophisticated tools to guide improvements throughout a business or organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Advanced Manufacturing (Lean) Practitioner training focuses on waste removal from production or office processes. It covers principles of lean manufacturing, the 5-S visual workplace, principles of stream mapping, quick changeover/setup reduction and total productive maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Training will be held in Evansville, Fort Wayne and Indianapolis. Course specifics and registration information are available at mep.purdue.edu/events. Displaced professionals seeking to apply for training funds should print course brochures from the website and take them to WorkOne for review.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center provides technical skills development and implementation services to manufacturers who want to increase productivity and profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, and advance work-force skills. Areas of expertise include advanced manufacturing processes, lean implementation, quality management systems, Six Sigma, green enterprise development and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/1D56LiE31gA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Thoughts and considerations on 5-S implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	While&amp;nbsp;value stream mapping (VSM) and kaizen events are often the most&amp;nbsp;misused of the lean tools,&amp;nbsp;5-S is the most misunderstood&amp;nbsp;lean tool.&amp;nbsp;Here are some 5-S thoughts and considerations to review.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Common 5-S issues and mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The 5-S&amp;rsquo;s are about creating a safe, clean and organized work environment which eliminates waste including losses due to unsafe work conditions &amp;ndash; there is no sixth S for safety.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Successful lean implementations occur in organizations where the management team demonstrates leadership. This means&amp;nbsp;starting 5-S in the office first,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;at least implementing&amp;nbsp;it simultaneously in the office and factory.&amp;nbsp;There are organizations that say they have been doing lean for years yet have never applied it to the office. These organizations then wonder why they are showing &amp;ldquo;little or no progress&amp;rdquo; with their lean implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Demonstrating leadership also means managers and supervisors never &amp;ldquo;just walk by&amp;rdquo; an unsafe or dirty condition.&amp;nbsp;This leadership&amp;nbsp;helps develop a lean culture&amp;nbsp;where no one in the organization would knowingly walk&amp;nbsp;by an unsafe or dirty work condition. This lean culture is the foundation of world-class organizations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations&amp;nbsp;generally require their&amp;nbsp;factory associates to&amp;nbsp;clean&amp;nbsp;up their areas during or at the end of their shift. Yet, in the same organization, a third party is brought in or used to clean up the offices of the administrative associates.&amp;nbsp;If we want teamwork,&amp;nbsp;we need one set of rules.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The 5-S red tagging event is a &amp;ldquo;one-time&amp;rdquo; activity, not an annual activity that allows us to make excuses for what our area looks like during the year.&amp;nbsp;If our people are properly trained in 5-S, they will protect &amp;ldquo;their area&amp;rdquo; from things that do not belong there and move things to the &amp;ldquo;5-S parking lot&amp;rdquo; when they are no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The third S, sweep or shine, also means that we will develop ways to prevent things from getting dirty. It is&amp;nbsp;not just a matter of cleaning up every day. What can we do to prevent things from getting dirty so clean up is not required?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When 5-S fails, it fails because we did not properly implement the fourth S (schedule/standardize) and there was no follow-up&amp;nbsp;using the fifth S (sustain).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you want everyone to clean up, make sure everyone has his or her own cleaning supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, the&amp;nbsp;business will develop its own 5-S expertise&amp;nbsp;when new&amp;nbsp;5-S safety, organizing methods,&amp;nbsp;clean-up techniques&amp;nbsp;and other 5-S methods&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;established. Audit procedures and scoring should be adjusted to these developments, thus&amp;nbsp;raising the bar to the new baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One of the required measures for the success of your 5-S implementation includes never having to clean up in advance&amp;nbsp;of customer or other special company visitors.&amp;nbsp;Think about it: When we tell our associates they must&amp;nbsp;&amp;rdquo;clean up&amp;rdquo; in advance of a visitor, what are&amp;nbsp;we telling them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Pharmanex succeeds with 6S Quality Process</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Nu Skin and Pharmanex uses proprietary technology in its manufacturing processes to maintain tight quality controls through all stages of product development. The key to consistent quality is the Pharmanex 6S Quality Process, the basis of the company&amp;#39;s pharmaceutical approach to product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Recommendations and suggestions for 5-S auditing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The fifth&amp;nbsp;component of 5-S, Sustain,&amp;nbsp;is all about developing the discipline to use and maintain&amp;nbsp;the 5-S system on a daily basis everywhere within the organization.&amp;nbsp;Sustain means understanding how 5-S eliminates organizational waste and then making the&amp;nbsp;first four S&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;a habit and part of the company&amp;rsquo;s culture.&amp;nbsp;Sustain, for most organizations (even after the&amp;nbsp;5-S training&amp;nbsp;and 5-S kaizen events),&amp;nbsp;means 5-S audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are some recommendations and suggestions on 5-S&amp;nbsp;auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Audit scores range from 0.0 to 5.0. We&amp;nbsp;use scores in tenths.&amp;nbsp;More on this below.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		First, understand that audits,&amp;nbsp;like third-party inspection, are wasteful activities.&amp;nbsp;Like product or service quality, 5-S is an activity that we and the customer expect to pay one person to do it right the first time.&amp;nbsp;Audits do serve the short-term purpose&amp;nbsp;of both the reinforcement of the new process we are implementing (necessary if your organizations have had many&amp;nbsp;&amp;rdquo;programs of the month&amp;rdquo;) and&amp;nbsp;advanced 5-S training activities (How do&amp;nbsp;we achieve a score of a &amp;ldquo;5.0&amp;rdquo; on an audit of our work area?).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The audit team&amp;nbsp;should consist of both factory and office associates, an hourly and salary mix.&amp;nbsp;General guidelines are four to six auditors (not including the lean facilitator,&amp;nbsp;per 250-person organization). The audit team should do practice audits&amp;nbsp;to get everyone on the same page and develop a baseline.&amp;nbsp;Also, consider how government&amp;nbsp;regulations&amp;nbsp;can set baseline scores. For example, if your organization produces food or medical&amp;nbsp;products, meeting&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;FDA&amp;nbsp;workplace requirements might mean that the minimum 5-S&amp;nbsp;score for the first four S&amp;rsquo;s is a 3.0. Scores less than 3.0 might mean the FDA requirements are not being met.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, audits should occur&amp;nbsp;at least every two weeks.&amp;nbsp;Remember, it is both process reinforcement and a learning experience. As the average audit score climbs,&amp;nbsp;the audit time span can be increased. The organization should determine what the operational criteria&amp;nbsp;will be for eliminating audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5-S job instructions (the fourth S) and audit areas should be established by natural work groups and teams in both manufacturing and the office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is suggested that 5-S office guidelines be developed for each organization. Office areas, unlike manufacturing areas, can be categorized into basically one group.&amp;nbsp;The organization should create common 5-S job instructions (part of the fourth S)&amp;nbsp;that define the organization&amp;rsquo;s office 5-S expectations. Some examples are shown below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/10/15/quick/ab0cb066-7ab7-4f7a-9c23-a0904ae413e3_rubrich400.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 341px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S scoring guideline sheet is shown below for the first three S&amp;rsquo;s (Electronic copies of all 5-S guidelines, scoring, and grading charts are available upon request at &lt;a href="mailto:kelly@wcmfg.com" target="_blank"&gt;kelly@wcmfg.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich401.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It should be noted that there are special 5-S audit circumstances for safety violations.&amp;nbsp;First,&amp;nbsp;the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;that the&amp;nbsp;safety violation is covered by gets a score of &amp;ldquo;zero.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;Typically, these are second S violations.&amp;nbsp;The audit team&amp;nbsp;must immediately notify&amp;nbsp;the responsible supervisor and the&amp;nbsp;safety violation must be corrected immediately.&amp;nbsp;The audit must confirm the correction (the score does not change after correction).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S grading sheet is shown below. Note that as important as the&amp;nbsp;score is,&amp;nbsp;comments on what needs to improved upon to achieve a score of 5.0 also&amp;nbsp;must be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich402.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, we believe audit scores should be posted (high to low) in a very visible area of the organization so everyone can see how the organization is doing. The high scores and&amp;nbsp;the 5-S activities, in general, should&amp;nbsp;be one topic in the organization&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;monthly&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;all hands&amp;rdquo; meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, the&amp;nbsp;business will develop its own 5-S expertise&amp;nbsp;when new&amp;nbsp;5-S safety, organizing methods,&amp;nbsp;clean-up techniques&amp;nbsp;and other 5-S methods&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;established. Audit procedures and scoring should be adjusted to these developments, thus&amp;nbsp;raising the bar to the new baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the required measures for the success of your audits and 5-S implementation&amp;nbsp;in general&amp;nbsp;includes never having to clean up in advance&amp;nbsp;of customer or other special company visitors. Always being&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;tour&amp;rdquo; or&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;visit&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;ready is an important 5-S measure.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Show me the results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One cultural aspect of American business that is both a driving force and a curse is our obsession with getting results. It does not matter if we are looking at company performance or individual performance. It does not matter if we are looking at strategy, marketing, sales, manufacturing or finance. Neither does it matter if we look at our lean progress or any other business approach, our business metrics or our stock performance. The bottom line is that everything and everyone is rated and evaluated on results and only on results.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just as in sports, all that matters is the final score &amp;ndash; who won. What do we see in the majority of sports headlines &amp;hellip; who won, who lost and the score.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For most of us, this is just a fact of life, a given, part of our competitive nature, our culture. I cannot argue against results entirely; results are important.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Sometimes we can easily quantify the results by making them objective. Sometime we cannot. Results that are subjective are like beauty &amp;ndash; it is in the eye of the beholder. Despite our efforts to make all results objective and quantifiable, in many cases, subjectivity remains.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Overlooking this problem, we obsess over results. What is our stock price? What were our quarterly financials? Did I hit my quota? What is our 5-S audit score? What is our overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)? What are my direct labor costs? Was this project a success? What is each employee&amp;rsquo;s talent matrix rating? Just tell me the score.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But does this tell us the whole story? Are we focused long-term? Does it reflect the struggle? What about the knowledge gained? Does it matter? What impact will it have on our future? What was the cost of our success? Were there any negative consequences in getting our results? Do we care?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In our obsession with results, do we actually miss something, perhaps something greater?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Storage products company practices what it preaches</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems fitting that a company that provides storage and workplace solutions for business and industry &amp;ndash; and whose motto is &amp;ldquo;making workspace work&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; should embark on an innovative lean manufacturing program to drive waste out of its own manufacturing processes, resulting in top-quality, competitively priced products, delivered in the shortest time possible. And it is even more fitting that the company would turn to its own products to make the move to lean an especially successful one.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our goal as an organization is to delight the customer with all aspects of our products and service,&amp;rdquo; says Peter Lariviere, president of Lista International Corporation. &amp;ldquo;We achieve this through the elimination of costly waste and the implementation of standard work throughout every aspect of the organization, from quoting an order to receipt of payment. Our goal is to provide our customers with moments of excellence throughout our value stream. We strive to be best in industry, in terms of quality, breadth and flexibility of product line, and lead time. Integrating the use of Lista products into our processes has resulted in significant progress in achieving our objectives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista International, an ISO 9001 certified company, is one of North America&amp;rsquo;s leading manufacturers of storage and workspace systems. Established in 1968 in Holliston, Mass., the corporate headquarters houses a 225,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, as well as design and engineering offices. Lista North America is part of Swiss-based Lista Group, a leader in the manufacture of modular drawer storage systems, workbenches and storage solutions for a wide range of markets and applications. Lista Group employs more than 600 people worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lean Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista&amp;rsquo;s goal is to use lean manufacturing concepts to provide customers a broader, improved offering of high-quality, custom-configured products with the shortest turnaround time in the industry. Lista&amp;rsquo;s emphasis is on driving out complexity to create a highly flexible manufacturing environment. The results are impressive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The foundation for the lean program began with material flow and process flow improvements made about four years ago. In the last year, Lista has really turned the corner and has steadily reduced its turnaround time from more than two weeks to as little as two to four business days for many popular products. Along the way, they&amp;rsquo;ve moved work centers close together, eliminated travel in the process line, and significantly eliminated waste throughout their delivery system. The company has been able to reduce its inventory by more than 35 percent, while at the same time reducing lead times and improving customer service. Overall, Lista has realized greatly increased productivity and efficiency, and reduced its requirements for floor space.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We made fundamental changes in the order and delivery system and the manner in which we drive customer orders through our production process with demand replenishment concepts and principles. Kanban is a major component of our manufacturing process, and Lista products are ideal for the application of the kanban systems,&amp;rdquo; said Lariviere. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always had fully customizable solutions in our standard two-week delivery program, and now we have customizable products in our Lista Xpress two- to four-day turnaround express delivery program. Lean manufacturing allows us to extend our capabilities &amp;ndash; to expand what we can provide to customers in the shortest lead time possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lean Manufacturing Toolkit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lean manufacturing uses a set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste. Among the ones Lista uses are value stream mapping, the 5-S workplace organization and housekeeping system (sort, set in place, shine, standardize, sustain), and a kanban order and inventory withdrawal system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are always looking internally to reduce non-value added process and movement time,&amp;rdquo; said Aaron Tessitore, director of operations, who says that lean methods enabled the Xpress delivery offering to consist of configured, built-to-order products rather than off-the-shelf stocked products. &amp;ldquo;Lista shares the same types of concerns as its customers, such as reducing inventory, consolidating facilities, minimizing floor space, and increasing cash flow. A welcome by-product has been waste elimination and cost reduction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storage Company, Store Thyself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the interesting features about this particular lean manufacturing process is that Lista uses its own product line to help implement the results of the value stream mapping, the 5-S and the kanban setup. Lista products are now totally integrated into its manufacturing process.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When you think about it,&amp;rdquo; says John Grover, director of lean manufacturing, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s like the reverse of the old saying that the cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children have no shoes. In our case, as an industrial storage company, we had access to a product line that helped us implement waste elimination through space reduction, organization improvement and inventory management. Lista storage cabinets and workbench products are designed to allow dense storage and a smaller footprint. From a material flow standpoint, the Lista flexible workbench line and modular tables made it very easy to add flexibility to the production lines that facilitated faster turnaround time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In fact, Lista has long been a solutions provider for lean manufacturers, whether the company needs high-density storage or a highly flexible line of workbench products. The 5-S principles are a capsule description of the leading features of the company&amp;rsquo;s products: highly organized (sort), ideal for tracking inventory (set in place), aesthetically pleasing and easily kept clean (shine), modular in design (standardize) and scalable (sustain).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The system is set up so everything has a place that is available when needed, from the finished goods area where products are being packaged, through the equipment maintenance area. Everything is labeled and identified using Lista&amp;rsquo;s built-in labeling and identification features, making a 5-S system that is very flexible for whatever the organizational needs may be. Local storage minimizes travel time, and adjustable storage and workbenches make it easier to adapt to the differing needs of individual employees.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lean Manufacturing Benefits Customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Although lean is sometimes thought of as the ultimate cost-cutting program, Lista&amp;rsquo;s program focused more on customer benefits. &amp;ldquo;All the work we did in our program took aim at compressing the cycle time, which gives our customers added flexibility and minimizes the lead time for our product line, which gives us a competitive advantage in the market,&amp;rdquo; said Tessitore.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The company is also able to roll out an improved Xpress delivery program offering, with a much more flexible and configurable product, all with a two- to four-day shipping time. Before, because Xpress program products were pre-built and stocked in a warehouse, it was not possible to change anything about an Xpress product to respond to a specific need. The new lean process gives Lista more flexibility in delivering virtually the same turnaround with a much more customizable product that is exactly what the customer wants, not just &amp;ldquo;pretty much&amp;rdquo; what the customer wants.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Higher quality is also a result of this effort. Fewer components are being made on a job-by-job basis and there are fewer components to deal with during final assembly. This significantly reduces the potential for short shipments and/or mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value Stream Mapping &amp;ndash; Driving Waste out of Delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista used value stream mapping to analyze the material, process and information flow used to drive customer requirements and satisfaction goals across the organization. The information was used to develop a current state map, which sets out how things were done. The firm then used a cross-functional team to analyze the current state map to identify opportunities for waste elimination. Finally, the team envisioned a future state based on the exercise. Lista employees at all levels were deeply involved in the value stream mapping and remain involved in the implementation, which gives the organization access to the best thinking and input.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista then began work on implementing the future state. The process is iterative; the future state becomes the current state, and Lista uses a continuous improvement process to go back and identify new ways to reduce waste. Waste is defined very broadly, and includes things like waste in the movement of material, carrying too much inventory, defects or rework, or producing scrap.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One concrete outcome was the elimination of the need for the company&amp;rsquo;s 17,000-square-foot finished goods inventory warehouse. Since moving toward a build-to-order Xpress system, Lista no longer needs to stock finished goods and has been able to eliminate the warehouse requirement.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kanban &amp;ndash; Stocking/Replenishing System Cuts Overstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another key step that drove turnaround times down to the two- to four-day shipping window for Xpress products was the institution of a kanban system, an inventory replenishment system for just-in-time production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The system calls for a careful analysis of the manufacturing process, which determined that fabrication of the steel parts prior to being powder coated took the greatest amount of time. Rather than basing manufacturing on customer orders, the new kanban system is directed by usage models, which ensures that just enough stock is ready to paint and assemble to fulfill customer orders. This means Lista no longer has to keep finished goods inventory in stock, but always has material ready to paint and assemble to order.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista&amp;rsquo;s kanban system uses a visual board set up with all the parts listed for a particular work center. Signals are loaded based on consumption, and the operator can see the rate at which parts are being consumed. The entire manufacturing activities are the result of a visual-based demand replenishment system. Operators can see how fast the parts they manufacture are being consumed and can react quickly and decisively to ensure customer requirements are met. The system empowers employees, and allows them to fulfill needs in real time, rather than making products in a sequence which is based on paper-intensive material requirements planning (MRP) documents.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The kanban system is used to streamline production for Lista&amp;rsquo;s high-volume, repetitive-demand products, primarily the company&amp;rsquo;s most popular workbenches and cabinets. This is about 80 to 85 percent of the company&amp;rsquo;s output.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a shift in a way of looking at the process,&amp;rdquo; says Grover. &amp;ldquo;This is what is meant by lean &amp;ndash; not just eliminating waste in the process, but doing things that are required to add value to the customers, at the lowest cost point in the process and earliest phases. Lean manufacturing pulls all these pieces together, giving you the toolkit, mind-set and the methodology to keep working at a continuous improvement process in an extremely effective manner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/RPZEeFtIocU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Supplier relationships in a lean enterprise</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The traditional purchasing model has buyers and suppliers as adversaries â¦ or at least competitors. The supplier is trying to bid just low enough to get a contract while the buyer is looking for the lowest price. The buyer continually is applying pressure to the supplier, and the supplier has no way to meet the buyerâs demands without sacrificing something. Ultimately, at least one of the organizations loses. However, the lean buyer-supplier model is one of cooperation. The buyer and supplier are partners. If the buyer succeeds, the supplier succeeds. What does such a relationship look like?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Entering an outsourcing relationship must create value for both the supplier and buyer. To accomplish this, it is important that the supplier be given the tools and incentives to succeed. &amp;nbsp;First of all, âopen bookâ or transparent costing must be in place. That is, the buyer should be able to know how much it costs the supplier to produce components. The buyerâs goal is no longer to maximize its own profits and minimize the profits of the supplier. Instead, both organizations must work toward increasing total value.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An outsourcing contract need not specify the pricing on each item that the supplier will provide; it should specify the method by which prices will be determined. The buyer and supplier need to gain agreement on pricing. Initial pricing can be based on supplier cost plus a reasonable percentage for profit. Generally speaking, pricing on existing products should be expected to decrease. The buyer must challenge the supplier to decrease pricing through productivity improvements, and some form of gain-sharing should be specified. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The buyer must ensure that the supplier has the tools to accomplish such improvements. A lean organization must help its suppliers get lean by assisting them in activities such as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Value stream mapping training and implementation 
&lt;LI&gt;5-S training and implementation 
&lt;LI&gt;Kaizen events focused on cellular manufacturing/one-piece flow, TPM, quick changeover and other basic lean tools 
&lt;LI&gt;Setting up kanban systems &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If an organization makes such investments in its suppliers, it will build an environment of trust and will create the necessary conditions for its suppliers to succeed. If an organizationâs suppliers are successful, its supply chains will be successful: overall lead time, inventory and costs will decrease. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>5-S, lean activities and leading by example</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;âPreach the gospel at all times; only if necessary use words.â&lt;BR&gt;- Saint Francis of Assisi&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not what we say, it is what we do. Leading by example is a powerful method for success on our lean journey and in life â probably our most powerful. It removes doubt, builds trust and strengthens our message. It helps others to better understand and inspires action. It even helps us gain a deeper understanding. It shows what is important.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you guess who is shown in the picture above? This is the president of a company in Japan participating in the siteâs daily 5-S activities. Each morning, the entire salaried management team works side by side to clean and organize the plant. From washing floors and trimming hedges to cleaning bathrooms, no task is left undone.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=345 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_5SLean_clip_image002.jpg" width=460&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5-S, lean activities and leading by example&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;What kind of message do you think the presidentâs actions send to his employees?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The simple truth is that you donât have to be a CEO or president to lead by example. Every day, each of us has the opportunity to lead by example, and it is our choice to take advantage of this opportunity or let it pass us by.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach 5-S and yet our own desks are disorganized and piled high in clutter?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach daily continuous improvement and yet we donât want to change how we do our own tasks?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach standard work and yet we avoid creating or following any standard work in our daily tasks?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach elimination of all waste and yet we canât imagine giving up our one-sided, color paper copies of our monthly policy deployment even though we have access to the digital copy?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach establishing a no-blame environment and yet, when there is an error made, the first question out of our mouths is âDid you write the employee up?â&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach about the benefit of using outside eyes and yet we donât want any outsiders (especially corporate) messing around in our area to look for improvement opportunities?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we preach âmake all problems visibleâ and yet we kill the messenger of any bad news or hide problems from others?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we just talk about the lean philosophy or are we trying to live the lean philosophy?&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How to sustain your 5-S program</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Many organizations make some early 5-S improvements and then slide back into their old ways of doing things. Other organizations continue to maintain their 5-S programs for many years. What separates a successful 5-S program from one that is headed for failure? An unsuccessful implementation of 5-S was never a complete 5-S implementation. The fifth âSâ stands for âsustain;â if implemented completely, a 5-S program will have longevity. There are three keys to successfully sustaining 5-S: commitment, top management support and performance measurement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key No. 1: Commitment.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The first key is to commit to all five Sâs. While this may appear to be obvious, I once had a conversation with a well-meaning executive who told me: âWe are just going to implement 3-S for now. We arenât ready for all five.â The fifth S, âshitsukeâ in Japanese, actually translates more closely to âcommitmentâ than âsustain.â According to Tomo Sugiyama (author of The Improvement Book), âshitsukeâ is a typical teaching and attitude toward any undertaking to inspire pride and adherence to the standards established.â If your entire organization is not committed to 5-S, your organizationâs 5-S program will be short-lived. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key No. 2: Top Management Support.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The first and second keys go hand-in-hand. Commitment is not possible without top managementâs visible support for the program. All employees must believe that the organization has committed to the program. One way to encourage top management to get involved on a continuing basis is for them to conduct quarterly 5-S visits in which executives inspect each work area to 5-S conditions and offer advice and support to the employees. Another effective method for demonstrating top management support is for executives to mandate and participate in visible promotion of 5-S. Some ways to promote 5-S include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Designated 5-S days: Select a day per month or per quarter to emphasize 5-S throughout the plant. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Slogans: Select a 5-S related slogan, post it in public areas throughout the plant, pass out shirts made up with the slogan to successful 5-S teams, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Public announcements: In monthly or quarterly announcements/all-employee meetings, take some time to emphasize the importance of 5-S. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Seminars: Have employees participate in seminars throughout the year. Some of these should be 5-S related. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key No. 3: Performance Measurement and Reward System.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The third key is to measure 5-S performance in each work area and set up a reward system to reward teams that achieve 5-S success. Organizations that have successful 5-S programs measure their performance through weekly audits using checklists and score sheets. Results of the audits are posted in public areas. This creates an atmosphere of friendly competition and will help to instill pride in the teams youâve set up. This measurement and competition should be combined with a reward system; most successful organizations offer monthly or quarterly rewards for their teams in various 5-S categories. The rewards can range from movie tickets to cash bonuses. &lt;BR&gt;These three keys are simple but powerful. Your organization must commit to all five of the five pillars. Top management must show visible support for the program. And, your organization must set up a 5-S performance measurement and reward system. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About the author:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Darren Dolcemascolo is an internationally recognized lecturer, author and consultant.

            <title>Sustain the gains of lean improvements</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;If your company uses lean practices to improve plant operations and business performance, or if youâre considering a lean transformation, youâre not alone. In recent years, more companies have adopted lean as a continuous improvement method to improve profitability, enhance customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Within lean practices is a growing concept called âvisual workplace,â also known as visual factory or visual management, and itâs a critical part of any lean initiative. Visual workplace helps sustain lean operations by using visual tools to ensure that improvements remain clearly visible, readily understood and consistently adhered to long after the lean event is over.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Opportunities to Reduce Waste&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Businesses are often surprised to learn that only a small fraction of their activities actually add value for their customers. In a lean workplace, âwasteâ is any activity that adds no value for a customer. Itâs not uncommon that 50 percent or more of a facilityâs activities are considered waste.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A primary cause of waste is information deficits â employees simply lack the knowledge they need to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. They may not fully understand their priorities or deadlines, nor the proper way to perform tasks. This leads employees to waste valuable time and motion searching, asking, waiting, retrieving, reworking or just plain giving up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A visual workplace is self-explanatory: It displays information thatâs visible at a glance and at the point of use, eliminates questions and ensures that best practices are followed. By clearly displaying information such as instructions, warnings, standards and other critical operations knowledge, visual tools help to properly guide employee actions. These tools also make it easier to detect abnormalities in products, equipment and processes, and provide workers with real-time feedback on where they stand against goals and expectations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Gwendolyn Galsworth, Ph.D. and author of âVisual Workplace, Visual Thinkingâ, an effective implementation of visual systems at client companies has resulted in the following dramatic improvements:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;15 percent increase in throughput 
&lt;LI&gt;70 percent cut in materials handling 
&lt;LI&gt;60 percent decrease in floor space 
&lt;LI&gt;80 percent decrease in flow distance 
&lt;LI&gt;68 percent reduction in rack storage 
&lt;LI&gt;50 percent decrease in annual physical inventory time 
&lt;LI&gt;96 percent decrease in defects &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clearly, visual workplace plays a key role in creating the empowered, creative and aligned work culture that is the end goal of any lean transformation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Visuality Encompasses All Lean Concepts&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Visual workplace techniques represent a critical component of lean concepts, including 5-S, standard work, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), just-in-time (JIT) inventory management and kanban-based pull production. Here are some ideas on how visual devices can be put to profitable use in your lean initiatives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5-S workplace organization: &lt;/STRONG&gt;This technique focuses on sorting, cleaning and organizing to set the foundation for a stable work environment. Visual devices help maintain long-term visual order by clearly identifying aisles, storage areas and locations for equipment, tools, parts and products. Visuals such as bin markers, floor marking tapes, shadow boards and tool ID labels ensure that items are consistently returned to their proper place, eliminating wasted search and retrieval time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=187 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image002.gif" width=189&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=189 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image004.gif" width=190&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=189 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image006.gif" width=191&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standard work and quick changeover: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Visual tools ensure that workers readily understand proper setup, operating and inspection procedures. Instead of just storing information in binders and computer drives, post critical information clearly right at the point of use. In mixed work environments, use color-coding to identify the proper parts and tools for the job at hand. Youâll simplify training, prevent mistakes, reduce cycle times and improve safety.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=193 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image008.gif" width=195&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Total Productive Maintenance: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Identifying abnormalities at a glance is a key objective of TPM. Once equipment has been center-lined, visual devices such as multi-color gauge labels and oil level indicators can clearly indicate when operating conditions are out of spec. Visual devices also help machine operators perform autonomous maintenance tasks by clearly identifying preventive maintenance (PM) points and indicating the correct use of grease and lubricants.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=186 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image010.gif" width=261&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=186 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image012.gif" width=188&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JIT and kanban: &lt;/STRONG&gt;A key goal of lean is to eliminate excess inventory. The concepts of just-in-time inventory management and kanban-based pull production help achieve these goals by ensuring that product is produced only in the time and amount needed. Visual reorder indicators control stocking levels for inventory, and kanban cards are used to prevent excess production.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=191 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image014.gif" width=193&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=191 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image016.gif" width=193&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=191 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image018.gif" width=189&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lean metrics and management: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Open communication is a hallmark of a lean business. Employees need to know what is expected of them and how theyâre performing. Visual displays such as scoreboards, scheduling charts, team communication boards and recognition displays all help to keep information flowing between employees, work, departments and upper management.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=155 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image020.gif" width=216&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=224 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image022.gif" width=149&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;IMG height=160 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Sustain_clip_image024.gif" width=234&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Make Your Own Visuals&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The right printing system can be an essential tool for creating a visual workplace, allowing you to make signs, labels, tags and more on demand. Two printers popular among lean and visual workplace practitioners include Bradyâs versatile benchtop GlobalMark printer and the portable HandiMark printer. Some of their benefits include:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simple and fast: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Eliminate cutting, drawing and preparing visual devices by hand. Visuals are quickly and easily designed on computer, then printed and automatically cut to size. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Print on demand&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; No time wasted placing orders or waiting for visuals to be delivered from outside vendors. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Economical&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Create customized visuals for significantly less than those produced at sign shops or commercial printers. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Professional: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Create sign-shop-quality visuals that are easy to read at a glance. Eliminate amateurish drawings and hard-to-read handwriting. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Durable: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Brady thermal transfer printers provide better abrasion, moisture, chemical and UV resistance than inkjet or laser printing. Moreover, visuals stick and stay stuck to even curved and textured surfaces like pipes, walls and floors. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standardized&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;: &lt;/STRONG&gt;User-customizable templates promote consistency and ensure that visual devices used by different groups and sites have the same look and formatting. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Colorful&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Multiple color capability adds impact and clarity to visual markers. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whichever lean tools you use, visual thinking can reinforce and sustain improvements throughout your plant. Thereâs much to be gained by creating a workplace where employees are guided by visual information that tells them at a glance what to do, how to do it properly, and where to quickly find what they need. The accompanying boost in productivity, quality, capacity, on-time delivery and equipment reliability will make your facility leaner than ever.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Understanding overall equipment effectiveness</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a concept utilized in a lean manufacturing implementation. OEE is becoming a commonly utilized maintenance metric within lean organizations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="http://www.1stcourses.com/"&gt;OEE&lt;/A&gt; concept normally measures the effectiveness of a machine center or process line, but can be utilized in non-manufacturing operations, also.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The high-level formula for the lean manufacturing OEE is:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE = Availability X Productivity X Quality. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Abbreviated, it is OEE = A X P X Q.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âAvailabilityâ portion of the equation measures the percentage of time the equipment or operation was running compared to the available time. For example, if a machine was available to run 16 hours but was only run for 12, then the âAvailabilityâ is 75 percent (12/16). The four hours when the machine didnât run would be setup time, breakdown or other down time. The eight hours the company did not plan to run the machine is rarely used in the calculation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âPerformanceâ portion of the equation measures the running speed of the operation compared to its maximum capability, often called the rated speed. For example, if a machine produced 70 pieces per hour while running but the capability of the machine is 100, then the âPerformanceâ is 70 percent (70/100). The concept can be used multiple ways depending on the capability number. For example, the machine might be capable of producing 100 pieces per hour with the perfect part, but only 90 on that particular order. When the capability of 100 is used for the calculation, the result is more a measure of facility OEE. For example, the sales department may take an order for a part than can only be produced at 90 per hour, which negatively affects OEE.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âQualityâ portion of the equation measures the number of good parts produced compared to the total number of parts made. For example, if 100 parts are made and 90 of them are good, the âQualityâ is 90 percent (90/100).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Combining the above example into the OEE equation, the OEE is:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE = 75% X 70% X 90% = 47.25%&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As you can see, an OEE of 100 percent would require a machine to produce good quality every second of the available time at its top rated speed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key to using OEE is in the analysis. For example, if the âAvailabilityâ is 70 percent, the 30 percent of time for breakdowns, setup and downtime should be analyzed for improvement opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The most effective use of OEE is to break down the losses into smaller buckets of âopportunityâ. A 50 percent OEE doesnât mean much without any detail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The OEE goal depends on the process, setup times and order quantities. For example, a machine that produces 10 orders per day with a 30-minute setup time would have 300 minutes reduced from the Availability equation. Conversely, a machine that runs one order all day would only have 30 minutes of setup time. These facts make it difficult to compare two machinesâ OEE numbers. The value is in the analysis and comparison of a machineâs OEE in one period vs. another. The comparison may also become meaningless if the order quantities vary significantly day to day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Knowing the complete OEE breakdown, the opportunities for improvement become apparent. The largest opportunities should be improved first, working down the list until all opportunities are improved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The improvement opportunities are always in one of the following âbucketsâ.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Breakdown 
&lt;LI&gt;Setup 
&lt;LI&gt;Downtime 
&lt;LI&gt;Speed loss 
&lt;LI&gt;Small stops 
&lt;LI&gt;Quality &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE is an excellent way of communicating the improvement opportunities to everyone, including operators, maintenance technicians, sales representatives, engineers and managers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most lean manufacturing tools work together to create value in the system and eliminate âwasteâ. OEE is a prime example of this integration of tools.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many lean implementations begin with a concept called â5-Sâ and value stream mapping. The value stream map shows where the waste occurs in the system. OEE analysis can be applied at the point where the waste occurs. The improvement in the OEE number will take the use of other lean applications, such as SMED (setup reduction), TPM (Total Productive Maintenance), standardized operations and âkaizen eventsâ targeting specific areas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is important in a lean manufacturing implementation to use the correct tools at the right time. Many lean implementations have failed because organizations failed to grasp a deep understanding of all lean concepts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tools should be âpickedâ based on the opportunities in the organization, rather than âfitâ into the organization. When an organization forces tools that donât apply, it creates chaos and credibility problems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE is a powerful lean manufacturing tool, especially when combined with other tools using an integrated approach. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How plant reliability affects a lean implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;As a plant manager for the past seven years, I had a unique opportunity to lead a lean manufacturing implementation in two separate facilities. The plants were similar in numerous ways. They were both building-products manufacturing facilities, both were continuous processes, both had roughly 300 hourly people, and they were both owned by the same Fortune 500 corporation. The important difference between the two facilities was that one plant had a relatively mature manufacturing reliability program in place prior to the lean implementation and the second was a typical North American plant that was highly reactive in its maintenance processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The outcome of the lean implementation at the two locations could not have been more dramatically different. The lean implementation at the reliable plant was powerful and transforming; the lean implementation at the non-reliable plant did not deliver long-term results. This article will discuss my experience in leading two separate plants and why I believe that itâs critical to have a reliable facility for a successful lean manufacturing implementation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Blitz events were conducted very similarly in the two plants. Whether they were 5-S events or kaizen events focusing on a process or problem area, they were typically three to five days in length, were facilitated by either a consultant or a corporate Continuous Improvement leader, and had roughly eight to 16 hourly employees engaged in the event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events in a Non-Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The blitz events in the non-reliable plant were tougher to pull together. The first real challenge was getting participants to participate in the event. Because the work days were tough and challenging in the reactive environment, most employees were reluctant to come in and work days in excess of what they were scheduled. Managers and supervisors sponsoring the event would often have to assign employees to work on the blitz event instead of having them volunteer for the project.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An additional problem with blitz events in the non-reliable plant was establishing a baseline of performance for processes. We wanted to measure the improvements made over the course of the event, but there were many times this was not possible because of equipment downtime or process upset occurring in either the baseline measurement or during the measurement of the âafter improvementsâ section. This always resulted in deflation for the participants of the event because âthe equipment messed up.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A particularly aggravating problem that occurred in blitz events in the non-reliable plant was participants getting pulled from the event because of equipment problems. Electricians, mechanical craftsmen and area supervisors were especially hard hit with this phenomenon because their skills were either needed to get the equipment back up or their expertise was required to juggle the production schedule or shipping schedule to react to the downtime. Needless to say, it was disappointing to the team when someone who had been in on all the discussions during the event would âget yanked out of the eventâ to go take care of the dayâs problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Probably the most insidious and damaging aspect of blitz events performed in the non-reliable plant was difficulty in sustaining the gains made during the event. Because the workplace was so often either reacting to, or recovering from, a significant equipment problem, managers and supervisors struggled with executing the critical leadership behaviors that were necessary to sustain the gains that were made in blitz events. The eventual deterioration of the area or process that had improved was visible to both hourly employees and the managers. This would, in turn, reinforce the reluctance for employees to participate in future events because they felt their efforts were in vain. Management teamâs credibility suffered as well.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events in a Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My experience with blitz events in the reliable plant was dramatically different. They were truly some of the most positive workplace experiences Iâve had in my 20-year manufacturing career. The leadership team enjoyed much more management credibility with our hourly employees. This was largely because of the progress that had been made in the prior two years with implementing reliability. Hourly employeesâ daily work lives had been deeply impacted by the improvements in machine condition and the operational stability that resulted. They were very aware that we had been implementing the principles of reliability and they were very happy with results even after the first year.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This credibility resulted in hourly employees that were much more eager to participate in blitz events. People were excited about the opportunity to impact their work lives in a positive way. We certainly still had the scheduling challenges of backfilling participantsâ normal job in some cases, but there were many participants whose jobs were not backfilled for the event because the stability of the plant did not require them to be on their jobs all the time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It made an enormous difference to have all the participants in the event stay for the entire duration. The team dynamics were much more positive; it was rare for someone to have to leave the event to âtake care of problems.â This allowed all the participants to own the results and, more importantly, own the changes made in the event so they could serve to maintain the improvements and give insight to other employees about changes that were made and why they took that direction.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the facility performed more and more successful blitz events, employeesâ willingness to participate and actually lead events became greater and greater because they saw the positive changes that were implemented and they saw the results being sustained.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The opportunity to create a kanban system in finished goods existed in both plants. Both had fairly typical inventory strategies in that the sites produced inventory to match a sales forecast or to react to working capital directives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There was a dramatic difference, however, in the ability for both plants to capitalize on the opportunity to utilize kanban for producing to actual demand by the customers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban in a Non-Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As previously discussed, machine conditions in the non-reliable plant were unstable and the resulting downtime made for frequent schedule changes. Often a machine breakdown would occur which would limit our ability to produce some products. As a result, we would sometimes have to run products that were not needed for orders simply because we still needed to produce products to hit gross production targets stated in pounds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There was no way we could have implemented a kanban system to produce to the kanban signal. While we still provided excellent customer service as measured by order fill rates and shipping dates, this was largely made possible by having very large inventories that served as buffers to absorb the impact of a chaotic production schedule.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban in a Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After three years of persevering in the implementation of our reliability program, our ability to produce the production schedule became extremely strong. At the encouragement of our Continuous Improvement leader, we designed a kanban system for one of our very popular product lines. There were certainly some formidable âmental challengesâ that needed to be overcome. When warehouse personnel and scheduling personnel have had many years of a cushion in inventory, the very thought of taking inventory levels down produced much fear that needed to be managed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the team was engaged and trained in the kanban concept and the workings of the signal for inventory replenishment were created, we simply started running the system. While there were a few tweaks of the system over the first few months, the facility quickly gained confidence in their ability to produce and work with the much lower resulting inventory levels.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On the front end of implementing the kanban system, we felt that improved financials were going to be the primary benefit because of the working capital reduction. In reality, while we saw the financial impact quickly, the improvement in working conditions for our warehouse staff became âthe big win.â With much lower inventory, we saw many unanticipated benefits such as the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Wider aisles for the forklift drivers to maneuver forklifts 
&lt;LI&gt;Less stress for the forklift drivers because they had more room to work 
&lt;LI&gt;Less product damage to finished products 
&lt;LI&gt;Less property damage because of better visibility 
&lt;LI&gt;Less investment in finished product storage costs &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We continued to provide high levels of customer service even with the much lower inventory levels.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The absolute key to this process, however, was the ability to produce the right products for our customers at the right time, and by having the production machinery reliable, this gave the plant the ability to produce what the schedule called for.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The experience of leading these two similar, but very different, facilities really underscored the importance of having a plant be reliable before implementing lean manufacturing. The cadence of execution that is learned by the organization through having equipment maintenance work planned, scheduled, completed and closed out becomes a cornerstone of organization discipline that is fundamental when the elements of lean manufacturing are utilized.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The components of an effective 5-S program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" border="1" height="233" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-3.jpg" vspace="7" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5-S, or the five pillars of the visual workplace, is a systematic process of workplace organization. When I ask manufacturing people about the components of 5-S, most of them don&amp;rsquo;t think they are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just a system of keeping things organized and clean, right? Oh yeah, and they have this crazy idea that toolboxes are bad.&amp;rdquo; Or, sometimes I hear: &amp;ldquo;Why make a big program out of cleaning up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5-S is not simply eliminating toolboxes and cleaning up. While the concepts are easy to understand, most companies have not implemented them. Implementation of 5-S has many benefits: higher quality, lower costs, reliable deliveries and improved safety &amp;hellip; to name a few. These benefits are clearly relevant to any manufacturer, and they are not had simply by eliminating toolboxes and cleaning up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The intent of 5-S is to have only what you need available in the workplace, a designated place for everything, a standard way of doing things and the discipline to maintain it. Created in Japan, the components of 5-S are: seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke. Translated to English, we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Sort:&lt;/strong&gt; Remove all items from the workplace that are not needed for current production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Set in order:&lt;/strong&gt; Arrange needed items so that they are easy to find and put away. Items used often are placed closer to the employee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Shine:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure everything is clean, functioning and ready to go.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Standardize:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the method you use to maintain the first three S&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Sustain:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a habit of properly maintaining correct procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the organization, this creates fewer defects, less waste, fewer delays, fewer injuries and fewer breakdowns. These advantages translate to lower cost and higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the operator, the components of 5-S create a superior working environment. They give the operator an opportunity to provide creative input regarding how the workplace should be organized and laid out and how standard work should be done. Operators will be able to find things easily, every time. The workplace will be cleaner and safer. Jobs will be simpler and more satisfying with many obstacles and frustrations removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (Sort) requires you to distinguish between what is needed and what is not needed. Then, it requires you to discard what is not needed. This is known as &amp;ldquo;red-tagging.&amp;rdquo; A team goes through all items (tools, equipment, material, etc.) and asks the question: &amp;ldquo;Do I need this to do my job on a regular basis?&amp;rdquo; Items that are used very infrequently or not used should be red-tagged. After determining what is actually needed, update all documentation to reflect the needed parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (Set in Order) requires you to organize things so that they are easy to use, and label them so that anyone can find, use and return them to the correct place easily. Visual controls should be used where practicable in this activity; a visual control is any communication device used in the work environment that tells you at a glance how work should be done. The requirements for setting in order include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment and tool organization: Simple, organized storage with visual confirmation (you know exactly where it goes and if it is missing/empty with just a glance).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and equipment used most frequently are closest to employee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Workstations have a place for each tool, with no toolboxes or drawers that interfere with visibility and require unneeded motion to open and close.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Taping: Tape the floor to indicate areas of operations, parts, walkways, discrepant material and hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work instructions: Make sure these are current and at the workstation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Signboard strategy:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	- Indicate cell, product lines and workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	- Indicate production goals and status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	- Post area information boards with key status indicators (inventory, training, calibration etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ergonomics: Follow ergonomic guidelines in work/tool design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (Shine) involves bringing the workspace back to proper order by the end of each day. It requires periodic (at least once daily) cleanup, responsible person(s) identified for cleanup, establishment of cleanup/restocking methods (tools, checklists, etc.), and periodic supervisor inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fourth &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (Standardize) is the method by which you maintain the first three S&amp;rsquo;s. Organization, orderliness and cleanliness are maintained and made habitual by instituting 3-S duties into regular work routines. The methods need to be standardized and required company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fifth &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (Sustain) allows the organization to sustain its 5-S program. This requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		an executive 5-S champion to ensure that 5-S becomes part of the culture;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		periodic walk-through inspections/audits with posted results; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5S performance measurement of workgroups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementation of this final &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; is where most companies fall back into their old ways of doing things. Very often, 5-S is thought of as an activity rather than an element of company culture. Companies implement 5-S for several months only to find themselves back to their previous state. To make 5-S work, it is critical that performance be measured and that top management be committed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>When and how to use kaizen events</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are reluctant to utilize kaizen events because such events take a team of employees away from their &amp;quot;real jobs&amp;quot; for three to five days at a time. Companies often choose to substitute kaizen events with projects assigned to one or two individuals. Because of a lack of perceived importance and a lack of substantial participation and buy-in, very rarely does this result in true improvement. In fact, it often results in organizations claiming that lean does not work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I encounter companies in this situation, I argue that the effects of a properly planned and executed kaizen event will pay for the perceived &amp;quot;lost time&amp;quot; of the participants many times over. In fact, their &amp;quot;real jobs&amp;quot; will become easier because they will include less &amp;quot;firefighting&amp;quot; and more productive activities since kaizen events will address many of the day-to-day problems with permanent solutions instead of Band-Aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, I wrote about what makes kaizen events effective in an article called &lt;a href="http://www.emsstrategies.com/dd040105article.html"&gt;The Power of Kaizen&lt;/a&gt;. In this article on the subject, you will learn when kaizen events should be used for maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recall that kaizen events are focused three- to five-day breakthrough events that generally include the following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Defining the problem/goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Documenting the current state&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brainstorming and developing a future state&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing a follow-up plan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Presenting results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Celebrating successes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This process works in a variety of situations to solve a variety of problems. Kaizen events are often planned using &lt;a href="http://www.reliableplant.com/Meta/Tags/value%20stream%20mapping"&gt;value stream mapping&lt;/a&gt; to target the right areas for improvement. What follows is a list of some of the problems that can be solved using kaizen events:&lt;/p&gt;

		Decreasing changeover time on a piece of equipment or process. Using kaizen, a team can improve upon the time to change over equipment using the SMED system, developed by Shigeo Shingo.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizing the workplace using 5-S.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Creating a one-piece-flow work cell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing a pull system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving equipment reliability through TPM (Total Productive Maintenance).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving the manufacturability of a product design.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving a product development process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving other administrative processes such as order processing, procurement, engineering change processing and other paperwork/information processing activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen events, however, cannot solve any problem within an organization. There are certain types of improvements for which other methods should be used. Process improvements (such as Six Sigma-type analysis) aimed at yield improvement and variation/scrap reduction are key examples. Suppose that a particular process has a first-pass yield of only 85 percent when it would need to be much closer to 100 percent to run in a one-piece-flow environment. If the process must be analyzed using experiments and statistical methods, it would make sense to utilize a team but not a kaizen event. To implement these types of improvements, a problem-solving team (or a Six Sigma team) that meets regularly over a period of time works better than a kaizen team meeting for five consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to utilize kaizen events effectively, it is important to understand the types of problems for which kaizen events should and should not be used. With proper planning, kaizen events can bring breakthrough improvement to an organization on its lean journey.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A primer on 5-S and TPM workplace organization</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN id=vidDescRemain style="DISPLAY: inline"&gt;The 5-S method is a structured management program to implement workplace organisation and standardisation. 5-S improves safety, work efficiency, improves productivity and establishes a sense of ownership. And a well-organized workplace motivates people. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The program is called 5-S, since all steps start with an "S": &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;Sort&lt;/STRONG&gt; deals with the contents of a workplace, and removes all items that are not needed there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. &lt;STRONG&gt;Set in Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; refers to "a place for everything, and everything in its place" to enable easy acces to needed items. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. &lt;STRONG&gt;Shine&lt;/STRONG&gt; refers not just to cleaning, but to "being proud" about the way the workplace is organised. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. &lt;STRONG&gt;Standardize&lt;/STRONG&gt; refers to having standards that everyone has to adhere to. Visual management is an important aspect to facilitate easy undersanding of these standards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. &lt;STRONG&gt;Sustain&lt;/STRONG&gt; refers to the interaction between employees and management to incorporate the continuous improvement culture. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The 5-S management program facilitates an excellent performance: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="DISPLAY: inline"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Safety:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;A well-organized and orderly workplace is a safer workplace. 5S activities remove clutter, visual indicators alarm people for hazardous situations. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="DISPLAY: inline"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improving production efficiency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 5-S supports a smooth production process in various ways. Searching for tools is eliminated, flow principles are applied, tools storage is done where they are needed most. Location indicators visualize how things have been organized, and non conformaties are seen at once. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quality improvement:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Daily activities like inspection help to keep the production process in the right condition. Defects are prevented because deviations are spotted before they result into defects. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The training package has been produced in co-operation with Philips Electronics, Smit Transformers, Nacco Materials Handling Group, Minkels and Timmerije (injection molding).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"This training package has helped us enormously to implement 5-S in a structural way, as well as getting our operators and management team behind it. The teams themselves are now taking the initiative," &lt;BR&gt;Fred Waij, TPM manager, Heineken Breweries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information, visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.5straining.eu/"&gt;www.5straining.eu&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/5-S/~4/-gkapQzOy5M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to effectively use a 5-S assignment chart</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;One of the best aids in sustaining a daily 5-S process is found in the 5-S Assignment Chart. This assignment chart lists all the 5-S tasks to be completed in a zone (designated area) along with the frequency the task should be done (daily, weekly, monthly), the personâs name responsible for completing the task and listing of the tools needed for each task (broom, towel, etc). All you have to do is post this assignment chart in the zone to help insure the tasks get done. Sounds simple enough, right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like most concepts I have learned in lean manufacturing, it goes much deeper than what we originally think. That holds true for even the simple 5-S Assignment Chart. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For one, the posting of the 5-S assignment chart, or for that matter, any other document, sign, work instruction, standard work sheet or preventive maintenance task list, itself does not insure that the tasks are completed or followed as described. You learn that rather quickly after the initial excitement of the newly posted item turns towards the mundane. We sometime fall into the trap that anything posted is important therefore everyone will follow it. Not true. Just look at speed limit signs as an example. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So how do you use a 5-S Assignment Chart successfully?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here are just a couple of ways I found that work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) In the first column, organize alphabetically by name, the person responsible followed by the task, frequency and tools assigned to them. Typically, we list tasks first which makes it more difficult to see who is responsible and harder for the person responsible to find their assigned task. Make it easy (more visual) for each person to find their own tasks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Cluster all the tasks for each employee together if they have more than one task assigned to them. Again, makes it easier to find all your assignments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) Have all the team members divide up tasks and who is responsible. In most cases, a leader normally just assigns who gets what task and some people donât like the results. A team approach on this point gets better buy-in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) Under frequency, be more specific. Donât just say weekly, specify the actual day of the week, i.e.Tuesday.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) In addition to assigning specific days, make frequency visual. For example, use a column for each day of the week adding a symbol on the assigned day for each task. If the task is daily, put a symbol in every column of the week for that task and put it in color.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) Assign a daily task(s) to every person. The 5-S process works best if done daily so base your task listing with daily assignments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7) Keep assignments simple. Assigned tasks should be completed in a daily five-minute period.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8) Have each employee sign off individually (and daily) after completing their task. This, by itself, is not the complete answer however it is better than having someone else (a zone leader or supervisor) signing off for all tasks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9) Have the zone leader or supervisor (as part of their standard work) check and review each day that the tasks for that day were successfully completed. Their job is to coach and support employees. If a task was not complete, ask the person responsible âWhy not?â and âWhat can I do to help you get it done?â&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10) Use the best management tool, the power of âLeading by Exampleâ. Every leader should have a daily assignment and complete them daily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;11) Rotate the task assignments often. Share the burden and eliminate the boredom. &lt;/P&gt;
