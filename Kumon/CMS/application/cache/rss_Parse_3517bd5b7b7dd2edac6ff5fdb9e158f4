      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th&amp;nbsp;President of the United States last week and promptly updated the White House website with a new set of policy pages, including his &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The page makes no mention of renewable energy or climate action, marking a stark shift from President Obama. Trump&amp;rsquo;s plan also commits to embracing the oil and shale gas revolution, advancing independence from foreign oil and reviving America&amp;rsquo;s coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the website change, news broke last week of a Trump administration &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;budget blueprint&lt;/a&gt; that includes deep cuts to the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s clean energy programs. These developments seem to contrast with Trump&amp;#39;s position on promoting U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/america-is-losing-the-energy-innovation-race-trump-can-help-win-it"&gt;innovation and job growth&lt;/a&gt;. They also &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla"&gt;contradict statements&lt;/a&gt; from DOE Secretary nominee Rick Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what&amp;#39;s next for clean energy and climate action in America?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We sat down to discuss with Brandon Hurlbut, partner and co-founder of Boundary Stone Partners, an advisory firm on energy technology, public policy and finance, in Greentech Media&amp;#39;s first interview via Facebook Live. Hurlbut offers an insider perspective on Washington, D.C. and Democrat policies, having served as chief of staff for Secretary Steven Chu at the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also spoke with Shane Skelton, partner and co-founder of S2C Pacific, a policy consulting firm focused on energy and technology policy. Skelton previously served as energy policy adviser to the U.S. House of Representatives&amp;rsquo; Committee on the Budget, under then-Chairman Paul Ryan, who now serves as House Republican leader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Republican Political Donors Install Nearly as Much Solar as Democratic Donors</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/VdNqJ4uIzs8/republican-political-donors-install-nearly-as-much-solar-as-democratic-dono</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Even some of President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s fiercest critics admit that his election win was largely due to his ability to connect on a visceral level with voters who had long felt ignored and disrespected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it was his unscripted, often rambling speeches or his zest for politically incorrect barbs, Trump made many of his supporters believe that he genuinely understood their priorities and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But there is growing evidence that -- at least when it comes to clean energy -- there is a wide chasm between the policy positions the president supports and what many of his Republican supporters actually believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the campaign, Trump ignored clean energy and focused mostly on promoting coal, oil and gas. But as reputable political surveys have shown, Republican voters&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-survey-shows-renewable-energy-polls-ridiculously-well-among-trump-voter"&gt;actually want more support of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; over fossil fuels. And they are proving that with their wallets, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is one of the most intriguing findings in &lt;a href="https://powerscout.com/site/who-installs-more-solar-democrats-or-republicans-we-used-ai-to-look-at-1-5-million-houses-to-find-out/" target="_blank"&gt;a new study by PowerScout&lt;/a&gt;, an Oakland-based company that uses data to assist consumers who are considering going solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout examined about 1.5 million rooftops in the top 20 solar markets nationwide and found that Democratic and Republican party donors installed residential solar systems at roughly equal rates -- 3.06 percent of Democratic donors and 2.24 percent of Republicans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In California, by far the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest residential solar market, Republicans and Democrats install solar at about the same clip, while in Hawaii Republicans install more solar than Democrats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The timing of the study&amp;rsquo;s release to coincide with Trump&amp;rsquo;s inauguration was not an accident. &amp;ldquo;We want to put a stake in the ground and send a message to the incoming administration, to President Trump and to Secretary Perry, to show in a data-driven way that this is not a partisan issue,&amp;rdquo; said Attila Toth, the CEO and co-founder of PowerScout, who formerly ran SunEdison&amp;rsquo;s distributed generation business. &amp;ldquo;With this household-level data, you can show there is a real economic-driven, non-partisan demand for this type of clean energy asset.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout&amp;rsquo;s study is not the only research to expose the wide clean energy divide between some Republican politicians and the party&amp;rsquo;s most ardent supporters. Last September, the energy information company SolarPulse released a &lt;a href="https://www.solarpulse.com/blog/are-republicans-or-democrats-more-likely-to-invest-in-solar/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that examined data from 25,000 California homes that had installed solar between 1997 and 2015, finding that Republican-leaning communities were five times more likely to purchase rooftop solar than were communities that voted for Democrats. A 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-republicans-are-5-times-more-likely-to-buy-solar-than-democrats"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication also found that 84 percent of all registered voters, including 75 percent of Republicans, supported additional funding for clean energy sources like wind and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Pocketbook voting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout&amp;rsquo;s study was different from past research in two significant ways. Rather than studying the voting patterns and partisanship of geographic areas with relatively large amounts of installed solar, the company zoomed in on the household level. In other words, it wanted to find out how willing individual Democrats and Republicans were to shell out money for a solar installation. In addition, the study examined the homes of 1.5 million rooftops -- a robust dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reach its findings, PowerScout pulled the Federal Election Commission&amp;rsquo;s lists of donors to the Democratic and Republican parties and candidates in the top 20 solar markets. Toth felt that focusing on donors was the best gauge available for an individual household&amp;rsquo;s party affiliation. &amp;ldquo;We have seen studies before that lump people together by the voting preference of a county where they reside. To us, that is not granular enough to explain someone&amp;rsquo;s political tendencies,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If someone forks out money, that shows their political leaning at the household level.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From those publicly available lists of donors, PowerScout then filtered out work addresses, post office boxes and apartments so it could focus on single-family homes where a residential solar system could be installed. After winnowing the initial donor lists down, PowerScout was left with 1.5 million homes, 1 million of which were Democratic donors and the rest of which were Republican supporters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning to identify solar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to get the household-level data it desired, PowerScout next gathered satellite images of all 1.5 million homes of Democratic and Republican donors. Naturally, it would be too time-consuming and cumbersome to have people search each rooftop for solar panels, so the company instead employed a machine-learning model called a convolutional neural network, or CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We went through and labeled images of houses that had solar and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Ulin, head of data science at PowerScout. &amp;ldquo;You feed those into the model, and the model, based on those examples, can learn to differentiate between homes with solar and without solar.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The model isn&amp;rsquo;t actually looking at all the images, at least as we would imagine it. Instead, it converts each image into numerical values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;So every pixel in the image has three values, a different number for every red, green and blue channel. You end up with a model that has millions of variables as opposed to simple regression models that only have a handful,&amp;rdquo; said Ulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, Ulin said he optimized the model through a technique known as gradient descent. &amp;ldquo;The model goes through hundreds of iterations to find the optimal settings for millions of variables. Every time it does, we score the output and how well the model identifies the labeled images,&amp;rdquo; he said, noting that the model was about 90 percent accurate at identifying images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toth said the technology can be used to identify the people who are most likely to purchase clean energy technologies like solar and substantially cut customer-acquisition costs. &amp;ldquo;You can build a propensity model that helps you to focus marketing dollars on high-propensity customers,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With more data and smarter marketing, Toth believes that, over time, customer acquisition costs can be sliced sixfold. &amp;ldquo;Today, solar customer acquisition costs are in excess of 15 percent to 17 percent of the total purchase price,&amp;rdquo; he said, comparing those costs with the 3 percent to 4 percent average in the car industry. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason you should pay $6,000 to acquire a solar system [customer] when the hardware is costing less than that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If those cost reductions come to fruition, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that solar will become even less of a partisan issue than it is now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Will a Trade War With China Help or Hurt the American Solar Industry? Itâs Complicated</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/62fE9TXAFws/will-a-u.s.-china-trade-war-help-or-hurt-the-u.s.-solar-industry</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/will-a-u.s.-china-trade-war-help-or-hurt-the-u.s.-solar-industry</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The election of Donald Trump raises a lot of questions for the U.S. solar industry. Trump hasn&amp;#39;t exactly been supportive of solar energy, but he hasn&amp;#39;t made it an explicit target of his ire either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	President Trump&amp;#39;s impact on the solar industry could come through trade policy, an area where the president has fairly wide latitude to make rules. If he labels China a currency manipulator, as he has promised, it would give him wide authority to draw up tariffs on Chinese imports, which he has &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/21/donald-trump-has-floated-big-tariffs-what-could-im/" target="_blank"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; may be as high as 45 percent -- although a 25 percent across-the-board tariff seems to be a more common proposal. Tariffs that high could have a mixed impact on the economy broadly, and could lead to a trade war between the world&amp;#39;s two biggest economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The booming U.S. solar industry -- heavily reliant on China and other countries in Asia for low-cost supplies -- is caught in the middle of this rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are already tariffs on Chinese solar products and materials. And the solar industry has already figured out how to deal with them. Given long-simmering tensions with China over solar, it&amp;#39;s likely that tariffs wouldn&amp;#39;t have a major impact on the solar industry. But it&amp;#39;s worth looking into, assuming Trump decides to provoke China further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to trade, there&amp;#39;s rarely a simple single-order cause and effect. Trade follows something more like the butterfly effect, with broad impacts on the solar industry that would be both positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tariff cheerleaders: U.S. solar manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solar manufacturers would certainly like to see additional tariffs on Chinese imports. SolarWorld led previous trade cases against Chinese solar companies, and it&amp;#39;s easy to see how U.S. manufacturers Mission Solar, SolarCity and Suniva could see a slight advantage if additional tariffs are placed on competitors&amp;#39; products. The U.S. solar manufacturing industry has been one of the most damaged by low-cost Chinese panels and, in theory, it would see the biggest benefit from tariffs on Chinese imports. But America&amp;#39;s manufacturers must still work hard to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To put the impact of tariffs into perspective, GTM Research&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-pulse"&gt;PV Pulse Q4 2016&lt;/a&gt; estimates that blended module prices were $0.42 per watt last quarter. A 25 percent import tariff would add about $0.10 per watt to the cost of a solar panel, or $600 to the cost of a 6-kilowatt system, and a 45 percent tariff would add $0.19 per watt, $1,140 for a 6-kilowatt system. (That&amp;#39;s assuming tariffs are 100 percent effective.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Barry Cinnamon, who owns residential installer Cinnamon Solar, said customers would be willing to pay a few hundred dollars more to buy American-made modules. But he also said the upside for installers pushing domestically made panels is limited. With that in mind, he said he&amp;#39;s "not supportive of tariffs on solar modules since they jeopardize approximately 180,000 installation jobs at the expense of 20,000 manufacturing jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SolarWorld is the only cell manufacturer in the U.S., so even Mission Solar, SolarCity and Suniva would see higher costs on imported cells if subject to a tariff. If tariffs are put in place on all products from China, there would be a much wider impact to American manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	China is the lowest-cost source of supply for glass and aluminum for module frames, which are some of the biggest costs in module assembly. Then there&amp;#39;s junction boxes, inverters, racking, connectors, and other balance-of-system components that come from China and other countries in Asia. The U.S. can&amp;#39;t simply flip a switch and start manufacturing these products at scale, especially commodity components like glass or extruded aluminum that are needed in massive quantities. Tariffs on imports from a country like China could give a small boost to U.S. manufacturers, but it would also raise raw material costs for every module manufacturer in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Growing U.S. solar manufacturing jobs isn&amp;#39;t as simple as adding a few tariffs to imports from other countries. The infrastructure to make polysilicon, solar cells, extruded aluminum, junction boxes, glass, and dozens of other components in the U.S. at a cost-effective level simply doesn&amp;#39;t exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to make tariffs stick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The feasibility of tariffs helping U.S. manufacturers may also be wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the solar industry learned one thing from the tariffs on solar cells and modules put in place a few years ago, it&amp;#39;s that suppliers can adapt more quickly than tariffs can. First, manufacturers started &lt;a href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2012/10/solar-panel-tariffs-no-benefit-only-problems.html" target="_blank"&gt;tolling&lt;/a&gt; modules in places like Taiwan and then they began building plants in countries across Southeast Asia. Some of those decisions were even motivated by a drive to find lower costs than China could offer. For example, labor costs in Vietnam &lt;a href="http://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/2015/05/26/the-cost-of-business-in-vietnam-compared-with-china.html"&gt;are now lower&lt;/a&gt; than in China, changing the calculus about where to build manufacturing plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;#39;s consistent with manufacturing expansions in Southeast Asian countries other than China. And the newly diverse set of suppliers and countries of manufacturing in the solar industry would likely mute the effects of any trade war, whether you&amp;#39;re looking from the lens of a U.S. solar manufacturer or an installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, a trade war with China alone would have a minimal impact on U.S. solar manufacturing given its supply diversity today. To have a real impact on the solar industry, the Trump administration would have to start a trade war with all of Southeast Asia. And if that happened, the crossfire would hit nearly everything Americans buy -- not just solar -- creating very unpredictable and very unintended consequences for the solar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Installers -- and U.S. jobs -- would take the brunt of solar tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;#39;s one area of the solar market that will see a negative impact in any trade war: Solar installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Installers who are buying components on the open market will undoubtedly face higher costs. However, the scale of the impact may be different depending on where you sit in the solar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For residential systems, the impact of tariffs would be minimal because most costs are very local in nature. According to GTM Research&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/subscription/u.s.-solar-market-insight"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Market Insight Q4 2016&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of a residential solar system was $2.98 per watt in Q3 2016 -- so the impact of a 25 percent tariff on solar modules alone would be fairly small at just 3 percent of the total installation cost. Tariffs on other components like inverters or mounting brackets may raise costs further, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impact of tariffs would be more meaningful in the utility-scale sector. A $0.10 per watt increase in a fixed-tilt utility project that costs an average of $1.09 per watt would result in a 9 percent increase in costs. And that&amp;#39;s not including any impact from tariffs on inverters, mounting structures, or any other balance-of-system components. This could have a material impact on installers in a low-margin environment. Some solar projects may not pencil out if costs increase by that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tariffs would raise costs for companies installing solar at every scale, from residential rooftops to large utility projects, although the scale of the impact would depend on the scope of tariffs. Rising costs could&amp;nbsp;mean less demand for solar energy at every level, which would also mean less work for installers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Solar Foundation&amp;#39;s National Solar Jobs Census for 2015 estimated that 119,931 workers held jobs installing solar, 57 percent of the 208,859 U.S. solar jobs documented by the organization that year. A reduction in solar energy&amp;#39;s competitiveness could put those jobs at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s impossible to predict the exact impact of tariffs, given how fast costs change in the solar industry. Solar panel prices fell more than $0.10 per watt in the third quarter of 2016 alone -- so a tariff would likely have to be over 25 percent to make installers really worried.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar industry of 2017 is diverse enough to handle one-off tariffs without too much adjustment. And if additional tariffs do come (which is still just speculation), the industry has adapted to bigger disruptions before.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Audrey Zibelman, a Top Mind Behind NYâs Utility Reform, Is Tapped to Run Australiaâs Grid Operator</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/csIG1iWNCGQ/audrey-zibelman-tapped-to-run-australia-grid-operator</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/audrey-zibelman-tapped-to-run-australia-grid-operator</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After more than three years as New York&amp;#39;s top utility regulator, Audrey Zibelman is leaving her position. And the state. And the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This morning, Australia&amp;#39;s energy market operator &lt;a href="https://www.aemo.com.au/Media-Centre/AEMO-appoints-new-Chief-Executive-Officer-Ms-Audrey-Zibelman" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Zibelman will be taking over as chief executive in March. The organization, called AEMO, operates wholesale power markets, wholesale natural gas markets, trading hubs and gas transmission systems throughout Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Zibelman leaves New York&amp;#39;s Public Service Commission at a delicate time. The state is two and a half years into Reforming the Energy Vision, the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-launches-major-regulatory-reform-for-utilities"&gt;utility reformation plan&lt;/a&gt; announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Zibelman was tasked with figuring out how to make the state&amp;#39;s utility distribution system more competitive, dynamic and distributed -- while also encouraging utilities to find new ways of interacting with customers and making money from distributed energy services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The REV process has been complicated and, at times, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-shine-wears-off-new-yorks-rev-as-hard-work-sets-in"&gt;contentious&lt;/a&gt;. As the state looks to animate a distributed energy market, it has dealt with interconnection problems, conflicts over rate design, concerns about data sharing, and slow progress with utility pilot programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But throughout the process, Commissioner Zibelman has been well respected by utilities, distributed energy companies and various advocacy groups with competing visions for how New York&amp;#39;s electricity system should evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steve Propper, GTM Research&amp;#39;s director of grid edge, said Zibelman&amp;#39;s departure could slow the reformation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The biggest question is how will this impact the speed at which REV initiatives are implemented in the state (which have already been met with skepticism). REV is hardly operational, so with its key champion stepping down, the PSC will need to act quickly to continue to show real commitment and instill confidence in the process," said Propper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It may also buy utilities -- now called "distributed system platform providers" -- some time to build on &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/3-stats-from-new-yorks-distributed-system-plans"&gt;their implementation plans&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Zibelman has a long history in the electric power sector. She&amp;#39;s worked for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, held positions at Xcel Energy, served as chief operating officer of PJM, and founded Viridity Energy, a demand response software company that was &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/viridity-energy-sold-to-ormat-for-35m-plus-possible-future-payoff"&gt;just acquired by Ormat&lt;/a&gt; for $35 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Audrey&amp;rsquo;s vast experience in creating and managing new wholesale electricity markets, and transforming existing energy markets and large power systems will further strengthen the work that AEMO has undertaken to support Australia&amp;rsquo;s energy industry transformation,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tony Marxsen, chair of AEMO, in a statement released this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Australia&amp;#39;s power system operator is in the throes of its own distributed energy transition. With a surge of rooftop solar, wind power, and now, battery storage -- plus ballooning electricity prices due to high network access charges -- Australian regulators are being forced to reimagine&amp;nbsp;wholesale markets. And that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve turned to Zibelman, who has deep experience in both distributed energy and wholesale market design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Audrey has the vision to lead, guide and support our organization and the broader Australian energy industry as we transition our energy markets and reform power systems planning and management," said Marxsen, in his statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With New York&amp;#39;s electricity market reform process broadening in scope, Zibelman&amp;#39;s replacement will oversee an increasingly complicated regulatory mandate in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Watch Audrey Zibelman speak with Steve Propper about the status of New York&amp;#39;s regulatory reform:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Despite Headwinds, Big Capital Continues to Flow Into Solar Projects, Processes and Startups</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/8r2PZhBiXs8/Despite-Headwinds-Big-Capital-Continues-to-Flow-Into-Solar-Projects-Proce</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Despite-Headwinds-Big-Capital-Continues-to-Flow-Into-Solar-Projects-Proce</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remove incentives for renewable energy. Leave &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; out of the argument entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla" target="_blank"&gt;Eviscerate&lt;/a&gt; the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s renewable programs. Replace science-based policy with &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Trump-Chooses-ExxonMobil-CEO-Rex-Tillerson-as-Secretary-of-State"&gt;oil-buddy&lt;/a&gt; cronyism and a disrespect for &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Hell, make it illegal to deploy renewables, like the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/wyoming-bill-creates-reverse-rps" target="_blank"&gt;lawmakers are trying to do in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg" target="_blank"&gt;Honey badger&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Profit has no political allegiance, and renewables are already winning on sheer economic advantage -- today. GTM Research suggests that occasional &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/10-Solar-Trends-to-Watch-in-2017"&gt;2-cent-per-kilowatt-hour bids&lt;/a&gt; are not out of the question in the coming year and utility fixed-tilt PV system turnkey pricing will land at less than $1.00 per watt in 2017. Solar is cheap and getting cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The headwinds of manufacturing overcapacity, as well as the new U.S. government&amp;#39;s animus toward renewables, has already been baked into the stock price and guidance numbers of the solar industry. In the meantime, financiers are actively investing in solar projects, business processes and new solar companies. Little has slowed down on this front since election day. Here are the more recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	CleanCapital and Generate Capital partner on $300 million in C&amp;amp;I finance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe this is the type of financial facility that can finally jumpstart the stubborn commercial solar market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.cleancapital.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CleanCapital&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.generatecapital.com" target="_blank"&gt;Generate Capital&lt;/a&gt; to drive the acquisition of $300 million of operating clean energy assets -- with "a near-term focus on distributed solar." The idea is to "bring liquidity to the distributed solar market and provide project owners access to permanent, flexible capital and exit opportunities in an otherwise limited market," according to the companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jon Powers, co-founder and chairman of CleanCapital, told GTM that first movers developing distributed generation projects over the last decade "have limited development capital to advance their development pipeline. Opportunities to sell distributed generation assets in this fragmented marketplace remain limited and inefficient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"This is about making it a simple and efficient process for both sellers of projects and investors," said Powers. Kevin Johnson, co-founder and CCO, said the firm allows "investors -- including institutional investors, family offices and funds -- to easily invest in secure and diversified clean energy projects, and simultaneously provides sponsors an easy way to exit clean energy assets." The focus is on operating assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powers said, "If you&amp;#39;re an institutional investor, the due diligence is hard to wrestle with. CleanCapital does that due diligence on C&amp;amp;I projects in a much more efficient way." The firm&amp;#39;s platform is meant to identify, screen and manage clean energy projects for investors, until now limited to "a handful of institutional investors, banks, private equity firms and tax equity investors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar financing startup is something like a YieldCo, but as GTM reported, it&amp;#39;s "more akin to the fintech firms that are making it easier for a broader swath of investors to invest in other markets, like real estate. CleanCapital expects its platform will allow investors to evaluate projects in the pipeline and reduce transactional barriers for investors to put money into solar projects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powers said it was similar to a service like &lt;a href="http://fundrise.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Fundrise&lt;/a&gt;, a technology platform for investing in commercial real estate. CleanCapital is not the only startup taking a fintech approach to solar financing. T-Rex Group is another firm that wants to make renewable financing more transparent and efficient. &lt;a href="http://www.trexgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/a&gt; provides enterprise valuation and risk analysis tools for solar projects for both developers and investors. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/From-Shopping-to-Investing-Online-Platforms-Are-Changing-the-Business-of-S"&gt;Open Energy&lt;/a&gt; is another company developing simpler financing tools for commercial solar that are modeled after consumer debt products. Other funds such as &lt;a href="http://www.wundercapital.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Wunder Capital&lt;/a&gt; are also focused on bringing in a more diverse set of investors, particularly smaller ones with as little as $1,000 to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Investors are excited about a rinse-and-repeat opportunity,&amp;rdquo; said Powers. &amp;ldquo;Our homework is to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re bringing them prepared offerings.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This $300 million in funding comes from &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Cleantech-Funding-Train-Keeps-on-Rolling"&gt;Generate Capital&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Jigar Shah, Scott Jacobs and Matan Friedman to provide financing for energy, agriculture and water projects, with $150 million in infrastructure programs in 2015. Generate offers standard financial products, such as asset-backed lending, project finance, asset warehouses and other short-term financing, as well as custom products. Scott Jacobs, CEO of the firm, said, &amp;ldquo;For many years, the market has been crying out for permanent, flexible capital, for transparency in underwriting and for efficiency in transacting, so we designed our business specifically for these purposes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GTM Research&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/time-to-give-small-commercial-solar-more-attention"&gt;Solar Analyst Nicole Litvak&lt;/a&gt; and Generate Capital&amp;#39;s Jigar Shah co-authored an article for GTM in which they wrote, "Despite all of the current market challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that small commercial solar is too big of a market for anyone to pass up. To get the right projects into the hands of the investors who want them, [small and medium-sized business] financiers have to shift from being opportunistic to becoming true &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/small-commercial-financiers-need-to-be-service-providers"&gt;service providers&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		SolarCity&amp;#39;s $145 million securitization, its fifth&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		SolarCity received a &lt;a href="http://https://www.krollbondratings.com/show_report/6122" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary rating&lt;/a&gt; on three classes of notes from bond rating agency &lt;a href="http://www.kbra.com" target="_blank"&gt;Kroll&lt;/a&gt; for a total of $145,000,000 in a residential distributed solar securitization. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/kbra.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		This is SolarCity&amp;#39;s fifth securitization, and it&amp;#39;s secured by a pool of 9,609 solar loans distributed across 14 states. The weighted average FICO score of the "obligors" is 728. According to Kroll, "The transaction benefits from credit enhancement in the form of over-collateralization, excess cash flow, an interest reserve account and an inverter replacement reserve account."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Nearly 4 gigawatts of wind and solar projects&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		According to Credit Suisse, "Nearly 4 gigawatts of wind and solar projects and project pipelines traded hands [last] week."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Spruce to drive $445 million in residential solar&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.pv-tech.org/news/spruce-secures-us445-million-in-debt-financing-for-residential-pv-systems" target="_blank"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://solarindustrymag.com/spruce-finance-raises-capital-to-back-more-residential-solar?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=LNH+01-20-2017&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SI+Latest+News+Headlines" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Spruce Finance, a financier of home solar and energy-efficiency measures, raised enough tax equity and debt to drive $445 million in residential photovoltaic power purchase agreements and leases in 2017. Spruce also closed a $105 million "back leverage facility against existing projects" led by Investec and Silicon Valley Bank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		SolarReserve gains $78 million tax equity investment&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Concentrating-Solar-Power-Isnt-Worth-Much-Without-Storage-Say-Leading-Exe"&gt;SolarReserve&lt;/a&gt; won a $78 million tax equity investment from Capital One for its 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Project, a utility-scale concentrated solar plant employing molten salt energy storage, enabling 24-hour operation. The facility generates 110 megawatts of electricity plus 1,100 megawatt-hours of energy storage to NV Energy under a 25-year power-purchase agreement, according to the company. SolarReserve, along with investors ACS Cobra and Santander, will maintain an ownership stake. In 2015, SolarReserve won approval to build a 260-megawatt tower project with storage in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Schneider Electric buys Renewable Choice Energy&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://bizwest.com/216491-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Schneider Electric&lt;/a&gt;, French energy management and automation giant, acquired &lt;a href="http://se-library.com/Flash-News_Schneider-Electric-Renewable-Choice.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Renewable Choice Energy&lt;/a&gt;, a C&amp;amp;I renewable project developer and renewable energy advisory platform. Details of the transaction were not disclosed. Renewable Choice&amp;#39;s clients include 160 of the Fortune 500 companies. Schneider acquired Summit Energy Services, a provider of outsourced energy procurement and sustainability services to C&amp;amp;I and MUSH markets, in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		D.light raised $10.5 million more for off-grid solar&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.dlight.com/" target="_blank"&gt;D.light&lt;/a&gt;, furnishing and financing off-grid solar lighting products, added $10.5 million in funding from &lt;a href="http://www.norfund.no" target="_blank"&gt;Norfund&lt;/a&gt;, Beyond the Grid, and Shell Foundation. The company claims to sell hundreds of thousands of units per month with a "commanding market share in emerging markets" and a focus on Africa and Asia. The company has raised &lt;a href="http://www.dlight.com/files/5314/8455/3781/dlightFundingPressRelease-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more than $40 million&lt;/a&gt; over the last four months. As GTM has reported, solar-powered lanterns equipped with LEDs have &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-lighting-has-eliminated-about-20-million-kerosene-lanterns"&gt;eliminated more than 20 million&lt;/a&gt; traditional lighting sources, primarily kerosene lanterns.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Doerr and Rodgers invest $10 million in Enphase&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		T.J. Rodgers, founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and John Doerr, chairman of Kleiner Perkins, have emerged as white-knight saviors for troubled solar microinverter firm &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Silicon-Valleys-John-Doerr-and-TJ-Rodgers-Invest-10M-in-Enphases-Microin"&gt;Enphase&lt;/a&gt;. The Silicon Valley icons are investing $10 million in the firm, and Rodgers is joining the board of directors. It&amp;#39;s a bit of an unusual move for this odd couple. Kleiner was an investor in Enphase under the normal order of things, back when it was a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Doerr has invested in some of venture capital&amp;#39;s most famous successes (Google, Amazon, Sun, Intuit), as well as in some less than successful efforts (GO Corporation, MyCFO, Segway). He spearheaded KPCB&amp;#39;s investment efforts in greentech, including funding Silver Spring Networks, Fisker Automotive, Bloom Energy, Opower and Proterra. T.J. Rodgers is the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, a force in Silicon Valley, an early equity investor in SunPower, and a vintner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Solar developer Silicon Ranch raised $55 million&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.siliconranchcorp.com"&gt;Silicon Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a developer, owner and operator of solar energy plants, closed on an equity round of more than $55 million led by &lt;a href="http://www.partnersgroup.com" target="_blank"&gt;Partners Group&lt;/a&gt;, and joined by Silicon Ranch shareholders including the Greystone Infrastructure Fund. Silicon Ranch develops-to-own all of its projects and attracted more than $165 million of new equity capital last year. Silicon Ranch built the first large-scale solar projects in Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

	Nearly simultaneously with President Trump&amp;rsquo;s oath of office Friday, the White House website shifted to remove climate-change related content from the Obama administration and supplant it with a new statement of Trump&amp;rsquo;s energy policy -- one focused, it said, on reducing &amp;ldquo;burdensome regulations on our energy industry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those are just words -- but an action hours later by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus had more teeth. Priebus&amp;rsquo; memorandum, issuing a government-wide freeze on new or pending regulations, would appear to have the effect of sweeping up four very nearly finished Energy Department energy-efficiency standards, affecting an array of products, including portable air conditioners and commercial boilers. The standards are designed to reduce energy use, and, in the process, consumer bills and greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/california-utilities-want-1-billion-to-promote-electric-cars/" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;: California Utilities Want $1 Billion to Promote Electric Cars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;rsquo;s utilities are asking for more than $1 billion to spend on electric car-charging stations that will help the state meet its goal of getting 1.5 million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Edison International&amp;rsquo;s Southern California Edison utility asked state regulators on Friday for permission to collect $570 million from customers over five years to pay for, among other things, equipment installations that&amp;rsquo;ll support about 1,800 charging stations for electric trucks. PG&amp;amp;E Corp. requested $253 million for efforts including charging systems for electric buses and delivery trucks. Sempra Energy&amp;rsquo;s San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric utility said it was applying for $246 million for similar programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/trump-fabricates-wages-figure-on-first-day-21098" target="_blank"&gt;Climate Central&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Trump White House Distorts Wages Figure on First Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president on Friday, the White House said that eliminating power plant climate rules, a clean water rule and other environmental regulations would &amp;ldquo;greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next seven years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The statement, included on the White House&amp;rsquo;s website to justify Trump&amp;rsquo;s drive to eliminate environmental rules affecting the energy sector, was a distortion. And if it was true, it would represent wage gains equivalent to less than $20 per American every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The figure was based on a paper produced by a Louisiana State University finance professor in 2015 on behalf of a fossil fuel industry nonprofit. The paper, which was not peer reviewed, investigated potential economic impacts if all protected federal lands were opened to unlimited oil, gas and coal mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/business/economy/climate-change-california-new-york.html" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;On Climate Change, Even States in Forefront Are Falling Short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California is far from providing the leadership needed in the battle against climate change. Distracted by the competing objective of shuttering nuclear plants that still produce over a fifth of its zero-carbon power, the state risks failing the main environmental challenge of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mark Muro, director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, has compiled a ranking of progress toward decarbonization within the United States. In 2014, he found, California had the third-lowest carbon dioxide emissions per person, behind only the District of Columbia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Its progress of late, however, has been less than stellar: Despite its aggressive deployment of wind turbines and solar panels, the carbon intensity of California&amp;rsquo;s economy -- measured by the CO2 emissions per unit of economic product -- declined by only 26.6 percent between 2000 and 2014. That put it in 28th place. In New York, which came in seventh, carbon intensity declined by 35.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/pms-postbrexit-strategy-includes-energy-storage-and-battery-research-centre-35385466.html" target="_blank"&gt;Belfast Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;: Post-Brexit Strategy Includes Energy Storage and Battery Research Centre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Battery storage has been described by the United States as a "holy grail" of renewable technology and the Prime Minister has ordered a review of options to create a new research institution in the field, Downing Street said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport will analyze options for a new institute to build on existing strengths in universities and companies in battery technology, energy storage and grid technology. He will report back in early 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Trump Administration Scrubs Mentions of Climate and Renewables From White House Website</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/2j0BYNA-axw/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A change has come to Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Immediately after Donald Trump assumed the office of president Friday, the presidential URL changed. Where there once was "Energy," now there is "&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;An America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;." And where there once was a climate action plan, now there is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;no mention of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The social cost of carbon -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/oira/social-cost-of-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;. The Clean Power Plan -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-record/climate" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vestigial page titles still appear in a Google search, but the links lead nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During and after the election, Trump had spoken derisively of federal efforts to combat climate change, but had also signaled a willingness to embrace renewables as a domestically produced energy source and jobs driver. After months of speculation about how Trump would act toward clean energy once in office, the administration has clearly signaled its intent to erase President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s clean energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Obama-era website lives on &lt;a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so the content itself will not be lost. The scrubbing, though, indicates that the peaceful transition of power need not coincide with a continuity of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt; lays out a new course: "President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Right there, as explicitly as it can be written: The Trump administration plans to kill Obama&amp;#39;s climate policies. And it starts with the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A search within the site for the phrase "climate change" turns up one page, a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/mamieeisenhower" target="_blank"&gt;biography of former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;. The article references the climate of San Antonio, as well as the word "changes" in a non-climatic context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plan also asserts the value of domestic energy production: "In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America&amp;rsquo;s national security interest." The policy lists the domestic energy sources that qualify:&amp;nbsp;shale, oil, natural gas and coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean coal technology, which is only just beginning to prove itself at commercial scale, gets a shout-out. But renewables, which accounted for &lt;a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29492"&gt;the majority of new energy capacity&lt;/a&gt; added last year, don&amp;#39;t earn a mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While declaring a need to develop energy at home and cast off the nation&amp;#39;s dependence on oil cartel OPEC, the statement also makes an ominous reference to expansion abroad: "At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy." This presages a strategy of fossil-fuel exploration not just at home, but overseas, replacing Paris treaty climate commitments with help for new drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even basic landing pages for White House organizational divisions have disappeared. Try searching for the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq" target="_blank"&gt;Council on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Science and Technology Policy&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the landing page for Statements and Releases from the Press Office has gone blank, so a casual reader won&amp;#39;t stumble upon any mentions of the danger of climate change or the jobs created by the clean energy industry while scrolling back through the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of the Environmental Protection Agency, which crafted the CPP, had not been touched as of this writing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean energy industry groups are gearing up to pitch wind and solar as major job creators. They&amp;#39;ll have their work cut out for them to even gain recognition in the new president&amp;#39;s energy policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>In New York, the Grid Is Becoming a Digital Lab</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/ieSCCwmT6lM/in-new-york-the-grid-is-becoming-a-digital-lab</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/in-new-york-the-grid-is-becoming-a-digital-lab</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	America&amp;rsquo;s first power plant was built in Manhattan. The first transmission of electricity occurred between Niagara Falls and Buffalo. And the first public power organization was founded in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, that power provider, the New York Power Authority -- or NYPA -- is working to digitize the state&amp;rsquo;s grid end-to-end. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk with NYPA CEO Gil Quiniones about his push to create a "&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-power-authority-launches-a-digital-foundry-for-the-energy-industry" target="_blank"&gt;digital foundry&lt;/a&gt;" where the next generation of electricity inventors and innovators can reimagine the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the second half of the show, Katherine Hamilton gives us an update from the World Economic Forum, where thinkers from all across the globe are also reimagining the energy system -- while also grappling with a new world order in the wake of America&amp;#39;s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure to come to our live show on February 3 in New York City. We&amp;#39;ll be at the &lt;a href="http://www.cuenergysymposium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Columbia Energy Symposium&lt;/a&gt; debating the latest developments in energy and cleantech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This podcast is sponsored by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://kaco-newenergy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;KACO New Energy&lt;/a&gt;, a leading solar inverter company with superior engineering and unmatched customer service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Massachusetts Decided to Set an Energy Storage Target. What Should It Be?</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~3/LReh1zNY4eA/massachusetts-energy-storage-target-how-big-should-it-be</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/massachusetts-energy-storage-target-how-big-should-it-be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Bay State could soon follow the Bay Area as a leading battery boomtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/12-27-16-doer-letter-to-conferees-storage-target.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt;, at the close of 2016, that it would set an energy storage target. Now it has six months to figure out what that number should be and how to implement it, following the timeline set by &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/an-energy-storage-mandate-could-be-coming-soon-to-massachusetts"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; last summer. Once complete, this will be only the third state-level target after California and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;#39;s mandate gave it a decisive lead in attracting storage companies and deploying the technology in homes, businesses and on the grid. Massachusetts currently has very little storage deployed, but it is already home to a cluster of storage startups that spun off from research at MIT. With an effective target, Massachusetts could set itself up as the second hub of the U.S. storage industry, while streamlining the operation of its grid and the integration of new renewable generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finding the right target, though, requires a careful balancing of competing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"DOER should assure the target is large enough that substantial, relevant experience is gained by all, but not so large that it becomes unworkable and a substitute for the fully functioning market," wrote Phil Giudice, CEO and president of Cambridge-based storage company Ambri, in a letter to DOER Commissioner Judith Judson in December.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DOER isn&amp;#39;t starting from scratch here. The department had a hand in the &lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt; report from September, which comprehensively analyzed the value of storage for the Massachusetts grid and concluded that up to &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-the-new-massachusetts-energy-storage-report-is-such-a-big-deal"&gt;1,766 megawatts of storage installed by 2020&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;would maximize savings for ratepayers. Storage can reduce the state&amp;#39;s system costs like peak capacity, transmission and distribution upgrades, overall energy prices, integration of intermittent renewables, and ancillary grid services that smooth out the momentary differences between supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The authors included a humbler proposal -- namely, that 600 megawatts would be achievable given current market and regulatory realities, and still save ratepayers $800 million by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state could go in a different direction after gathering stakeholder input this month. Questions remain about how exactly the target would be implemented, which will have a significant impact on what kind of real-world changes it drives. Given the uncertainty, GTM reached out to policy experts and storage industry professionals active in Massachusetts to hear what they hope the state decides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Keep it 600&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on current market design and state rules, 600 megawatts is a reasonable target, said &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/state-of-charge-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coauthor Jacqueline DeRosa, vice president of emerging technologies at Customized Energy Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The 1,766 megawatt number makes some assumptions that the world is a certain way," she said. It&amp;#39;s more of a best-case scenario, if storage deployment could proceed optimally without bureaucratic or regulatory obstacles. But, she added, "It&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to change the world overnight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 600 MW goal reflects the deployments the state could likely achieve in the near future. It was the outcome of collaborative discussions held by DOER with stakeholders like utilities, project developers and storage vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common refrain among energy storage professionals interviewed for this story was that a higher number would be great, but 600 megawatts is a strong starting point. It would be a big step up from the approximately 2 megawatts of advanced storage capacity the state has now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With two and a half years from the adoption of the targets to their due date, the state may opt for a less ambitious number initially. It would be possible to hit 600 megawatts in that timeframe, though, said Ravi Manghani, energy storage director at GTM Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For others, like Ted Ko, director of policy at commercial storage company Stem, 600 megawatts is the minimum for attracting a bustling industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The state can and should go higher -- the industry has shown time and again that it is ready to respond quickly, at scale, when given a big enough market signal," he wrote in an email Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What type is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The energy storage industry is still young enough that just saying the words "storage mandate" gets folks fired up. The fact of the matter is, though, the number itself doesn&amp;#39;t mean very much in terms of what the deployment will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The category of energy storage includes systems that operate on a matter of minutes, or for half an hour, or a couple hours, or very many hours. Different jobs require different durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"My biggest wish is that the storage be discussed in terms of its application, and therefore the type of technology that is best suited to meet that application," said Jonathan Milley, director of business development at Massachusetts-based battery maker Vionx. "If you need a hammer, don&amp;rsquo;t get a screwdriver."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vionx is scaling its flow battery technology, and has one system operating in Massachusetts, one being commissioned and one under construction. Those three will add up to more than 1 megawatt of capacity at 6 hours duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s not surprising to hear a long-duration battery maker recommending a carve-out for long-duration batteries. Without that, cheap, short-duration lithium-ion batteries could swarm the mandate. Similarly, Ambri, which is commercializing a new liquid metal battery technology, recommended that part of the procurement target go to demonstrations of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Company interests aside, there&amp;#39;s a strong argument to be made for connecting the storage mandate to particular services on the grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt; report found the most lucrative savings from storage come from using it for peak capacity, which defers expensive gas peaker plant construction and lowers prices in capacity markets. If the state decides to prioritize storage taking over the role of peaking plants to save ratepayers lots of money, it could create a mandate with a certain percentage of capacity dedicated to longer-duration storage for peaking capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, if the state wants to ensure that storage can meet certain ancillary service needs in the near future, it could set a target for short duration batteries. DOER asked stakeholders to comment not just on the scale of the target, but the structure, so targeted goals such as these could end up in the final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further guidance could also address whether the storage goes in front of the meter, putting it in the realm of utilities, or behind the meter, under the purview of commercial and residential customers. Ko suggested one-third of the target should be set aside for behind the meter storage, to take advantage of private investment to spur deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California set a precedent in this regard, as it required its three investor-owned utilities to procure storage at the transmission, distribution and customer levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Who owns it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who controls the storage asset says a lot about what it will look like, so some stakeholders are pushing for the target to address this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the target expects utilities to shoulder most of the burden, they could push for a lower target, because they&amp;#39;ve have to do all the work. Opening up ownership to a wider range of entities spreads out the responsibility, and diversifies the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ko proposed that a minimum of 50 percent of storage installations should be for customer or third-party-owned systems. That would carve out some territory for Stem, which owns and operates storage systems on behalf of commercial customers, but it would create opportunities for other companies too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"A primary purpose of any storage mandate is to enable all stakeholders to learn from a wide range of business models and see where the market wants to use and evolve the services," he said. "Last year&amp;rsquo;s energy bill gave the utilities permission to own storage, so if a minimum isn&amp;rsquo;t set, the mandate could be met with a handful of large projects used in a utility-owned business model."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If DOER chooses to prioritize storage as driver of business learning, it could even consider a carve-out for storage designed or built in-state, although out-of-state battery companies would have something to say about that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Learn from the West&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Massachusetts benefits from the chance to watch a storage mandate unfold in California over the last couple years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"California has absolutely led, they broke open the market, they really put a shock to the utility system and said the world is going to be different," said Matt Roberts, executive director of the Energy Storage Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One highlight: launching a mandatory storage deployment did not explode the grid. The utilities are chugging along toward the 1.3-gigawatt goal and do not appear to be suffering from overexertion. In the meantime, the policy nourished a once-tiny industry and turned it into a considerably larger one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The grid benefited too. When the enormous natural-gas leak transpired at Aliso Canyon, the Southern Calif. utilities fast-tracked storage deployment to keep meeting local capacity needs in the absence of all that fossil fuel. The storage industry, buoyed by previous deployments, responded with cheaper-than-ever bids and rapid deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That said, Massachusetts has differed from California in its approach to forming the policy. The eastern state has prioritized stakeholder buy-in throughout the process as a means to collaboratively form the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"In California, it was a little more of a top-down, &amp;#39;Go procure this stuff&amp;#39; type of approach," Roberts said. "Massachusetts is a little more bottom-up, a little more, &amp;#39;Let&amp;#39;s get together and everyone show their math.&amp;#39;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a utility wants a certain target, it has to explain why. Meanwhile, storage companies have a chance to justify their dream targets. The final product will be some kind of synthesis of many voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;#39;s mandate benefited from a strong collaboration between the California Public Utilities Commission and grid operator CAISO, which allowed storage to play more of a role at the wholesale market level. That kind of working relationship isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed between Massachusetts and ISO New England, Manghani noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"California had the luxury of an ISO that has jurisdiction in a single state," he said. "ISO New England has to work across multiple New England states. That could cause some friction.&amp;nbsp;Without the successful and wholehearted participation of ISO New England, the mandate would lose some of its effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are plenty of rules and policies under Massachusetts&amp;#39; control on which the state can act quickly, like adding storage as a qualified technology under the Alternative Portfolio Standard. To unlock the full potential value of storage, though, the ISO would need to change certain rules governing the wholesale electricity markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a world with a more developed storage industry, Massachusetts has more options to choose from in crafting a target that best serves its own goals and desires. The choices made there in the coming months will model a path forward for the next state to take this plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
