            <title>How to Check Machines for Soft Foot</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/11/1/4556ace1-23ca-4d20-90a5-7dd7bec81912_check-machine-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 211px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Soft foot, also known as machine frame distortion, is a common problem that affects rotating machinery. It can result in a range of mechanical and quality problems, including compromised alignment, high vibration levels, accelerated wear and tear, increased power consumption, premature failure of bearings and seals, metal fatigue and distortion. While soft foot generally isn&amp;rsquo;t regarded as a critical condition and is often overlooked, the consequences of ignoring the symptoms can be quite serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Is Soft Foot?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In simple terms, soft foot can be likened to a chair that has one leg shorter than the other three. This unevenness and lack of uniform contact with the floor causes a rocking motion when someone sits in the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With machines, soft foot results when one or more of the feet are shorter, longer or angled differently than the others, or if the feet are damaged, warped or twisted. It can also be caused by accumulated dirt or debris under the machine&amp;rsquo;s feet, dents in the machine base or excessive tension on the feet. When the base bolts are tightened, this non-uniformity puts undue stress on the machine, as the foot is forced to bend or twist to conform to the base plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Diagnosing Soft Foot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How can you determine whether your machinery is suffering from soft foot? The condition has different levels of severity, but your machine may have soft foot if you notice high vibration levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soft foot creates a load on the rotating shaft, which causes shaft deflection. This in turn can result in discernible rocking of the machine or vibration when the shaft turns. However, the condition doesn&amp;rsquo;t always lead to an increase in overall machine vibration, so it&amp;rsquo;s recommended that vibration data be collected for an accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the calculated movement of the machine&amp;rsquo;s foot when it is either tightened or loosened is at least 0.002 inches (0.0508 millimeters) to 0.003 inches (0.0762 millimeters) while the other feet are bolted tightly in place, then the machine is deemed to have soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When soft foot is present, there is often a significant 2x alternate current line frequency peak. When this peak is observed, it is a good indicator that the problem is soft foot rather than one of imbalance or misalignment. Phase analysis can also be used to determine soft foot by working out the relative motion between two different parts of the machinery, such as the machine frame and the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to know whether your machine suffers from soft foot, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what causes the condition. Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Twisted, bent or warped machinery frames or base plates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A damaged or uneven foundation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Too many shims under a foot&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bent or deformed shim&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Twisted, warped, dented or damaged feet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dirt or debris under the feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soft foot can severely affect a machine&amp;rsquo;s operation. Therefore, it is essential to include checks for this condition as part of the pre-alignment process for your equipment. If you suspect your machinery may be at risk for the condition, then it&amp;rsquo;s wise to investigate further using a good laser alignment tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pruftechnik Consolidates North American Operations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Pruftechnik recently announced the merger of its Canadian and U.S. operations to further establish its presence in North America. With the new organization, the makers of Optalign and Rotalign will begin direct distribution of their products in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The new operation enables Pruftechnik to bridge the gap between R&amp;amp;D, product management, international sales and production in Germany and the end-user community in the United States,&amp;quot; said Florian Buder, CEO at Pruftechnik North America. &amp;quot;The &amp;#39;factory-direct&amp;#39; approach makes us more customer-centric.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leader in laser alignment systems and a solution provider for the maintenance of rotating equipment, Pruftechnik offers a portfolio of products and services that ranges from the monitoring of machine health and fault diagnosis to corrective solutions such as alignment and field balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company currently operates four offices in North America: Pruftechnik Philadelphia and San Diego, which focus on sales, distribution and support of the company&amp;#39;s alignment and vibration lines as well as machinery services including the Paralign roll alignment service; Pruftechnik Montreal, which will continue its operations on Canadian soil out of its Laval office; and Pruftechnik&amp;#39;s 100-percent-owned group member Eddytech Inc. in Cleveland, which represents the company&amp;#39;s nondestructive testing business unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our extensive local distribution and support network comprising 20 representatives across the territory remains mostly unchanged, which guarantees a seamless transition for our existing users,&amp;quot; added Buder.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Shaft Alignment Basics: Controlling Backlash</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Backlash is unintended movement that occurs when rotating shafts during an alignment. It is most often caused by looseness in the coupling. On misaligned machines, backlash can cause measurement errors. This 1-minute, 43-second video explains the two guidelines that have been established for controlling backlash and the techniques that should be followed even when there are no obvious signs of backlash.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF Introduces Shaft Alignment Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recently introduced a new shaft alignment tool with enhanced measuring and reporting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developed for use in industrial applications utilizing rotating machines, the TKSA 41 helps identify and correct shaft misalignment to improve equipment uptime and lower maintenance costs. The instrument has been designed to make shaft alignment easy, even for operators with minimal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comprised of two wireless measuring units, large detectors and bright lasers, the TKSA 41 provides precise measurements, even in challenging conditions or difficult-to-access applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The liquid-crystal display (LCD) with touchscreen navigation makes alignment fast and simple, while the free measurement feature allows alignment measurements to start at any angle and finish with a total angular sweep of only 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TKSA 41&amp;#39;s live view supports intuitive measurements and facilitates horizontal and vertical alignment corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because the instrument enables hands-free measurement by detecting when the heads are in the correct position, operators can use both hands to rotate and hold the shafts in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After each alignment, the TKSA 41 automatically generates a customized report with notes and pictures available from its built-in camera. The camera also enables QR codes to be scanned for machine identification and access to the machine library to review past alignment reports or to start a new alignment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TKSA 41 replaces its predecessor, the widely used TKSA 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Reliability Concepts Unveils New Belt Alignment Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/7/68ba6632-6f0e-42de-b0d2-0c97080284f1_tool for web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 267px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Reliability Concepts recently introduced a new green laser system to make belt alignments faster, easier and more accurate. The B.A.T. belt alignment tool utilizes cross-firing green lasers and Glowline target technology to help take belt alignment to a new level of precision and repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The B.A.T. Belt Alignment Tool has made belt alignment more reliable, since our patent-pending cross-firing technology eliminates the error introduced from single-laser belt alignment systems,&amp;quot; said Michael Olszewski, president of Reliability Concepts. &amp;quot;Users will have two independent belt alignment systems or can choose to use them together for our cross-firing method of belt alignment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Available in three configurations and fully upgradeable, the B.A.T. Belt Alignment Tool is able to perform simple flatness measurements by using the bull&amp;rsquo;s-eye level and targets. The tool can also detect defects, as it is virtually impossible to line up both lasers on the Glowline targets if the pulley or shaft is bent, if the shaft is worn or if other defects exist such as a broken, worn or poorly installed taper-locking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in Coldwater, Mich., Reliability Concepts offers solutions for condition-based monitoring, vibration analysis consulting and corrective technologies.

&lt;p&gt;
	The Alisensor Shaftlaser features a 3-D layout with live alignment diagrams and graduated tolerance control to show both acceptable and excellent tolerances. Vertical and horizontal misalignment results are shown simultaneously in a 3-D view, making them easier to understand and correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system also consists of two wireless, Bluetooth laser measuring units pre-assembled on versatile shaft brackets with adaptable components for mounting with chains or magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Unlike shaft alignment systems where the computer display unit can cost thousands of dollars to replace, the Alisensor Shaftlaser can simply use an iOS device like an iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch by downloading the free App measurement programs,&amp;quot; said Greg Knitz, president of Alignment Supplies Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Alisensor Shaftlaser has the ability to perform a standard 9-12-3 o&amp;#39;clock position measurement or use a minimum of only two 20-degree shaft rotations. The system also includes embedded help functions like video demonstrations and instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the Alisensor Shaftlaser can create fully customizable PDF reports and include a photo of the machine directly in the report. The report file is automatically saved when the measurement is complete, allowing it to be easily shared like other files on any iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Balancing Rigid Rotors in the Field</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.&amp;quot; â Nikola Tesla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Could Tesla&amp;#39;s secret be the energy wasted due to vibration at a frequency equal to shaft speed all caused by rotor unbalance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Balanced rotors are critical for achieving production and profit goals. Unbalance creates high vibration, which leads to other faults resulting in decreased machine life, wasted energy and reduced efficiency. Smooth-running machines are required for producing products that meet customer specifications. The IOSR Journal of Mechanical and Civil Engineering states that rotor unbalance is the major cause of vibration problems. A good balancing process is essential for successful physical asset management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is a Rigid Rotor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A rotor that operates at a rotational speed below 70 percent of its critical speed is considered to be a rigid rotor. The critical speed is the speed at which resonance occurs by exciting its natural frequency. Ninety percent or more of rotors are rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Unbalance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rotor unbalance can be defined as a condition that exists when the geometric center and the center of mass (also known as the center of gravity) do not coincide. In reality, these centers never coincide exactly, but the goal of rotor balancing is to reduce the unbalance to the point that machine life is not negatively impacted by the residual unbalance. The balancing technician attempts to bring the center of mass and the geometric center to the same point or close enough to meet a predetermined balance standard. There will always be some residual unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/3dbba8d6-8d57-4b78-8af9-7d31506f167e_figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 332px; height: 221px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Balancing Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several standards organizations have developed balancing standards for use on various machines. ISO and API are a couple of examples. Some companies develop their own standards. Which standard should you use? Choose standards that will allow you to achieve the required machine life and preserve equipment functions to the levels required by your processes. This may sound like a political answer, but in reality, the standards may vary depending on your plant&amp;#39;s requirements. The requirements will already be known if you are using a well-defined physical asset management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance is measured in units of ounce/inches or gram/millimeters. However, when you balance in the field, you usually balance to a vibration standard because it is easier to determine machine vibration levels than to determine residual unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vibration due to unbalance is directionally proportional to the amount of unbalance. If the vibration levels due to unbalance are lowered to an acceptable level, the amount of unbalance is also brought to within an acceptable standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Forces Incurred by Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unbalance produces rotor vibration.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Double the amount of unbalance, and the forces due to unbalance double.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Double the rotor speed, and the forces quadruple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Types of Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Static or force&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Couple&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dynamic or a combination of force and couple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/c000fa10-640c-4559-89dd-9b24c5fb111e_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 74px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Causes of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Blowholes in cast parts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eccentricity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improper key length&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stress relief distortion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermal distortion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Corrosion or uneven wear&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Deposit buildup and component shift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Asymmetrical design and assembly errors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotor damage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair work errors such as use of wrong coupling bolts or washers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Balancing is performed after acquiring vibration and phase measurements. There are three requirements for balancing: steady vibration, steady phase, and the vibration and phase measured must be due to rotor unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before attempting to field balance a rotor, follow these basic steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform a vibration analysis on the machine.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take radial and axial vibration readings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure the rotor is clean.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verify there are no loose parts on the rotor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always correct other problems before attempting to balance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use a dial indicator to check total indicated runout (TIR).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove previous balance correction weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collectors/analyzers such as the Vibxpert can be used to perform the vibration analysis necessary to identify unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/98ff7559-b808-4e6a-a260-7af14953b166_figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 324px; height: 368px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance is a radial force and produces a vibration frequency equal to shaft speed. The radial force can sometimes produce a vibration in an axial direction, especially in overhung or cantilevered rotors. In these rotors, the axial vibration may be even greater than the radial vibration. The radial force causes the shaft to deflect, producing an axial direction vibration in the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Normally, unbalance will produce a 1&amp;times; or shaft speed vibration that is 80 percent or more of the total vibration. If 1&amp;times; vibration is less than 80 percent, suspect other problems in addition to the unbalance. This is the same as stating that the vibration at other frequencies should not exceed 20 percent of the overall vibration. It may be necessary to correct the other problems before the rotor can be properly balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unbalance always exerts an equal force in all radial directions, but the vibration due to the unbalance is almost never equal in all directions. The horizontal vibration is usually the highest in amplitude because most machines are less stiff in that direction. Be careful because there are exceptions such as looseness in the bearings and vertical resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If vibration amplitudes in the radial positions differ by 5:1 or more, other problems usually exist. If more than three harmonics of shaft speed are visible in the spectrum, other problems could be present, with the most likely being looseness. All other problems should be corrected before attempting to balance the rotor. The image below shows the corresponding measurement and weight correction planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/21/9e6f165d-05cd-479e-9137-fb29d5d3a1f3_figure 4.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 354px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Phase Indications of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase is a very important tool when diagnosing unbalance because 1&amp;times; vibration can be generated by several other problems. Phase numbers shown below may vary by 15 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Force unbalance phase difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 0 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Couple unbalance phase difference: &lt;/strong&gt;180 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic unbalance phase difference:&lt;/strong&gt; 0 to 180 degrees when comparing the same radial positions on two bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The phase shift from horizontal to vertical should be approximately 90 degrees for all types of rotor unbalance when measured on the same bearing. The phase should be steady and repeatable when attempting to balance. (It may become unstable after a trim balance because other problems tend to become more dominant.) A good indication of unbalance is that the phase difference between inboard horizontal (IBH) and outboard horizontal (OBH) should equal the phase difference between inboard vertical (IBV) and outboard vertical (OBV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase errors drastically affect balancing. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 7.5 degrees may produce an 8:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 15 degrees may produce a 4:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 30 degrees may produce a 2:1 vibration reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A phase error of 60 degrees or more may produce no reduction in vibration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Balancing Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All rotors regardless of their diameter/width (D/W) ratio should be balanced in two planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, on overhung rotors, if vibration in the bearing nearest the overhung mass has an amplitude of approximately four times the vibration in the other bearing, single-plane balancing may work. Overhung rotors with a D/W ratio of 4:1 or more may sometimes be balanced within the tolerance by a single-plane balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, sometimes narrow overhung rotors don&amp;#39;t respond well to two-plane balancing. On overhung narrow rotors, it becomes more difficult to separate the influence of the two weight planes on the two measurement planes. This is simply because narrow rotor weight planes are in close proximity to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To determine if a two-plane balance job is needed, set up and take four measurements but enter only one correction plane (single plane). Ask the program for estimated reductions. If the estimates are within tolerance, continue with a single-plane balance. If the estimated reduction is out of tolerance, change the setup to two correction planes and continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Indications of Rotor Unbalance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The time waveform should contain a strong sine wave component. Acceleration measurements distort the time waveform because higher frequencies are amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steady phase and steady amplitude are also requirements for balancing. If either is not steady, don&amp;#39;t diagnose the problem as unbalance. Sometimes it may be wise to make vibration measurements and then shut down the machine. Start the machine again and see if the vibration and phase measurements can be duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Selecting a Proper Trial Weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper trial weight (TW) selection is important because a weight that is too light may not provide an adequate response for calculating correction weights and placement. A trial weight that is too large may wreck the machine. Trial weights should adhere to the 30/30 rule: change the phase by 30 degrees or the amplitude by at least 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Calculating Trial Weights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = Rotor weight &amp;times; 10 percent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = (1.77) &amp;times; (TW) &amp;times; (R) &amp;times; (rpm &amp;divide; 1,000)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where: F = Force in pounds, TW = Trial weight in ounces, R = Radius in inches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Example: 5,400-pound rotor, 1,800 rpm, 13.5-inch radius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	F = 5,400 &amp;times; 10 percent; F = 540&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	540 = (1.77) x (TW) x (13.5) x (3.24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	540 = 77.4 TW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TW = 6.98 ounces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Typical Single-Plane Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set up equipment on the rotor as outlined by the balance equipment manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make &amp;quot;reference run&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;calibration run,&amp;quot; measuring vibration and phase.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trial weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add correction weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trim run.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trim weight if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make no more than two trim runs. If more than two trim runs are needed to achieve the standard, leave all weights in place, erase the data collected on this balance job and begin the process anew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Typical Two-Plane Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set up equipment on the rotor as outlined by the balance equipment manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make &amp;quot;reference run&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;calibration run,&amp;quot; measuring vibration and phase.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add trial weight to plane #1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run #1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight from plane #1 and place on plane #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trial run #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove trial weight from plane #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add correction weights to planes #1 and #2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make trim run and add trim weights if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make no more than two trim runs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If balance job is not within specs after two trim runs, leave weights in place, erase the data collected on this balance job and begin the process anew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When rotors won&amp;#39;t stay in balance, the following problems should be suspected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermal sensitivity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operating near a resonance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotor erosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Material buildup&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speed changes bringing the machine into a resonance condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loose rotor part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mindset of &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a fan and it shakes so it must need balancing,&amp;quot; is referred to as the balancing syndrome and can get you into trouble. Here are some tips that will help you avoid such pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The time signal should not be too distorted from sinusoidal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The shaft speed vibration amplitude should be steady and repeatable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The phase should be steady and repeatable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No more than three harmonics of shaft speed should be present in the spectrum. (Plain bearings may be an exception.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There should be no raised noise floor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No sub-harmonics should be present.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The rotor should be clean and free of buildup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Balancing should be the last corrective measure (correct obvious problems first).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rotors do not become unbalanced without a cause. If a rotor has been acceptably balanced and becomes unbalanced, always try to detect and correct the root cause of the unbalance. Sometimes rotor-reinforcing gussets may crack, allowing the rotor to deform and resulting in a sudden unbalance. If the rotor is rebalanced without repairing the cracks, sudden and catastrophic machine failure may occur if the gussets fail completely. Such problems can usually be avoided by performing a thorough cleaning and inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration is measured in displacement, velocity and acceleration. Velocity and acceleration are generally the most often used units, but when you balance rotors, you usually use displacement measured in mils. This is because displacement gives the best indication at low frequencies, and you are dealing with 1&amp;times; shaft speed when balancing. The technician needs to be aware that 1 mil of vibration on a machine running at 900 rpm is not comparable to 1 mil of vibration on a machine operating at 3,600 rpm. There is considerably more force exerted on the 3,600 rpm machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Why a Balance Job Goes Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The top causes for failing to achieve the required standard when balancing include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A mistake in setting up the data collector/analyzer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failing to remove a trial weight&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A problem that is not unbalance (usually looseness)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Entering the trial weight location incorrectly into the balancing instrument&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overhung load requiring two-plane balance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Weight placement not in the proper direction with relation to the rotor direction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Existing resonant condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Becoming proficient at rotor balancing requires having good tools and being knowledgeable in their use. A fundamental knowledge of balancing theory and balancing procedures is also critical for success. Having a good grasp of vibration analysis will help to ensure that the technician performs balancing only when the problem is unbalance. Because of many variables, there remains some art to balancing. With better tools and an improved knowledge, base balancing has become less of an art and more of an applied science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/alignment_and_balancing/~4/EcteUxTnZ7M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ludeca Unveils New Sensor System for Machinery Alignment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/10/30/ad949132-0305-4a73-afa1-2c3b52d154a6_Ludeca_Sensalign-Sensors.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 235px; float: left;" /&gt;Ludeca recently launched a new intelligent sensor system for machinery alignment. SensAlign combines patented sensor technology into the Rotalign Ultra iS platform to yield instantaneous data acquisition and real-time results with guaranteed 100-percent accuracy under even the roughest of field conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SensAlign intelligence automatically considers the effects of ambient vibration, acceleration of rotation, backlash, speed of rotation and other factors in determining the quality factor (QF) of alignment readings. This makes the system ideal for long-term stand-alone monitoring of machine positional change as well as routine everyday shaft alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An improved user-friendly interface enables the Rotalign Ultra iS to be faster while still collecting thousands of measurement points with its patented Continuous IntelliSweep method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alignment results can be achieved with the Rotalign Ultra iS in three easy steps: enter dimensions, measure and view results. The accurate alignments can reduce unwanted maintenance costs, power consumption and vibration levels while increasing equipment availability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ceramic bearings designed for the food processing industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings has introduced&amp;nbsp;its new and expanded line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and specialty lubricates specifically designed for the food processing and food packaging industries. Some of the most pressing issues facing the food manufacturing industry today are controlling costs and food safety. Full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings are capable of alleviating some of these concerns. Ceramic balls are far more efficient than steel balls because the rolling surface is more spherically perfect and therefore reduces friction. Companies that converted to ceramic bearings have seen a decrease of energy consumption and were therefore able to cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ceramic in ball form is twice the Rockwell hardness of steel which results in a more durable and longer lasting bearing. Boca Bearings line of full ceramic and ceramic hybrid bearings are appropriate for use in food packaging and food processing due to their ability to work in challenging conditions. Ceramic materials can operate in extreme temperatures, work with heavy loads and will not corrode or rust when exposed to water, alkali or acids, as might be customary during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings also offers a line of traditional lubrication, solid lubrication and dry lubrication that are FDA approved for food manufacturing facilities. For example Boca&amp;rsquo;s exclusive Ultra Dry Lube (UDL) is an extensively modified Lamellar composition that adds less than half a micron to any metal substrate. UDL molecularly bonds to most materials and is inorganic, non-toxic, non-corrosive and resistant to most fuels, solvents and acids present in food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further Boca Bearings offers the Lightning Solid Lube (LSL) line of solid Polyethylene and Graphite lubricants. LSL Poly lube, available in food grade and non food grade, is excellent for continuous operating temperatures up to 93&amp;deg;C (200&amp;deg;F) that can drastically increase bearing life and eliminate dripping oil or grease. LSL Graphite lube can be used in extreme operating temperatures from -157&amp;deg;C (-250 &amp;deg;F) to 349&amp;deg;C (660&amp;deg;F); Graphite Lube is insoluble in most organic solutions and will not wash out in water, steam or chemical wash down procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to laser align rotating shafts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video shows how to laser shaft align rotating shafts as quickly as possible with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;True Position Sensing&amp;quot;, available on the Fixturlaser XA and the Fixturlaser GO. Laser shaft alignment with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s dual laser, dual sensor design means the system tracks the shafts&amp;#39; true positions, allowing alignments to often be completed with just one set of measurements and adjustments. The XA and GO laser shaft alignment tools are available in the United States from VibrAlign Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ASQ accepting nominations for social responsibility medal</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The American Society for Quality (ASQ), the world&amp;rsquo;s largest network of quality resources and experts, is now accepting nominations for the 2010 &lt;a href="http://www.asq.org/about-asq/awards/hutchens.html"&gt;Spencer Hutchens Jr. Medal for Social Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. The medal &amp;ndash; which was created in 2009 &amp;ndash; recognizes the achievements of an individual who demonstrates outstanding leadership as an individual, business leader and cause advocate for social responsibility &amp;ndash; primarily focusing on the marketplace, environment, workplace and community. The Social Responsibility Medal is one of 13 global medals offered by ASQ each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The medal is named after Spencer Hutchens Jr., Los Angeles, Calif., an ASQ past president, whose personal and business life reflects and demonstrates the desired attributes in the definition and model of social responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This medal strengthens and reflects ASQ&amp;rsquo;s commitment to social responsibility, and to providing solutions that will help organizations meet their social responsibility goals,&amp;rdquo; said Hutchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Spencer Hutchens Jr. Social Responsibility Medal is presented annually at &lt;a href="http://wcqi.asq.org/" target="_blank"&gt;ASQ&amp;rsquo;s World Conference on Quality and Improvemen.&lt;/a&gt; Eligibility information and nomination forms are available at &lt;a href="http://www.asq.org/about-asq/awards/hutchens.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.asq.org/about-asq/awards/hutchens.html&lt;/a&gt;. All nominations are due by October 1, 2010. For more information, contact Karen Prosser, award program administrator, at &lt;a href="mailto:kprosser@asq.org"&gt;kprosser@asq.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SRO Initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As part of its growing effort to assume a leadership role locally and internationally in the SR movement, ASQ has created the Socially Responsible Organization (SRO) initiative. The SRO initiative is focused on helping the world understand the value of social responsibility and the critical role of quality to achieve results. By positively contributing to operations that are social, cultural, economic, and environmental, socially responsible organizations can use quality practices to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ASQ also developed &lt;a href="http://www.thesro.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.TheSRO.org&lt;/a&gt;, a free public website, to facilitate a dialogue about the importance of integrating quality and SR. It has created a community of thought leaders to share insights and expertise on, and examples of, the evolving area of SR. Social responsibility is an ideology. Quality is the methodology to achieve sustainability and measure impact from existing organizational strategies, systems, practices and processes. For additional information about the Social Responsibility program, contact Sarah Tillmar at &lt;a href="mailto:stillmar@asq.org"&gt;stillmar@asq.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to achieve vertical shaft plumbness using laser alignment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Traditionally, plumbness measurements on a vertical hydro-turbine/generator shaft involved stringing a series of wires along the length of the shaft, attaching a weight to the end of the wires and then measuring the space from the wire to the shaft using an electronic micrometer. Although this method was inexpensive and has been used for many years, it did require access to a long length of the shaft to achieve an accurate resolution. Also, measurements involve physically measuring the distance between the wire and the shaft at various elevations on the shaft, increasing the amount of time and personnel requirement for the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ludeca Inc. presents its experience with a laser-based system which replaces the time-consuming wire method. Measurements now can be performed in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take with the wire measurement method. Ludeca&amp;rsquo;s measurement system, known as the PERMAPLUMB, uses a self-adjusting mechanical mirror, always plumb to earth, that reflects a Class 1 laser beam into a detector. It requires only 14 inches of axial space along the shaft. The mirror and transducer are attached by a bracket that uses magnets on the turbine shaft. From a single 270-degree shaft rotation, the system calculates and displays angularity and corrective moves and provides a statistical quality measurement of the data. A &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; function allows monitoring of corrections as they are being made. The resolution is better than 0.00002 inch per foot, which is more accurate than required by NEMA. Adjacent turbines also can continue to operate since the system is insensitive to vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Plumbness is the relationship of a rotating centerline to gravity. It can be thought of as the verticality of a centerline. In practice, with vertical hydro shaft measurement, it is actually &amp;ldquo;un-plumbness&amp;rdquo; that is being measured, since the factor quantified is the difference from perfectly vertical as shown in Figure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Shaft Centerline of Rotation in Relationship to the Plumb Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plumbness is expressed as an angle. Since the angle is small, an angular slope, or rate of change, is a more appropriate form of expression than degrees or radians. The most common unit of expression for this parameter in relation to vertical hydro shafts is thousandths of an inch per foot or thousandths of an inch per inch. Plumbness is measured in two planes. If you were looking down on the shaft, the two planes of measurements would be the zero-to-180-degree plane and the 90-to-270-degree plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Achieving plumbness in vertical hydro shaft applications is essential for proper operation. Precision plumbness helps reduce bearing temperatures, reduces shaft movement, reduces vibration and improves efficiency. From a scheduling perspective, achieving this accurately in the least amount of time is essential in saving money.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Measuring Plumbness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In measuring plumbness, various methods exist, including the use of tight-wires, lasers and optics. The tight-wire is the most commonly used method and it is also the least expensive method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four tight-wires are strung vertically along the length of the vertical hydro shaft. Typically, a non-magnetic stainless steel variety is used that is 0.020 to 0.030 inch in diameter. To ensure a minimum required range on the micrometer, the wires are placed approximately equidistant from the shaft. Each wire is spaced at 90-degree intervals from each other around the hydro shaft. A finned weight of 20 to 30 pounds is suspended at the end of each wire where it is submerged in an oil bath to help dampen movement and vibration in the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An electric micrometer measures the distance between the hydro shaft and the wire. The wire and hydro shaft are electrically connected to each other in such a way as to complete an electrical circuit when the micrometer makes contact. This, in turn, activates an electronic auditory tone that lets the user know when to stop advancing the micrometer. Readings are taken at points along the shaft to establish the relative position between the tight-wire and the hydro shaft as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 2. Tight-wire Plumbness Measurement Concept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tight-wire method excels in being low cost and having a rather intuitive setup. However, it is a measurement where &amp;ldquo;attention to detail&amp;rdquo; is paramount in reducing the error involved in the measurement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to ensure that vibration be virtually non-existent during the measurement process. Disturbances of the tight-wire during measurement will distort the accuracy of the readings. In some cases, neighboring hydro units are kept in operation while the measurement process is being performed. If the units were forced to be shut down for the sake of the measurement process, lost revenue from the operation of those turbines would result. Additionally, chances increase for the wire to be physically disturbed when other projects are being performed near the vicinity of the measurement, particularly during a repair or overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The technician must be careful that the measurement is performed consistently and accurately. It is assumed that the surface being measured is of high quality and that it is representative of concentricity of the shaft or coupling. Shaft out-of-roundness, pits, rust or grime can affect the accuracy of the reading. Variations of the micrometer reading can vary from person to person depending on when they stop advancing the micrometer to touch the tight-wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accuracy in tight-wire readings increases when a greater axial length is measured. This means it is desirable to string the tight-wire to the longest distance that can be achieved. This also means that more of the shaft is dedicated to the measurement procedure. Consequently, the micrometer operator must travel farther distances to measurement points up and down the length of the shaft, or additional operators must be employed. Once the readings are taken, data needs to be recorded accurately by the operator or the person in charge of evaluating the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is apparent that there are many factors involved in tight-wire measurements that can induce error strictly from the measurement process as well as in prolonging the amount of time and space needed to take the measurements. To achieve an increase in productivity, it is necessary to reduce the human element from the measurement process, reduce the amount of area needed to be measured on the shaft, and reduce the amount of time required to obtain measurements and perform corrections.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Laser-Based Plumbness Measurement Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The PERMAPLUMB system is a laser-based plumbness measurement tool. It circumvents a great number of the limitations of the tight-wire method by removing the human element from the measurement process through the use of a laser and a computer for data acquisition. This helps to ensure that the accuracy of the measurements is not user dependent. In addition, the PERMAPLUMB system offers a measurement resolution an entire order of magnitude better than that obtainable with the tightwire/micrometer method. The system also sets up easily and gives alignment readings quickly on demand, reducing the amount of time dedicated to the measurement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of a laser and mirror mounted on a compact magnetic bracket that is only 14 inches long, as shown in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 3. The PERMAPLUMB and 14-inch Bracket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The laser transducer is mounted upon the bracket as shown in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 4. Laser Transducer Mounted upon the Permaplumb Bracket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A beam is reflected off a self-leveling mirror on the bottom of the bracket back into a 1-micron-resolution detector located inside the laser transducer. The mirror&amp;rsquo;s two-axis pivot points ensure that the mirror&amp;rsquo;s surface will always maintain relative plumbness to the horizon, as shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 5. Self-adjusting Mirror Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Plumbness is measured by simply attaching the system to the vertical shaft by means of its integrated magnetic feet and rotating the shaft to four positions 90 degrees apart as shown in Figure 6. A measurement is taken at each of the 90-degree positions. After the last measurement is taken, the plumbness results can be displayed through the computer. Correcting plumbness is usually done in one of two ways: axially moving (shimming) the thrust bearing or translating (horizontally moving) the thrust bearing. PERMAPLUMB will provide you with correction values and a live &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; function with which to monitor corrections in real time for either (or both) of these two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 6. Attaching the PERMAPLUMB to the Hydro Shaft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Using PERMAPLUMB for Vertical Hydro Shaft Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The PERMAPLUMB system can readily be integrated into procedures that require vertical shaft plumbness measurements. Because the shaft will be rotated, it is necessary to take into account factors that will ensure no obstructions or interferences during the rotation. This includes backing off any adjustable bearing shoes so that the shaft may be rotated without any rubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standard checks and safety procedures always should be performed prior to the measurement process. Such checks include ensuring that no &amp;ldquo;dog leg&amp;rdquo; or run-out exists in the shaft. Dial indicators or proximity probes can be mounted at various positions along the shaft to quickly determine if such problems exist and if they need to be addressed prior to and/or after the plumbness measurements and corrections. Proximity probes achieve high accuracies and are less susceptible to shaft surface finish inaccuracies than dial indicators. Data can be acquired in one turn of the shaft, thereby speeding up the process of correcting and detecting &amp;ldquo;dog leg&amp;rdquo; and run-out issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The equal loading of all of the pads of the thrust bearing needs to be ensured. Various procedures exist depending upon the type of thrust bearing that is being used. Methods range from the &amp;ldquo;slugged arc&amp;rdquo; method to the more advanced and time-saving method of integrating load cells into the adjustable shoes. In most cases, plumbing the shaft and equalizing the loads will go hand-in-hand between corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measurements begin by mounting the PERMAPLUMB system onto any area along the length of the hydro shaft. The easiest area to access would typically be the deck above the turbine, as shown in Figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 7. The PERMAPLUMB System Installed on the Hydro Shaft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system is then connected to a laptop computer and power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dimensions and parameters are entered into the WinPLUMB software package. Such dimensions include the thrust bearing data to make corrections on the thrust bearing, translation data to monitor the shaft position at the upper and lower guide bearings, and tolerances to help determine when the shaft is plumbed to tolerance, as shown in Figure 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8. Entering Dimensions, Tolerances and Targets into the WinPLUMB Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the dimensions are entered, it is time to take the measurements. This begins by turning on the high-pressure lubrication system and having the mounted PERMAPLUMB system on the shaft rotated to the designated &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; degree position. The high-pressure lubrication system is then deactivated to let the shaft settle down. This is where the first measurement point will be taken. The high-pressure lubrication system is then reactivated and the process is repeated for the next three points over 270 degrees of shaft rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results achieved (see Figure 9) will display the plumbness results in mils per inch. The NEMA tolerance of 0.25 mils per foot is entered (as 0.0208 mils per inch) into the tolerance function so that the system can indicate if the tolerance was achieved. The measurement resolution is better than 0.00002 inch per foot, which is far better than the tolerance required by NEMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 9. The Results Screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Should corrections be required on the thrust bearing pads, PERMAPLUMB provides the amount each pad should be moved up (or down) to achieve tolerance, as shown in Figure 10. A special feature in the software also allows for &amp;ldquo;Pad Up &amp;amp; Down&amp;rdquo;, which yields optimized corrections for adding and subtracting to the pad height in order to achieve plumbness without changing the shaft elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 10. Thrust Bearing Corrections for Each Shoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corrections on the pads are performed and the shaft is remeasured to verify plumbness. The whole process can be measured &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;, if needed. A special &amp;ldquo;live move&amp;rdquo; mode is activated to continuously update the hydro shaft&amp;rsquo;s plumbness condition as corrections are being made, as shown in Figure 11. This not only updates the actual plumbness value, but continuously updates the predicted thrust bearing pad corrections as well as the shaft position change at the upper and lower guide bearings. Plumbness is able to be continuously monitored for situations in which the thrust bearing itself may need to be translated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;live move&amp;rdquo; mode is particularly useful in ensuring that corrections are made without interference during the move. Should the shaft contact the guide bearings or become obstructed during the repositioning, this would become evident in this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/LudecaImages081910.pdf"&gt;Figure 11. &amp;ldquo;Live Move&amp;rdquo; Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assurance of measurement accuracy during the measurement process is vital. Data collected needs to be relied upon to perform corrections and verify results. During the data collection process, a sample of 32 readings per second can be collected per measurement point. The user can select how many seconds of data are to be collected per measurement point, up to 204 seconds. This is extremely useful when vibration could become an issue during measurement, which is usually the case when adjacent turbines are running during the measurement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;standard deviation&amp;rdquo; display ensures that the measurement duration selected creates stable data to overcome vibration issues. This is useful in finding the optimum amount of time required for data collection to create a stable measurement while reducing measurement time to the minimum possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measurement accuracy also is ensured through rotation to four points. A special feature known as &amp;ldquo;circular completion&amp;rdquo; ensures that the hydro shaft is rotated about an axis with zero interference. It ensures that readings at the four points follow the equation that the sum of the zero-degree and 180-degree readings should equal the sum of the 90- and 270-degree readings. If that equation is violated during measurement, a circular completion error will result showing the degree to which this violation occurs. A value of 0.2 in the raw detector data or less would be considered a good reading. This feature indicates if shaft interference issues have occurred during measurement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Repeatability of the measurement is essential as a standard measurement process. PERMAPLUMB features a repeatability function to allow for previous measurements to be compared to the current measurements. Repeatable measurements ensure that &amp;ldquo;what you see is what it really is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Repeatability checks with the PERMAPLUMB also can be used to verify shaft rigidity. A perfectly rigid shaft will create identical plumbness readings with the PERMAPLUMB no matter where the system is mounted on the hydro shaft. Rigidity can be inspected between two shafts that are connected by a solid coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, we describe how this is done: Plumbness is measured below the coupling at least twice to establish repeatability. Plumbness is then measured above the coupling, again twice to ensure repeatability. The results between the measurements taken above and below the coupling are then compared to establish rigidity. Any difference in the results of greater than 0.004 mils per inch would be considered a lack of rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ability to perform a plumbness measurement in the least amount of time with a high degree of accuracy benefits in both the short term, with improved time savings, and the long term, with improved service life and efficiency. Quick setup, reliability, immunity to vibration, accuracy and time savings are all factors that make the PERMAPLUMB system ideal for plumbness measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 steps to diagnose a soft foot condition on machinery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis can be used to determine if a soft foot condition exists on a machine that is running. If you cannot shut the machine down to check for soft foot, using the simple procedure outlined in this article will help determine if soft foot is your problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mount your accelerometer on the suspected soft foot.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the live monitoring mode of your vibration analyzer to monitor the 1x rotation speed vibration. Use enough resolution to distinguish the desired peak, but not so much that it requires long collection time between averages.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While monitoring the 1x vibration, loosen the mounting bolt to approximately hand-tight.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the vibration at 1x rotational speed reduces significantly in amplitude, it is very likely that you have a soft foot condition.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Retighten the mounting bolt and schedule the appropriate corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When corrections are not made to eliminate a soft foot condition, the foot will deflect when tightened. This will affect the alignment and the motor air gap, and can cause significant vibration at rotational speed. By loosening the foot while running, the force deflecting the foot is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/alignment_and_balancing/~4/FubOLhqrgCQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>A checklist for alignment and soft foot</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Several points should be checked prior to laser alignment in order to avoid problems later and to achieve good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep the following in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Foundation: &lt;/strong&gt;A solid, rigid foundation is essential for a successful alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Machine mobility:&lt;/strong&gt; It is advisable to set both machines with about 80 mils of shims underneath the feet in case one machine needs to be lowered. Also, jacking bolts provide a safer and more accurate way to make horizontal moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rigid couplings: &lt;/strong&gt;These must be loosened to achieve accurate readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coupling play: &lt;/strong&gt;This can be avoided by turning the shafts a few degrees before starting measurements and then taking readings in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bearing play: &lt;/strong&gt;Check for excessive bearing play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Soft foot: &lt;/strong&gt;Check for soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soft foot can severely affect the operating condition of a machine, which will undoubtedly shorten its life expectancy. Here are a few simple tips to help avoid soft foot in your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate rust, dirt and any other contamination from the contact surfaces of the machine feet, shims and frame or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Never insert more than four shims at a time beneath a single machine foot. More than three shims may cause a spring effect.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate external forces on the machine such as those from connected piping, conduit, auxiliary supports, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use high-quality, clean and uniform shims when shimming is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>Robots help pancake maker improve productivity, hygiene</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ABB&amp;rsquo;s robotic technology has helped transform the production of pancakes at the Honeytop Speciality Food Ltd. plant in the United Kingdom by the installation of two lines, each utilizing four FlexPicker IRB 360 robots for the picking and stacking of pancakes. The solution &amp;ndash; designed, built and installed by ABB&amp;rsquo;s channel partner, RG Luma &amp;ndash; ensures the company can meet its own stringent requirements for the hygienic handling of food, as well as introducing reduced labor costs, and improved health and safety levels at the 120,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honeytop Speciality Foods Ltd., the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s leading privately owned Naan bread producer and Europe&amp;rsquo;s leading volume manufacturer of specialty flatbreads, produces more than 100,000 artisanal breads an hour. Recognizing the need to improve productivity, the food specialist approached RG Luma &amp;ndash; suppliers of industrial automation, special-purpose machines and robotic integration &amp;ndash; with the requirement for new automated production lines to help improve hygienic conditions at the plant and increase flexibility for the production of pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The demands of the industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we first began talks with RG Luma regarding this production line, we had some reservations about the robots and whether they could help introduce the flexibility and reliability we needed,&amp;rdquo; said William Eid, director for Honeytop Speciality Foods Ltd. &amp;ldquo;We work in an industry with very tight turnaround times. We receive daily orders that are expected to be out to the depots within 12 hours of production. We needed to improve productivity, hygienic standards and increase the speed of the production line to meet these industry demands, all while reducing downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picked and stacked by IRB 360 FlexPickers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By working closely with RG Luma, Honeytop Speciality Foods outlined the range of products required for production. The answer was to introduce flexibility, speed and quality with four FlexPicker robots, capable of handling 110 picks per minute to ensure all pancakes are picked and stacked quickly and precisely.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Forming part of a bigger solution for Honeytop Speciality Foods Ltd., the FlexPicker robots are connected, via conveyor belts, to a stand-alone, automated hot plate production line that produces large quantities of batter-based products, including light and fluffy American pancakes. The conveyor belt operates in a waterfall pattern, helping reduce the pancakes to room temperature following cooking, before preparing them for stacking and packing.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	All pancakes are manually checked before entering the robot enclosure, where the pancakes are picked and stacked in piles (of selectable height dependant on product) onto one central outfeed conveyor.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robotic load sharing system and buffer implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The enclosure is split into four areas of operation, enabling the robots to operate in alternative areas to the preceding robot on the line. The result is four ABB FlexPicker robots, evenly spaced out, each manning one section of the conveyor. This load-sharing system comes complete with a buffer system, designed by RG Luma, to enable the robots to keep pancakes on the buffer shelve until a short stack is identified. This buffer system also helps to reduce waste levels as the right stack of products is produced on the central outfeed conveyor.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABB&amp;rsquo;s proven software technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Complementing the FlexPickers is ABB&amp;rsquo;s proven PickMaster 3.2 software and its IRC5 controller. ABB&amp;rsquo;s PickMaster 3.2 software offers greatly simplified programming, enabling users to model for applications and optimize multiple robot installations. For Honeytop, the use of the PickMaster 3.2 helps monitor progress on the line, including the total number of picks and can be used to quickly change production from one product to another. RG Luma has also created a secondary control system to work alongside ABB PickMaster 3.2 to vary the outfeed conveyor speed to prevent short stacks or overflows.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A major breakthrough in vision software technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Integrated with the PickMaster 3.2 software are four-gigabit Ethernet cameras. These are mounted in front of each robot and used to locate each pancake&amp;rsquo;s position on the conveyor. The robots then track the pancake position and accurately pick it and place it onto the central conveyor. RG Luma configured the vision software to recognize overlapping product and, for the first time ever, FlexPickers are able to pick a product overlapped on top of another one.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The final step of the production line requires the products to be checked again by manual operators before entering Honeytop&amp;rsquo;s automated packing and labelling machine, provided by Fuji Machinery Ltd.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realization of the benefits and ROI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Speaking about the final solution, Eid stated, &amp;ldquo;This is our first investment in robotic automated technology, and despite some apprehension, we have not experienced one issue since the installation over six months ago. Turnaround time has been dramatically reduced between products and, as a result, we can meet our customer&amp;rsquo;s tight deadlines without delay. The robots have already enabled us to absorb a number of overheads, thanks to low labor costs and improved productivity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience and proven products are key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The directors at Honeytop did express some apprehension about introducing robotics,&amp;rdquo; said Andrew Jones, sales director at RG Luma. &amp;ldquo;Having integrated over 25 ABB robots in the past 12 months, we were confident in continuing to use such proven products, and I think both William and his team could see how radical improvements would be possible with this change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Each of Honeytop&amp;rsquo;s final production lines feature four IRB360 robots, ABB&amp;rsquo;s PickMaster 3.2 software and four IRC5 controllers. The built-in versatility of the production line has dramatically cut the changeover time between products, making it easier for Honeytop to meet its deadlines with high-quality products every time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tips to predict bearing failures, measure lube film thickness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, there are two options of maintenance concerning electric motor bearings. One is to relubricate them and the other is to change them. Monitoring electric motor bearing condition is paramount to insure reliability. Electric motors are an asset that must be managed, and prolonging their life will insure more contribution to the bottom-line profit. Preventing collateral damage caused by electric motor bearing failure is true cost avoidance. There are several ways to monitor and measure bearing condition &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; ultrasonics, temperature, vibration analysis and shock pulse, just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because lubrication is the first line of defense for prolonging bearing life, it is imperative that the lubrication film thickness between the rolling elements and the raceways be measured and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubrication film thickness: What matters&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lubrication is the vital element between any moving parts and an absolute requirement in rolling element bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There has always been much discussion and debate regarding the questions of how much, how often and what kinds of lubricants should be used in rolling element bearings; and to many, it still remains a mystery. The following chart (Figure 1) indicates the many parameters related to the lubrication film thickness and film quality in a rolling element bearing. Even &amp;ldquo;sealed for life&amp;rdquo; bearings will lose their lubrication film thickness. Knowing how much lubricant is left in a sealed bearing can make the difference between productive uptime and unscheduled downtime. Knowing if lubricant is getting into the bearing will allow maintenance to maximize bearing life by optimizing oil film thickness and unscheduled downtime can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Differentiating between bearing surface damage and lubrication film thickness, as a bearing fault, is a measurable function. Knowing the difference is valuable knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="366" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps001.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case study No. 1: Maxim Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scrubber for cleaning contaminated water before dispersing into the waste water system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Four small 3/4-horsepower motors with integral &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; face mounted impeller pumps plumbed with PVC piping.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All four motors are running at the same time. (Figure 2.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After demonstrating how to monitor bearing condition and measure lubrication film thickness at this printed circuit manufacturing plant, we were asked to look at a small water scrubber. The screaming sound of a bad bearing could be heard, but they could not pinpoint which bearing was making the noise. Was it the drive end or opposite drive end of which motor? After a quick check, the bearing was identified and its condition was determined. This was a 6204.2RS sealed bearing (a sealed-for-life bearing). The cost was about $9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We left the plant with the promise to provide a quotation for a portable data logger instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the night, the bearing froze up and tripped the motor, so only three motors were now running. They lost one-fourth of the capacity of the system to clean water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day (before the repair could be made), the Bay Area Environmental Protection Agency inspector showed up. Water was still being dumped into the wastewater system. Because of the lessened capacity, when the water was tested, it did not meet the cleaned requirements. The fine was $32,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sad part is that they knew which bearing was bad. They also knew how bad it was. If predictive maintenance or condition monitoring was a part of their normal operating procedures, this downtime and fine would have never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="242" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps002.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 2: Electric motor shop at Laprino Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 700-horsepower ABB electric motor for driving a fan for dehydrating milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB motors have long recommended the use of shock pulse to measure their motor bearings. Many ABB motors are equipped at the factory with SPM adapters for quick-connect measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ABB motor was installed at Laprino Foods and failed within the warranty period. The bearing froze up and twisted the shaft. There was no lubrication in the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After careful review, the records showed that the maintenance personnel in the plant had indeed greased the bearing according to the recommended schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seal cap was removed from the end bell of the drive end exposing the bearing for inspection. It was found that a machining error was made during manufacture and the grease pathway from the grease zerk to the bearing lubrication notch did not line up. Grease could not get into the bearing. Even though the lubrication schedule was being adhered to, the bearing was not being measured, so no one could tell if lubricant was actually getting into the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production was interrupted so a new motor was taken from the electric motor shop&amp;rsquo;s inventory to replace the damaged motor. Before installing the new motor, a test run was performed. While the motor was running, a measurement was taken while lubricant (grease) was applied to the zerk. Without disassembling the motor or causing an intrusive action, it was determined that the grease pathway was in the correct place and lubricant was truly getting into the bearing. The bearing&amp;rsquo;s true condition was determined and the lubricant film thickness was measured and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB honored the warranty. The damaged motor was repaired and stored for a spare and the new motor is still running today. An online monitoring system (MG-4) continues to monitor these ABB electric motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="312" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps003.jpg" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 3: Evanite Fiber Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 125-horsepower motor and belt drive on an exhaust fan for a spun glass process used to make high-density filters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This example was not necessarily on the motor, but on the fan shaft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common bearing installation faults that affects lubrication film thickness is the installation and set-up of the tapered bore, double-row spherical roller bearing using a split tapered adapter in a mounted unit (i.e. pillow block bearing). While this is not an electric motor bearing,it is in very close proximity to every drive motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tapered adapter is used as a wedge device to hold the inter race of the bearing on to the shaft. All bearing manufacturers have recommended clearances for applying this type of bearing. This type of bearing in a pillow block housing is very common on larger fan applications and is a very popular style for many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="243" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps004.jpg" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the tapered sleeve (adapter) is drawn up too far by over-tightening the spanner nut (a very common practice), the internal clearance of the bearing will be removed, thus reducing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though these bearings are running with no apparent fault or vibration alarm, the reliability of the machine has been put into jeopardy because the operator cannot see the film thickness problem. Lubrication film thickness can be measured to determine the true condition of the bearing during start-up without setting a baseline and treading. Differentiating bearing surface damage faults and lubrication film thickness faults is powerful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 4: Superior Lumber Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25-horsepower motor driving an edger in a sawmill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standard foot mounted motors that are mounted in the vertical position must have special consideration related to lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The normally mounted bearing in a horizontal motor is supporting load/overhung load in the radical direction. If the motor is mounted in the vertical position, the bearing will see more thrust loads and the lubrication will run out through the opening of an open or shielded bearing. A sealed bearing will hold the lubricant reservoir in the lower half of the bearing because the bearing is lying on its side in this application. This position will also force all of the balls of a ball bearing to one side of the raceway, thus placing them all in a more loaded situation in both radial and thrust directions. Load affects the lubrication film thickness. Normally, a motor mounted in this position will need lubricating more often than what is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The ability to measure the lubrication film thickness is paramount. Better asset management and machine reliability can be obtained by measuring the film thickness as soon as the machine is turned on. This will prolong bearing and machine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is critical. It can be measured to detect and troubleshoot for proper lubrication amounts (over/under), the right kind of lubricant for the right job, to detect installation faults and even to pinpoint the lack of film thickness if there is a compatibility and/or contamination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing the film thickness of lubrication in rolling element bearings, even a sealed bearing, is information worth measuring. Lubricant should only be applied to rolling element bearings because of demand requirements. Measuring the bearing film thickness before you lubricate will insure that there is truly a lubrication requirement. Automatic lubrication supply systems can provide the optimum amount of lubrication at just the right time when signaled by an online measuring system. Knowing the lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is instrumental in best asset management practices. Knowing what really matters in rolling element bearings to insure machine reliability is knowing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/alignment_and_balancing/~4/1SfkXA8h3KM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;SKF Maintenance Products, a division of the SKF Group, has extended its range of precision alignment tools with the introduction of the SKF shaft alignment tool TMEA 2, a laser-driven shaft alignment tool. Developed to further enhance plant efficiency and productivity, this addition to SKF's range of instruments will be welcomed in all industries where rotating machinery is used.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shaft misalignment is responsible for up to 50 percent&amp;nbsp;of rotating machinery breakdowns. These breakdowns increase unplanned machinery downtime, resulting in higher maintenance costs. Additionally, misaligned shafts can increase friction, resulting in higher energy consumption and can cause premature bearing failures. To this end, industries spend vast amounts each year to remedy the effects of misaligned shafts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Traditional alignment methods do not produce the high degree of accuracy required by today's precision machinery and are often time consuming. In contrast, SKF's new shaft alignment tool TMEA 2 combines pinpoint laser accuracy with simplicity of use.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Precision shaft alignment is possible</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;I am a shaft alignment trainer. My insight on the real state of industrial alignment practices comes from many hours spent making alignment checks and corrections on process equipment. Here are some of my observations: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of the attention to precision alignment has centered on large, process-critical machines. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most maintenance departments have been downsized and spend much of their human capital addressing unscheduled maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of the unscheduled maintenance activity is on small equipment such as ANSI pumps and mixers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most plants have very few people capable of achieving precision alignment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are even fewer people who really understand shaft alignment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most tradesmen are smart and can learn alignment in one or two days. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Shaft alignment of direct coupled machines can be done quickly without sacrificing precision. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_pg36.gif"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;Chart 1. Five simple steps to eliminate most unnecessary corrective moves. &lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;THINK SMALL &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Small, rotating machines are often badly aligned. I see terrible things: piles of coupling debris, spare coupling parts in the mechanical room, packing and seals leaking profusely, and misalignment so severe that it can be seen with the naked eye. No doubt, large machines are important, but they are rarely severely misaligned. Huge payback can result from aligning the many small machines that often fail catastrophically. How big can the payback be? A corn processor in the Midwest with a population of around 800 pumps used to repair two to three pumps every day. After focusing on small pump alignment, the site now repairs one to two per month and is saving more than 4,000 maintenance hours per year. That is equivalent to adding two people to the maintenance staff. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. Dimensions are entered. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WHY ALIGNMENT? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The objective of precision shaft alignment is to remove destructive forces that cause premature bearing failure and reduce seal life. Destructive misalignment forces are generated at the planes of power transmission when the machines are coupled. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Every shaft rotates around an axis that forms a straight line. If two shaft rotational axes are positioned so that they are collinear when the machines are at operating temperatures and conditions, the forces at the power planes will be minimal. As a result, bearing and seal life is lengthened. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;FIRST, PRE-ALIGNMENT &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can accomplish precision alignment in one or two moves virtually every time. Multiple alignment correction moves frustrate tradesmen and waste time. But, perform pre-alignment steps prior to using precision tools or your alignment corrections will be unpredictable. The box on Page 36 shows five simple steps that eliminate most unnecessary corrective moves. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. The measurement -12.4 shows the need to add .012 inches to the front feet; +9.7 means remove .010 inches from the rear feet. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;MEASURE MISALIGNMENT &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Laser sensors are affixed to the shafts on or near the couplings. Enter the dimensions from sensors to the coupling and to the machinery feet into the laser system (Figure 1). Most shaft alignment tolerances are based on revolutions per minute (RPM), so also enter that data. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rotate the shafts from 60 to 180 degrees to determine the vertical and horizontal position of the two rotational axes at the sensors. The laser system calculates the misalignment at the coupling (where the forces are generated) to determine the alignment quality. In this case, color guidance indicates that the alignment tolerances aren't satisfied. The laser also computes the vertical and horizontal positions at the machine feet because that is where adjustments can be made. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure3.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure4.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure5.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 3. Measure the misalignment. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONVENTIONAL APPROACH &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Conventional wisdom in shaft alignment is to completely solve the vertical misalignment first. Horizontal corrections are only undertaken after vertical tolerances are satisfied. What dismays many is that after making horizontal adjustments, the vertical tolerances are no longer satisfied. Therefore, after time has been spent to make a precise vertical alignment and after the horizontal alignment is made, the vertical will again require readjustment. This is because vertical misalignment affects the horizontal alignment and vice versa. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;A NEW APPROACH &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A compound move is a process where both the vertical and horizontal alignment is made from one set of alignment data. After measuring the misalignment, the vertical shim adjustment is performed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Before rechecking the vertical outcome and before the bolts are retightened, also make the horizontal alignment (Figures 4-5). Live correction data gives the operator feedback on the correction. Color guidance indicates when tolerances are satisfied. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Only then, after both vertical and horizontal corrections are made, should you retake the alignment data. By making compound vertical and horizontal corrections, you minimize the "cross effect". The first compound move should get you very close to tolerance in both planes. Consequently, repeating the procedure with a second compound move will result in a precise alignment virtually every time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;KEYS TO SUCCESS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here is my advice to you: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Think small for big results:&lt;/B&gt; Go after the small machines that steal your human resources. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Establish a core group:&lt;/B&gt; Find three people who are willing to share information and who are respected in your maintenance department. I haven't seen one really successful alignment program that doesn't have at least one "go to" person to help others with problem jobs. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Expect widespread alignment competence:&lt;/B&gt; If only one or two people can perform a satisfactory alignment, then only the critical machines will get aligned properly. There won't be enough alignment talent to get to the small machines. Every person involved in mechanical maintenance should be competent at machinery alignment. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Set alignment tolerances:&lt;/B&gt; Setting tolerances indicates you want to perform precision maintenance. Make the tolerances reasonable and achievable. If you make the specifications too tight, you'll only frustrate your people. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Train for competence:&lt;/B&gt; Find a competent trainer that teaches both alignment concepts and equipment-specific laser techniques. Hands-on practice is a key training element. Never have more than three people per practice rig. Two days of professional training should cost between $500 and $600 per trainee. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Tools:&lt;/B&gt; In addition to a laser system or dial indicator alignment tool, you need, at a minimum, shims, movers (hydraulic, pry bars, dead blow hammers) and a dial indicator with a magnetic base. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Give people opportunities and time to gain confidence:&lt;/B&gt; People need the real-world practice after training in order to gain confidence. Also, new trainees will need more time to make precision alignments. With the proper tools, a one coupling alignment rarely takes more than 45 minutes, regardless of equipment size. However, new trainees will be slower. Further, you need to realize that obstacles like being base-bound or bolt-bound will slow the process down. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Document alignment data:&lt;/B&gt; Correlate alignment to machinery performance and vibration data and use it for root cause failure analysis. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Thermal growth and dynamic movement:&lt;/B&gt; Some machines are intentionally misaligned at ambient temperature so that the rotational axes are collinear when the machine is operating. After your people can demonstrate alignment competence, consider determining the off-line-to-running (OL2R) data required for this practice.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure7.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200709_Applied_Reli-Figure7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Ludeca offers video on ULTRA laser alignment system</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Ludeca has made a new video available for the award-winning Rotalign ULTRA laser system.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;This video allows you to see the new features and benefits of the Rotalign ULTRA shaft alignment system with Continuous Sweep measurement mode, wireless Bluetooth communication to the sensor and a âSoft Foot Wizardâ that not only measures your soft foot condition but analyzes it and suggests a solution. Obtain alignment results in three easy steps: dimensions, measure and results.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The video demonstrates the unique under- and over-constrained alignment centerline capabilities of the ULTRA, as well as each of the add-on modules available for it. These include BORALIGN for measuring the alignment of bore centers in engines, compressors and pumps, LEVALIGN for the measurement of flatness of machine beds and other surfaces in 3-D and the STRAIGHTNESS module for measurement of roll profiles, guide rails and tracks. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
