<title>Servomotor with built-in screw drive is unique</title>
<link>http://www.drivesncontrols.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/5313/Servomotor_with_built-in_screw_drive_is__91unique_92.html</link>
<description>The German miniature servomotor specialist Wittenstein cyber motor has come up with a unique servomotor design which has a screw drive built into its housing. The motor, spindle drive, linear guide and encoder system form a ready-to-mount integrated linear actuator system suitable for use as a dynamic positioning axis, especially where space is limited. When combined with servo controls, the motors can form servo axes with multiple fieldbus interfaces.</description>

<title>NASA's glass gears have cracking potential</title>
<link>http://www.drivesncontrols.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/5302/NASA_s_glass_gears_have_cracking_potential.html</link>
<description>US researchers, led by scientists and engineers from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, are developing gears made out of special materials that that can act both as a metal and as a glass. The materials can operate efficiently without lubricants in extremely cold conditions, such as those found on the surface of planets and moons. They could also slash the cost of strain-wave gears used in applications such as robotics.</description>

<title>UK manufacturers aren't ready for new industrial revolution</title>
<link>http://www.drivesncontrols.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/5287/UK_manufacturers__91aren_t_ready_for_new_industrial_revolution_92.html</link>
<description>More than four in ten UK manufacturers (42%) say they have a good handle on what the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) will entail. But according to a new report from the manufacturers organisation, EEF, and Oracle, just one in ten (11%) believe that the UK is geared up for this crucial next industrial age. This suggests that in terms of being 4IR ready, there is still some way to go.</description>

<description>The German motion engineer Stober has developed what it claims is the worlds narrowest multi-axis servodrive. The modular, rack-based SI6 system includes double-axis modules (2 x 5A) that are 45mm wide, resulting in six-axis systems that are 18cm wide, and 20-axis systems that are less than 50cm wide, including power supplies. The drives have a position, speed and current cycle time of 62.5µs.</description>
