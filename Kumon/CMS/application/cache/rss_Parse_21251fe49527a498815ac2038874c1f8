            <title>GE Monitoring and Diagnostic Team Saves $70 Million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/26/e986f8ea-a380-495d-a77a-cb0aca4df874_GE-center.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 267px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;General Electric (GE) recently announced that operational data from its fleet of more than 1,500 gas turbine and generator assets translated to customer savings estimated at $70 million in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE&amp;#39;s monitoring and diagnostics center collects more than 30,000 operating hours of data every day and features a team of more than 50 engineers who analyze more than 35,000 operational alarms per year. Among the activities monitored at the center are the inlet temperature of a compressor, thermal performance of a gas turbine, temperature of combustion exhaust, dynamic tones of the combustion system, vibration levels of a rotor and the temperature of bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our monitoring and diagnostics team and capabilities play a key role in helping GE customers operate their power plants at high levels of performance and reliability,&amp;quot; said Justin Eggart of GE&amp;#39;s Power Generation Services business. &amp;quot;Our team takes a holistic approach to what we call &amp;#39;predictive maintenance,&amp;#39; which focuses on helping customers sidestep operational barriers before they occur, no matter what type of equipment they are managing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Drawing on the experience of hundreds of thousands of resolved cases, GE&amp;#39;s monitoring and diagnostics team has developed dozens of physics-based algorithms that provide early warning of more than 150 potential failure mechanisms. This wealth of understanding, blended with application of statistical methods, has enabled the team to continually improve the algorithms, thereby increasing the probability of detection while reducing false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2014, the monitoring and diagnostics center served 502 customer sites in 58 countries, providing assistance more than 8,000 times and helping power plant customers achieve their desired outcomes with reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have operational data flowing in continuously from the fleet, and we are in constant contact with our customer sites as well as our broader engineering teams,&amp;quot; added Eggart. &amp;quot;Oftentimes, the collaboration between our engineers and customers leads to the fastest and most complete resolution to the issue at hand, and we appreciate those interaction opportunities that our services enable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring and diagnostics center monitors technology and equipment not only from GE but also Nooter/Eriksen, Flowserve, Emerson, Delaval, Byron Jackson and others.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasound Detection: Predictive Maintenance for the Masses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The popularity of ultrasound inspection for maintenance and reliability managers is attributed to ease of use, versatility and low implementation cost. Once considered a companion to core predictive technologies like vibration analysis and infrared imaging, the emergence of standalone ultrasound inspection programs is more prevalent for reliability departments today. Ultrasound is now considered a front-line defense system in the everyday battle for manufacturing uptime. Airborne ultrasound is predictive maintenance for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mass Appeal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The applications in which ultrasonic technology can be used are nearly limitless, lending to its mass appeal. Compressed air leak detection, condition-based monitoring of bearings and acoustic lubrication of bearings are popular applications. Some inspectors monitor thousands of steam traps and pinpoint in-leakage to boilers, condensers and heat exchangers. Others marry ultrasonic inspection and infrared scanning together for added safety to motor control center panel scans or surveys of high-voltage substations and transmission and distribution lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Easy to Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound instruments have always been considered user friendly. Being painted this way left consumers with the impression that user-friendliness equated to lacking sophistication. Nothing could be further from the truth for the new generation of instruments. Inspectors can literally design their own instrument to suite their program&amp;#39;s needs and goals, and flexibly change that instrument as their program evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/2a683bc8-5013-44db-a77b-acf61c831247_1c.jpeg" style="width: 175px; height: 403px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Most detectors work on the basic principle of detecting high-frequency ultrasound and converting it to corresponding audible sounds, which can be listened to with headphones. Additional functions are dependent of the device, but most provide a visual indicator on a bar graph display or a decibel measurement. Some can even capture a time-specified wave signal that can be analyzed with software. Adding sophistication while maintaining simplicity is a challenge that some manufacturers handle better than others, but the net effect is driving the popularity of this technology to mainstream predictive maintenance (PdM) practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic analysis offers benefits for all areas of the manufacturing process. Most machine failures could be discovered early, making them treatable issues instead of replaceable downtime issues. Excessive vibration and temperature increases are indicators of mechanical failure on the horizon, but we also learned that microscopic changes in friction forces, detectable early with ultrasound, provide a bigger window of opportunity for scheduled maintenance. When you hear problems this soon, you are empowered with the ability to limit downtime and overall maintenance cost. Following are some of the most common maintenance applications for airborne ultrasound that can be applied at plants today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Compressed Air Leak Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/a4a9baf2-2d7c-4b4c-8d3a-979afb62b4f9_2c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 317px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Compressed air is one of the most expensive utilities used in manufacturing. Leaks are expensive and often ignored. While they can be heard with the naked ear, they are difficult to pinpoint because of background noise. An ultrasonic detector hears leak turbulence through the ambient noise of the factory floor no matter what. The high-frequency component of a leak is directional, making it fast and easy to locate its source. A compressed air survey with an ultrasonic detector once per quarter will reveal savings potential in the millions and benefit plant managers looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Condition Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One application that has evolved alongside the new generation of detectors is condition-based monitoring (CBM) of rotating and non-rotating equipment. In both instances, production machines produce frictional forces with high-frequency ultrasonic signatures. These forces are often masked by ambient plant noise and low-frequency vibrations. Changes in these signatures serve as early indicators of failure and provide comparative information for vibration data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You want to believe that the majority of your machines are not in an advanced failure condition. Would you rather spend days analyzing gigabytes of data from machines that are not failing or use ultrasound technology to sort the good from the bad so your vibration analysts are focused only on trouble areas? The answer is obvious and reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic instrument equipped with digital decibel-metering measures and logs the intensity of high-frequency frictional forces. Enhanced detectors also capture time signals alongside the decibel measurement. Time signals are useful for slow-speed bearing condition assessment, which is one area where vibration analysis struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/48261632-c29d-4303-b8d2-9abf14caa585_3c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 197px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Condition monitoring with ultrasound provides overall data that is indicative of elevated friction levels from random impacting, rubbing and spalling. These non-sinusoidal events are more interesting to analyze in the time domain, making ultrasonic monitoring useful as a first line of defense instrument. Collecting information is quick and inexpensive. Much more data can be taken, extending condition monitoring to more machines that may have been overlooked by vibration due to time and costs. Ultrasonic monitoring will detect a change earlier in the fault cycle than other technologies. For this reason, ultrasound is generally used to alert changes in condition and for a preliminary diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Acoustic Condition-Based Lubrication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time lubrication breaks down, and the friction forces inherent in any bearing increase. Ultrasonic systems that measure decibel-microvolt levels monitor and predict the relevant need for regreasing of the bearing. When a baseline ultrasonic alarm is compromised, a lubricator is alerted to the problem and can correct it before the bearing is physically damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/3a443189-207f-43dd-8efc-af1da1d1f30e_4c.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 276px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Condition-based lubrication monitoring advises lube techs when grease is needed and warns them when too much grease is added. One problem with adding too much grease is compromised seals. For electric motor bearings, this means grease pushed through the seal and into the windings. One U.S. paper mill decided to stop greasing motor bearings altogether since it was cheaper to replace the bearing instead of cleaning out piles of grease from the motor. This technique has become the norm for establishing lubrication requirements on most production machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Electrical Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The versatility of ultrasonic inspections extends to the electrical maintenance department where routine scans of switchgear, substations and high kilovolt transmission and distribution lines are commonplace. There is mounting concern about safety, specifically the danger of arc flash. Prior to opening high and medium voltage electric panels, inspectors use ultrasound detection to listen to the levels of ultrasound inside the cabinet. The importance of finding problems at an ultrasonic level can&amp;#39;t be overemphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/d157f61c-5c9a-4a1c-924b-1f1d997c210d_5c.jpeg" style="width: 220px; height: 220px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Radio and TV interference are common complaints from local cable companies. Often the source can be traced to a faulty transformer or a failed lightning arrestor. Pinpointing the culprit is quick and simple with an ultrasonic scan. The directional nature of ultrasound focused on a parabola reveals problems from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Steam System Inspections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A steam trap is an automatic valve that opens for condensate and non-condensable gases and closes for steam. It is designed to trap and remove water, air and carbon dioxide, which hinder the efficient transfer of steam, corrode system components and cause damaging water hammer. Ultrasonic surveys of the entire steam system will reveal system leaks, blockages, stuck valves and failed traps. Increasing steam efficiency translates to huge dollar savings and increased product quality. Certain types of traps can benefit from dynamic signal analysis. When monitoring continuous traps, it can be difficult to discern between live steam from a failed trap and flash steam, which is produced when the reduced pressure of the condensate line causes condensate to regenerate back to steam. Viewing the time signal of suspect traps can help distinguish between flash and live steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pump Cavitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cavitation is the result of a pump being asked to do something beyond its specification. Small cavities of air develop behind the vanes. These pockets have a destructive effect on the pump&amp;#39;s internal components. During normal data collection, inspectors use ultrasonic detectors to isolate random cavitation, which can be masked by low-frequency modulations. By using an ultrasonic detector in contact mode, you can isolate the pump vanes and listen for small air pocket explosions. Place the contact probe on the housing of the pump vane and adjust amplification to filter down shaft noise. With some experience, an operator will quickly be able to identify when pump cavitation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reciprocating Compressors and Valves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reciprocating valves give breath to compressors. Worn or dirty valves can&amp;#39;t seat properly. Over time springs weaken, limiting the force necessary to snap open and closed, which causes leakage. Valve condition is monitored with ultrasound inspection and spectral analysis software. The demodulated signal from the detector is fed directly to an analyzer or stored as a wave file. Spectra graphs visualize the compressor valve as it opens and closes, as well as intakes and exhausts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/25c7d2b6-7d87-48e4-bf0a-cf847789bc0d_6c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 192px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Visualizing the recorded sound file of a compressor valve can tell you a lot about the condition of the valves and their components. Valves are opened and closed by a spring mechanism, allowing reciprocating compressors to intake and exhaust. The three distinct events (open, intake or exhaust, and close) all occur at split-second timing that is too fast for the naked ear to process. By viewing the wave file in real time, you can stretch this out to visualize each individual event. Time wave images can also be saved and compared over time to see the evolution of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Heat Exchanger and Condenser Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tube condensers and heat exchangers cool steam, which condenses back to purified water and is returned to a boiler where it is superheated back to steam. Leaks in the tube allow contaminants in, opening the door for corrosion and reduced operating life. Keeping the water pure is the key to efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/67fecff1-ae5a-4aac-a820-526f46242b58_7c.jpeg" style="width: 230px; height: 173px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The general method of inspection involves scanning with the instrument a couple feet from the tube sheet. If a noisy area is found, it is noted. However, if you switch to an extended flexible sensor, you can scan tube to tube. If the sound signal on the digital decibel-microvolt meter or the sound in the headset does not change from tube to tube, a leak is unlikely. This is particularly true of tubes located on the outer edges of the tube sheet, as these tubes are more likely to have noisy steam flowing over their outer diameter surfaces. If a significant signal change occurs, then a leak is suspected. If the leak is within the tube, the difference will be heard at the tube opening. If the noise level is heard on the tube sheet, block the area to eliminate reflected noise, then place a rubber precision tip with an opening of 1/8 inch on the flexible extended sensor and hold it almost on the tube sheet surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Valves and Hydraulic Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time small leaks, blockages and bypassing will manifest inside hydraulic systems. The sources of these faults are detectable with ultrasonic inspection. Hydraulic oil will form small bubbles, which pop as they are forced across seals and wipers. With a magnetic or contact sensor placed against the housing, you can set the sensitivity to the maximum level to reveal the tiny explosions. The signatures from a passing hydraulic valve can be a steady rushing sound or an intermittent gurgle. Comparing similar areas in the system to trace blockages and passing will save hours of visual inspection and teardown time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Where Do We Go From Here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic inspection, detection and data collection have been around for more than 35 years but only recently have gained acceptance in predictive maintenance departments. Branded as &amp;quot;ultrasonic leak detection,&amp;quot; this technology has shed its type-cast role to become a versatile, important and dynamic member of the predictive family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beware of the technology trap. Buying the latest and greatest gadgets, even the useful ones like ultrasound, will only take you so far. For a successful and long-lasting ultrasound inspection program, be prepared to invest in a program implementation specialist to help you establish your goals, plan for the execution of those goals and institute a means to measure the progress of your program as the benefits start rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/8rI-1QcoDuE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Azima DLI, Luminant Enter Agreement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI recently announced a teaming agreement with Luminant to wirelessly monitor mechanical integrity at the 2,300-megawatt Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in Somervell County, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This technology will allow Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant to further enhance our already robust equipment monitoring capabilities,&amp;quot; said Rafael Flores, the plant&amp;#39;s chief nuclear officer. &amp;quot;We are proud to be the first nuclear plant in the country to leverage this new wireless reporting system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comanche Peak is piloting Azima DLI&amp;#39;s Watchman analysis program, which captures critical machinery health data via a wireless network tested in collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute to study the feasibility of a new digital control system compliant with IEEE 802.11 wireless radio emission standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Watchman analysis program automatically captures current machine health data and populates a hosted database. This database is accessible by a web browser to facility maintenance personnel, managers, operators in Luminant&amp;#39;s Power Optimization Center and Azima DLI machine health analysts, all of whom have access to predictive analytics and measures of production risk on a 24/7 basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By collaborating under the teaming agreement, Azima DLI and Luminant expect to share both technical and strategic cost and quality benchmarking standards resulting from several years of work invested in optimizing the Watchman solution. In keeping with nuclear industry practices, the intention is to make available the current state of best practices in machine health remote monitoring with a commitment to continuous improvement based on feedback captured from broad-based industry adoption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In an industry like ours, safety and reliability are of the upmost importance,&amp;quot; said Clint Carter, director of operations services at Luminant&amp;#39;s headquarters in Dallas. &amp;quot;Our commitment to continuous improvement embraces new technology, and we are pleased to pilot this program for both Azima DLI and the nuclear industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Azima DLI&amp;#39;s cultural commitment to responsiveness depends on accurate, timely predictive analytics, all of which are foundational to our long-standing relationship with Luminant,&amp;quot; said Azima DLI CEO Burt Hurlock. &amp;quot;We strive to help the company maintain peak availability at Comanche Peak, while we also pursue the elimination of unplanned maintenance and capital expenditures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Reliability as a Service</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The success of condition-based maintenance programs depends on the ability to drive collaboration among users and experts, and distribute results to decision-makers while having a dependable infrastructure to ensure security, reliability and flexibility. Cloud-based business infrastructures like software as a service (SaaS) can play a significant role, making it easier to share information and support a stable, actionable and sustainable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While cloud computing is sweeping through enterprises for just about every application, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance (PdM) are no different. In fact, the PdM industry potentially stands to gain more from the cloud revolution than most any other industry. To date, PdM systems have been primarily isolated to individual laptop and desktop computers. PdM was completely left behind in the client-server boom of the 1990s. By moving to the cloud, PdM systems are gaining the advantages associated with the cloud, including cost savings, accessibility, collaboration and productivity. Enter reliability as a service (RaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RaaS is a solution that utilizes the broad reaches of cloud-based resources to give more insight into the necessary tasks of the people responsible for plant performance, safety and operations. Whether this includes giving certified analysts access to data to allow for collaboration on fault diagnosis, gaining second opinions from analytics experts, tracking events from fault diagnosis through repair process or relaying risk assessment and business metrics to management, RaaS overcomes collaboration obstacles associated with resource accessibility and driving communications across key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	RaaS Adoption Made Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To encourage greater adoption, RaaS models allow plants to license an application for use as a service on-demand through a subscription model rather than purchasing hardware and software to run stand-alone applications. In the RaaS model, plants need only a computer or a server to download an application and Internet access to run the software to take full advantage of centralized data management, power and security infrastructures coupled with collaboration tools and direct access to certified PdM experts. Despite being a relatively new term to the industry, plant management and reliability and maintenance professionals need to familiarize themselves with RaaS, as it enhances operational efficiencies, improves safety, keeps PdM programs and technology current and drives return on investment (ROI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The catalyst behind plants&amp;rsquo; increasing interest in RaaS is the reduction of capital costs while assuring access to the latest technology. This provides a level of service that delivers reliable information and analysis with universal accessibility to information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. RaaS technology enables the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; business culture and removes the responsibility of implementing and maintaining an information technology (IT) infrastructure, which requires hardware investments beyond traditional data-collection hardware, software licensing, support and training costs. Rather than spending time managing an IT network &amp;ndash; a function plant personnel are not specialized to handle &amp;ndash; RaaS frees maintenance professionals to focus on reaching their reliability and uptime goals without the distraction of IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Collaboration and Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though RaaS has considerable cost benefits, plants that rely on the cloud solely for that reason are not reaping the full benefits of the technology. The first and most important reason plants should evaluate RaaS is because it enables managers and employees to collaborate and share the results of their maintenance and reliability efforts in real time. Instead of sharing information among a small group in the maintenance or engineering department, machine condition health information can be accessed by all stakeholders, including external experts in the enterprise or local plant at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With greater transparency, the condition-monitoring program becomes synchronous with improving operations that are essential to plant availability and uptime goals. RaaS is accessible to personnel from operations, management, maintenance and engineering who are then in a position to make informed decisions that affect plant production and outage planning. This ensures the plant runs smoothly and managers outside the condition-monitoring program always have the most current machine condition information and, as a result, the knowledge to make well-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, ACME Industrial Services is an integrated plant reliability maintenance company that uses RaaS to centralize all of its field engineers who are stationed all over the world. ACME&amp;rsquo;s central facility in India is fully integrated with the field engineers by using a predictive maintenance RaaS solution hosted by Azima DLI in Tukwila, Wash. At the central facility, engineers provide machine condition analysis support, and the results are published within the cloud. Customers can then view detailed condition information for their machines within their local plants rather than relying on spreadsheets delivered by email or other analog channels. In this example, the cloud provides an infrastructure that allows the Indian services company to streamline its workflow and better serve its clients from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Jumping into the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overcoming the fears of even the most risk-averse IT professionals, cloud computing has proven to be a secure and effective technology. With the right education and experienced partner, a plant can easily become more comfortable about the safety, security and reliability of its data in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The keys to alleviating cloud fears are to evaluate the potential RaaS partner&amp;rsquo;s network and security model and see how well it maps to the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. The customer&amp;rsquo;s IT department should be directly involved in these discussions from the start. The IT department will partner with plant personnel to develop a specific set of criteria to evaluate the RaaS offering within the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. Following are some questions that can be helpful to ask when evaluating a cloud service provider&amp;rsquo;s model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do you clearly understand how the cloud computing offering works from the RaaS vendor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor meet the IT security model of your plant?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does your plant have the delegated ability to control access to their system?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will your plant have clear lines of communication with the vendor for sales and technical support needs?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor have a structured change management and patch management process?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Can I obtain a copy of my data if I need to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How accessible and knowledgeable is technical support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Admittedly, RaaS is still at nascent stages of adoption for predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring initiatives, so it&amp;rsquo;s recommended that plants &amp;quot;do their homework&amp;quot; and implement a thorough evaluation of a potential partner. Customer support, uptime and security protocols should be at the forefront of discussions when evaluating vendors, especially if this is the first foray into the cloud. A good RaaS partner is critical, as it will be the key in helping achieve the performance and budget goals that will catch the eye of senior management and keep predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring programs running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Azima DLI, NRG Energy Announce Predictive Maintenance Agreement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI recently announced the details of its predictive maintenance (PdM) agreement with NRG Energy Services, operator of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating Station (ISEGS). Azima DLI&amp;#39;s Watchman analysis program will be implemented to ensure reliability of more than 700 of Ivanpah&amp;#39;s rotating equipment pieces located across 3,500 acres of California&amp;#39;s Mojave Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ivanpah will run a 392-megawatt solar-power facility using mirrors (heliostats) to focus sunlight on solar receivers atop power towers. Solar-generated power from all three plants will produce clean, reliable energy to more than 140,000 California homes. Using electricity generated at Ivanpah means displacing more than 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year and decreasing water use by 95 percent when compared with wet-cooled solar plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Azima DLI Watchman analysis program will be fully integrated as soon as the plant reaches commercial operation. In most scenarios, plants take preventative measures with PdM technologies when experiencing machine failure and downtime, but Ivanpah is currently utilizing Azima DLI technology in acceptance testing and benchmarking of rotating equipment during the project&amp;#39;s commissioning phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ivanpah currently has an internal maintenance team augmented with the Watchman analysis program. This team has been trained on using Trio data collectors and will be utilizing Azima DLI&amp;#39;s eLearning modules to ensure understanding and interpretation of vibration analysis and the actionable information provided. Azima DLI analysts will make quarterly visits to assess more than 700 machines being monitored within the Watchman analysis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our management team understands the value of predictive maintenance technologies and vibration analysis,&amp;quot; said Jim Smith, engineering manager of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating Station. &amp;quot;For this plant to run optimally with as few outages as possible, it is imperative to invest in new technologies from the beginning to help us accomplish this goal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI has guaranteed exceptional responsiveness, flexible solutions and strategies, and a strong commitment to Ivanpah&amp;#39;s employee training. The company&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;fix it before it breaks&amp;quot; mentality will allow Azima DLI to provide Ivanpah with advanced predictive reporting that reflects valuable return-on-investment information, driving increased productivity, reduced downtime and overall equipment health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are enthusiastic about the implementation of Azima DLI&amp;#39;s Watchman analysis program with the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System,&amp;quot; said Azima DLI CEO Burt Hurlock. &amp;quot;They have taken an exceptional approach in executing their PdM program from the beginning. It is essential to take these preventative measures before a failure occurs. In this situation, the Watchman analysis program will be able to properly assess their equipment&amp;#39;s condition to provide timely, accurate recommendations before unexpected downtime occurs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spectronics Unveils New Ultrasonic Diagnostic Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/3/4b487c90-6acf-4ab2-9000-a3c935d39191_MDE-2000 Marksman II for web.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 246px; float: left;" /&gt;Spectronics Corporation recently introduced a new ultrasonic diagnostic tool that converts and amplifies inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; sound. The MDE-2000 Marksman II allows a technician to &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; even the smallest compressed air, natural gas, propane tank, vacuum, steam and other pressurized leaks before they lead to major breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tool uses a two-tiered approach to ensure accurate diagnosis. The receiver converts inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible sound using heterodyne circuitry. The unique Sound Signature Technology then fine-tunes the audible sound into the natural sound emitted by the leak itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 5-LED signal intensity indicator and audible alarm pinpoint the exact source of the problem. An Internal Noise Control (INC) feature safeguards against ambient noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Marksman II comes with an ultrasonic receiver, full-sized headphones, a hollow air probe, a solid contact probe and an ultrasonic emitter that helps locate faulty seals, gaskets and weatherstripping in doors, windows, ductwork and other non-pressurized enclosures. All components are packed in a sturdy carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also offers a MDE-2000NC Marksman II model, which is equipped with heavy-duty, noise-canceling headphones for extremely noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Selecting Reliability-Improvement Tools</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I started in maintenance, I loved looking at the tool catalogs and, of course, imagined how nice it would be to have one of those gigantic tool sets. You know, the tool set with something for every job. Similar to most of the other new guys, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to purchase that kind of tool set and had to settle for a much smaller one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, purchasing tools to increase my toolbox capability was based on need and understanding of the function of the tool. This proved to be a great way to learn how to use my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If in the beginning I was able to purchase the dream set, I probably would not utilize half the tools because I would find myself overwhelmed and sticking to the core tools I understand and only occasionally running across something that I might find a use for. That would have not been a very good investment. By investing in tools as I understand their function, I am able to get the most out of them, and they will get used because I am more aware of them being there by the &amp;ldquo;new toy&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management and improvement tools are the same way. It is easy to dream of having a facility with all of the tools working harmoniously together and being utilized to their fullest extent. The problem is this rarely happens. Most successful programs start with the choice of one or two core tools and then add on as function and need permit. This allows people time to get to understand the tools and develop habits that are effective in application of the tools. As time goes along, those people are better equipped to be able to adapt to more tools in their toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen many horror stories in the making of companies who think that throwing money at problems automatically makes them better and eventually leads to trouble-free bliss. Throwing money or resources at problems often causes more confusion and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of this is a situation where I watched a maintenance manager and a maintenance supervisor replacing buckets on a standard bucket elevator that would normally be a one-man (or possibly two-man) job. The problem was that they were being watched by two Class A mechanics and one Class B mechanic, who were providing the tools for the manager and supervisor to use. Inefficiency has no limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You might ask, &amp;ldquo;What is the right tool for me to start with?&amp;rdquo; I recommend determining what your biggest headache is and then finding the tool to fix it. The tools can range from standard management tools to advanced tools that are designed to deal with a specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing I recommend before undertaking a bunch of the other tools is a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This will provide a solid foundation for some of the other tools to be added later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another recommendation is to implement a reliability program prior to investing in predictive maintenance tools, because it may help you determine which predictive tools you need or want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/ZRYqYScl7a0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Mobius Introduces Machine-balancing Training Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced the release of iLearnBalancing, a computer-based training product that teaches maintenance professionals how to perform in-place dynamic balancing of industrial machines. The training is delivered by DVD or through the Web via the iLearn-online learning portal and is run on a personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The software is designed to provide complete understanding of the different types of unbalance, including static, couple and dynamic unbalance, as well as what is needed to correct them. It also offers ways to ensure that you are not chasing the wrong solution during the balance process, how to tell if a machine is truly out of balance and whether there&amp;rsquo;s another fault condition with similar symptoms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s iLearnInteractive product line, iLearnBalancing features extensive 3-D animations and simulators to make the subject more interesting and understandable. The interactive course is fully narrated, making it easier to learn. Simulators are used so you can experience the interaction between unbalance, rotational speed and phase, and how they affect the balance vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, machine balancing has been as much an art as it has been a skill,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;iLearnBalancing demystifies machine balancing in an easily understandable format so that maintenance technicians learn everything they need to be successful. A well-balanced machine experiences less wear and has a longer life cycle, thus improving your plant&amp;rsquo;s overall availability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kittiwake Launches MHC Bearing Checker</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kittiwake recently announced the launch of its MHC Bearing Checker, a small handheld device that can provide instant indication of machinery condition. The acoustic emission-based instrument is designed as a cost-effective solution to monitoring an unlimited number of machines on a periodic basis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on the detection of high-frequency activity that is naturally generated by deterioration in rotating machinery, the MHC Bearing Checker&amp;rsquo;s Distress parameter removes the need for machine-specific interpretations. If the Distress parameter is greater than 10, the user knows there is a problem and can instigate further checks. A decibel level is also provided, giving an indication of the overall noise of the bearing, which increases with the rotation speed as well as with degradation of the bearing or inadequate lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Each measurement takes approximately 10 seconds and requires no setup, previous history or knowledge of machine design details such as bearing type, number of balls or race diameters. The same Distress interpretation is applied across all machine types, effectively &amp;ldquo;deskilling&amp;rdquo; the technology so maintenance professionals can take a proactive approach to predictive maintenance and make informed decisions quickly and with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides entry-level condition monitoring at a price that makes it a feasible addition to every engineer&amp;rsquo;s back pocket,&amp;rdquo; says Martin Lucas, Kittiwake Group&amp;rsquo;s managing director. &amp;ldquo;This is a simple, cost-effective means of spotting problems in bearings, gearboxes, motors and pumps at an early stage, ultimately saving the company money by avoiding downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The unit is powered by an internal rechargeable battery, offering up to 1,000 measurements between charges. Recharging is accomplished through a micro USB port. The device can be connected to any standard PC USB port for ease of recharging.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides an instant indication of machinery health, but the real value stems from collating historical data and trending,&amp;rdquo; Lucas adds. &amp;ldquo;Devising routes and analyzing results over time enables a better understanding of machinery and creates real intelligence on how the bearings react to changes in operation, how issues develop and how long it will last until complete failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Time Wasters for Reliability Engineers to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the catch phrases. You&amp;rsquo;ve read the success stories. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the return on investment (ROI) calculations and the positive trending that reliability engineers bring. You&amp;rsquo;ve even lobbied upper management. Your argument has been so convincing that you&amp;rsquo;ve secured approval in this year&amp;rsquo;s budget to hire a reliability engineer. The hiring process has begun, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the results: more reliable equipment, fewer failures and increased availability and production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If only it were that easy. Building a reliability program led by competent professionals takes work. It requires setting expectations properly. Most of all, it requires time. How do you accelerate the process to ensure the maximum benefit in the shortest time? Avoiding these top five time wasters could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether your reliability engineer could have been a fighter pilot or whether he needs bifocals, although not being able to read the computer screen while reviewing an asset hierarchy certainly will slow one down. A lack of an overall vision for your facility&amp;rsquo;s reliability program is the No. 1 reason for inefficiency and wasted effort, not just in a reliability program, but with any initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before I became a reliability engineer, I worked as a project engineer improving equipment performance through sound engineering principles. I often was involved in maintenance engineering activities, troubleshooting equipment failures as they occurred in the hopes of getting the plant back up and running as soon as possible. My boss had read an article about the benefits of having a staff reliability engineer, and literally overnight the reliability engineer position was initiated. I was then asked to take the job.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What changed? The title on my business card and the signature line on my e-mails. I continued to perform the same maintenance engineering activities without any real strategic direction, for we had no vision of what we wanted our reliability program to look like.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I worked within my means throughout the next year to learn more about what true reliability engineering was. I learned the difference between a condition-based maintenance strategy, a time-based maintenance strategy and a run-to-failure maintenance strategy, which we had (by neglect) been practicing at our facility for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I learned that a smart combination of the three strategies is ideal, depending on the criticality of the system in question. I educated my boss, and he educated his boss. We learned that reliability best practices are well-established, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We also discovered that there are no shortcuts. For example, if you want accurate failure data, you need to have a computerized maintenance-management system in place. It needs to have an accurate hierarchy that represents the parent/child relationships that represent your plant or facility. The system needs to be populated by operations and maintenance with work requests, failure codes and material/labor dollars so that accurate analysis can be performed. Building an accurate hierarchy takes time and money, and there are companies that have done it before which can help make the process less painful. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of any reliability program, and like a foundation for a house, if done poorly will result in imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Master Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once there&amp;rsquo;s an understanding of reliability best practices, you need a plan that&amp;rsquo;s in line with the reliability program&amp;rsquo;s overall vision. Develop a clear methodology that can be understood at all levels of your organization. It should start with an assessment of current-state reliability practices &amp;mdash; where are you and your facility now in your reliability journey? &amp;mdash; as well as well-defined tasks that can bring your program in line with your vision. As with any good project plan, these tasks should have well-defined dates and persons responsible for completion. Resources such as people, money and time should be defined, and proper approval from site leadership must be obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Communication is vital to ensure proper expectations are set and maintained. For example, if site leadership doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that before maintenance plans can be developed and optimized, site hierarchy needs to be established and a criticality assessment performed, then they&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re working on in all of those cross-functional development meetings, all the while not seeing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prioritization of effort is a challenge we all face, regardless of industry or occupation. In this economic environment, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly asked to do more with less, and there are only so many hours in the day. Where and how we, as reliability engineers, spend our time is of utmost importance. The reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming: developing cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical equipment; conducting root cause analysis investigations to eliminate or mitigate repetitive failures; implementing effective corrective actions; developing and ensuring proper use of facility management of change (MOC) policies and procedures; identifying limiting factors that lead to high energy, utility, maintenance and supply-chain costs. This list could go on and on, but the question remains the same: where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You and your site leadership can determine where the priorities are and address the most critical items first if you have a well-defined vision, a master plan and the proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Measuring Stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you know how well you&amp;rsquo;re performing? Are you and the reliability program getting the results you desire? Are they in line with the overall vision set forth in your reliability program? How can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Waiting for the year-end numbers is like looking at the final score of a football game to see how your team is doing: you might get the information you want but far too late to make the necessary adjustments. A robust reliability program has a strong mix of both leading indicators, which tell you how you are doing day in and day out, and lagging indicators, which tell you how you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I wanted to evaluate the success of a facility&amp;rsquo;s predictive maintenance (PdM) program, I&amp;rsquo;d need to understand the number of critical assets under surveillance, whether inspections are performed on time, the percentage of identified issues that get entered into the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS), as well as the overall program costs, dollar value of saves and annualized cost per unit asset. Once understood, such metrics foster informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no sense in reinventing the wheel. Such indicators should be clear, concise and make sense for where you and your facility are on your reliability journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you know it or not, all of us are on a reliability journey. Just as there&amp;rsquo;s no job that goes unplanned &amp;mdash; even an unplanned job gets planned haphazardly during the execution process &amp;mdash; we and the organizations we support make decisions every day that affect how smoothly the trip goes. Proper alignment and planning can help you avoid the first three time wasters. Proper execution circumvents the fourth time waster, and proper control mitigates the final time waster. Comparison to industry-accepted standards shows us how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and how much farther there is to go.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Identifying Mechanical Faults with Motor Current Signature Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has proven to be a highly valuable predictive maintenance tool. Although it is a relatively young, rarely utilized technology, it is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry today. Mechanical faults related to belts, couplers, alignment and more are easily found through the use of a demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MCSA is simply the process by which motor current readings are recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain. It has been around since 1985 and proven itself well over the years in locating rotor faults and air gap problems in motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor current signature is recorded in a time domain format. The current is represented in a graph form with the amplitude shown on the &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; axis and the time on the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; axis. The result is a typical current sinewave shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to analyze the data, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed. An FFT is a mathematical operation designed to extract the frequency information from the time domain and transform it into the frequency domain. An example of an FFT spectrum is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the FFT spectrum is a great source for identification of rotor bar problems in motors, it proved difficult to analyze most other frequencies. In order to address this problem, the demodulated current spectrum was developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/23/eb7d1922-096a-4a94-b83b-1770a99cbe8a_Figure 1-2.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 182px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Time Domain Format&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. FFT Format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Demodulated Current Spectrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, one of the most exciting advancements in PdM technologies is the demodulated current spectrum. In order to better understand demodulation, the concept of modulation should briefly be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modulation is when lower frequencies are merged on top of a higher frequency. In other words, lower frequencies ride on the higher frequency signal. This makes the carrier frequency the dominant peak in the FFT spectrum, and most of the information is lost in the noise floor of the spectrum. Although they have always been present in the current spectrum, the repetitive load variation frequencies have been difficult to identify and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demodulation is simply the process of taking the carrier frequency out of the spectrum. In this case, the carrier frequency is the fundamental electrical frequency being used. The fundamental frequency in the United States is 60 Hz. In many other countries, it is 50 Hz. After removing the carrier frequency, the frequencies related to repetitive load variations are left behind and shown on the demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequencies such as speed, pole pass, belt pass, vane pass, gears and bearing frequencies can be identified and trended in the demodulated current spectrum. In effect, the motor is acting like a permanently installed transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the technology being relatively new, trending remains the most accurate method of identifying a problem in a machine. The ability to have baseline data when the machine is in good health is ideal, while comparing data to similar machines is also very effective. In the future, as historical and statistical data is compiled, there will be more alarming guidelines established for different types of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Locating Belt Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic current signature of a belt-driven machine is shown in Figure 3. It shows the fundamental 60 Hz frequency being the dominant peak. Note the sideband peaks on each side of 60 Hz that are labeled with their frequencies. This type of signature has the potential of being misconstrued as a potential rotor bar problem. In this example, the sidebands are actually related to belt pass frequency. The mechanical frequency in rotations per minute (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) is calculated using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Mechanical frequency = (the change&amp;nbsp;between line frequency and peak of interest) x 60&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mechanical frequency of interest in this case would then be calculated by multiplying 6.5 Hz by 60. The result would be 390 &lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;, which is the belt pass frequency of this machine. Rotor bar problems show up at pole pass frequency, with the peaks much closer to the fundamental frequency. Pole pass frequency is calculated with the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;PolePass= synchronous speed &amp;ndash; (slip frequency / # of poles)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/18/ba32daa5-0094-4505-bf4d-2c84153b6daf_Figure 3 and 4.jpeg" style="width: 601px; height: 246px;" /&gt;Figure 3. Belted machine current spectrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Demodulated spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the mechanical peaks in Figure 3 are prevalent, this is often not the case. Usually, the mechanical peaks will be lost in the noise floor of this type of spectrum. This is where the demodulated signal becomes so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 shows the demodulated spectrum derived from the current signature in Figure 3. Notice how much cleaner and easier to read this example appears. Without the 60 Hz electrical frequency present, the remaining mechanical frequencies become much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sideband frequencies shown in Figure 3 now show up in Figure 4 at 6.5 Hz along with a 2x and 3x belt pass frequency in the demodulated spectrum. Looking closely at the current spectrum, the 2x and 3x frequencies are present but not as easily identified. Belt pass peaks in this type of spectrum are good early indicators of belt alignment, wear and sheave problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Running Speed Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both drive and driven speeds will also be found in the spectrum if there is a problem. As in vibration, a 1x rotational speed will signify an unbalanced effect on the machine. In Figure 4, the fan speed shows up at just over 25 Hz. In Figure 5, the running speed of an 1,800-&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt; pump motor can be identified at just less than 30 Hz. In both cases, trending the amplitude of these peaks can tell us many things about the condition of the machine. Normally, this peak will be at or near the noise floor of the spectrum. The two most common reasons that the amplitude will climb on direct-drive pump assemblies are due to misalignment or a damaged coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amplitude response on the spectrum is remarkably sensitive. A noticeable amplitude increase will occur with the incorrect key length in the hub. The common flexible-type couplings used will also show up when they fatigue, crack or become twisted. An example of a brittle flexible coupling with stress cracking is shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the follow-up test completed after a new coupler and laser alignment was performed. Notice the amplitude of the rotational speed peak at 30 Hz relative to the amplitude of the low-frequency product flow noise in each spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Demodulation Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another common frequency found in a demodulated current spectrum is the pump vane pass and fan blade pass frequency. This will help to trend and locate problems with the impeller or flow restrictions. In a demodulated current spectrum, it is calculated by using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Vane pass = pole pass frequency x # of vanes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the growth of the technology, knowledge and software advancements, locating bearing faults, gear mesh and other mechanical frequencies with MCSA will also become more common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Incorporating into a PdM program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all that demodulated MCSA can do, there are still many questions as to how it will fit into and benefit a PdM program. Frequently asked questions might include: Why do I care about finding mechanical faults with a demodulated current signal if I can find them with technologies like vibration analysis or infrared thermography? How reliable is the data that is generated and can it take the place of vibration? How often should MCSA be completed on equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With any condition monitoring technology, there are strengths and weaknesses. Each technology applied will give a more complete view of the health of the equipment. For best results, it is recommended to complete MCSA at least quarterly. If a program is testing less frequently than this, the overall results of the motor testing program will be compromised. As with any technology, it is critical to have enough data to accurately trend the history of the machine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for MCSA technology looking for mechanical faults, there are many reasons why this can benefit a PdM program. For example, when it comes to belt and coupler problems, demodulation will give an earlier and often more accurate fault indication than vibration analysis. The amount of energy created by the early stages of this type of fault is relatively low. When belts or couplers begin to wear, it is often not noticed in a vibration spectrum until the fault is nearing catastrophic failure. A demodulated current spectrum has the ability to detect the fault early enough to provide plenty of time to plan and schedule the repairs. However, demodulated MCSA is not intended to take the place of a vibration program. It is best used as a complimentary technology to a good vibration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An added benefit of this technology would be in remote equipment locations or areas where equipment is not accessible during normal operations. On this type of equipment, visual inspections can be difficult, and the ability to perform vibration analysis is limited. Depending on the risk assessment, remote wiring transducers for vibration may be too costly. In this case, MCSA would work well due to the ability of the equipment to be tested from the motor control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of any strong PdM program is having the ability to verify a fault with more than one technology. This not only ensures the validity of the fault but also helps make a more accurate and precise repair recommendation. The importance of verification with a second technology is never more evident than on a critical piece of equipment that requires plant outages for repair. Demodulated MCSA brings an added dimension to this effort and has proven itself to be an invaluable tool for any PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/frEwzOdb6YM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Vibration Troubleshooting Instruments are Inadequate for PdM</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video explains the difference between troubleshooting instrumentation and the types of instruments and software that are used to implement predictive maintenance programs. Often providers of troubleshooting instruments confuse the industrial market as to the differences between their capabilities and true condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Maintaining a Predictive Maintenance Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I finally have a predictive maintenance program off the ground. What do I need to do to keep it running? How do I build &amp;lsquo;trust&amp;rsquo;???&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that you have finished your lists, the work begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have outlined the equipment you want to check, using Excel or some other program where you can create lists that are easily edited. With input from you conversations with the area experts, ask them the criticality of the equipment in their area that is on your list. This information will provide a starting point for the infrared, vibration, ultrasonic, etc., routes that you will develop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have taken those lists you created - in which you have broken out your high-priority items - for a second reading by the area experts. Ask if the lists fit their vision. If they do, ask them where they are having problems, and highlight those on your list.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have realized this equipment becomes the critical components in your list (the place to start).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have found out that the criticality progression goes from, in order of importance, areas with problems first, critical equipment next, all other areas as you can do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you start your routes, here are some pointers for you as you execute the routes and to get better buy-in from your &amp;ldquo;customers&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You will find as you complete your routes that you will cover all of the other areas as part of your route execution with difficulty at first. This becomes easier as time progresses and you become proficient with your equipment and the routes you are executing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remember that your reports are your first and most important line of communication with your customer. Make them the best you can. Always include equipment ID, the area you are in, any information that identifies the equipment to the person receiving the report, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ask for feedback. This will be difficult to get all of the time, but be persistent and always ask for it. Always meet with the customer to see if there is an ongoing problem right now that you might be able to help with. If they see you are willing to help, they will call you more and more often to help. When that happens, you have gotten the &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; that you deserve and require.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With thorough work up front, each of your next steps in the journey will become easier and easier - almost second nature. Your confidence will increase with each good call. Your customers will rely on you more and more for good data and insight into problems they may be having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/HpT7BPcQV1U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>PdM Program Success Starts with Hard Work</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/26/42465461-5b33-4a34-82e2-42e1a25178ac_caution-hard-work_300x200.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;When you have developed a network of people &amp;mdash; either through conference attendance or training classrooms, or through more informal avenues like blogs and predictive maintenance forums &amp;mdash; you have a real sounding board for developing your PdM program. In my experience, though, the only way you are going to develop a true program for any of the disciplines (infrared, vibration, motor testing, ultrasound, etc.) is to put in some hard work yourself. You must determine what should be included and not included in the program and make some decisions on what the criteria will be to determine that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This may or may not be a difficult task, but it is one that must be done. There is no simple way to do this. You will make some mistakes. These will not be earth-shattering ones &amp;mdash; just performing inspections that do not need to be done or are of little value to the operation of the plant. It will be worth it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to have more instead of not having enough. You can always pare items from your program based on your experience using your infrared camera, motor testing equipment, vibration data logger or ultrasonic probe. Each item you cut from your program should be based on your testing and experience. By doing this, you help to develop your technique and experience using the equipment. At first, you will go through a lot of pads of paper outlining what you believe should be included, and you will constantly check your operator&amp;rsquo;s manual for your equipment. In the end, you will know the equipment you will be testing/scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be sure to walk the &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; you have developed. This helps you determine if they are viable. Based on geography, you can modify them so there is a &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; to the walk-around. Always turn on and take your infrared camera or ultrasonic equipment with you. Listen or look at the things you would survey. This will be very enlightening because you will be challenged to adjust the ranges of your equipment so you can get a feel for what you are looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, you need to document your routes. I use Excel extensively for two reasons: 1) it is easy to send the routes for editing by subject matter experts or equipment specialists; and 2) it is very easy to add and delete information in your route outlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have developed the routes that you believe cover all that should be included, take your plan with you and have some discussions with the people on the floor. They can detail the problem areas and will probably offer areas they want included. Also, if delays are tracked, you can see if there are some chronic failures. You may be able to give people some insight with the information you can gather using your equipment. You will be amazed at the understanding gained by these people when you do this for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At first, there will be some reluctance to be involved, but persistence on your part will pay off, especially when you hand off some information that helps them with a nagging problem. Each &amp;ldquo;find&amp;rdquo; will cement your good relationship with these people to the point that when they are troubleshooting a situation, they will call you in for some expert advice or another view on what is going on with their equipment. Your reputation will grow into other areas as well. Soon you will be called by a varied group of people all through word of mouth and a good reputation as someone who is willing to help determine the root of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any work done up front &amp;mdash; developing the routes, updating your route lists, talking to the experts and learning to use your equipment well &amp;mdash; will take time and effort, but it is the best possible energy you can expend on your program. Several years down the road, you will say to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Gee, things seem to be much easier today than when I started, even though I am doing more than before. I wonder why?&amp;rdquo; You will have developed a skill set that will be invaluable from now until you retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/x8iVPD-vFOA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Justifying a Predictive Maintenance Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;How do I quantify my PdM finds? Where do I go to establish my credibility?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grow a thick skin, fast. You have to develop some way of bringing some sense to the finds you have made in your predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that trust has been established and your routes are being executed, you wonder if the work you are doing is worthwhile. Are there any finds to report on to show you are doing a good job? How do you quantify the finds that have been reported and put a dollar sign to the finds to prove the system is working to the benefit of the company or department? How do you show that you are saving money and that the trust you have been afforded is well founded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nobody teaches us how to do this. It is one of the most difficult processes you have to establish in your PdM program, but it&amp;rsquo;s essential to justify your program&amp;rsquo;s existence. My way of quantifying a good find is simply to use a delay avoidance process. I take the cost per hour of rolling time and multiply that times the number of hours saved by not having to shut down. There are a lot of fancy systems out there where this figure multiplied by that then divided by something else gives you a number. Why should it be so complicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/29/f1304e0c-e201-40ef-9682-236e005cb2c8_armadillo_300x2001.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;My first find saved four hours. Instead of being down for seven hours, we were down three hours. Infrared thermography showed a differential between the four pistons in the project block. I selected the bottom right cylinder, and it was correct. Hooray! Repairs were made to the cylinder, it was pressurized and there was no leak. We came ahead and rolled for the duration on the repaired system. The cost avoidance was 4 x $40,000, or an avoidance of $160,000. Through this find, my infrared camera was paid for, my wages were taken care of for the rest of the year, the system worked, and I finally realized that what I was doing was the right thing. This showed that the PdM program could be very successful and a value-added exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are your thoughts, stories and insights on documenting cost savings/avoidances through PdM? How have you justified your program&amp;rsquo;s funding and existence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/ZDmVdunSxzg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Abanaki Releases New Edition of Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CLEVELAND, OH--(Marketwire - April 12, 2011) - Abanaki Corporation, the world leader in oil skimming and coolant maintenance products, announces the new updated edition of its Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook for solving oil removal problems.&amp;nbsp;The new handbook offers expanded information about oil skimming principles, applications, technologies, installation tips, and how to select and size an &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234940&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fskimsel.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In addition, this complete oil skimming guide shows comparative skimmer types as well as turnkey systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An electronic version of Abanaki&amp;#39;s Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook is a handy resource for environmental engineers, plant maintenance personnel, wastewater treatment engineers, manufacturing engineers and related professionals looking for a solution to their oil contamination problems.&amp;nbsp;A complimentary copy of the new Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook may be downloaded from Abanaki&amp;#39;s website at &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234943&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2f157"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;http://www.abanaki.com/157&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil skimming is the most economical, low-maintenance method for removing floating oil, grease, fuel and other hydrocarbons from water. As the oil skimmer belt or tube passes through water, the contaminants are attracted to the media and carried to wiper blades where the oil is removed.&amp;nbsp;Oil skimming uses the differences in specific gravity and surface tension between oil and water to pick up oil, grease and other hydrocarbons. Companies use Abanaki &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234946&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fmodel8.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a wide range of applications from meeting EPA and municipal pollution standards to improving coolant quality in machine tool operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>In the maintenance and reliability business, good enough never is</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	About 15 years ago, I was fortunate to attend a conference where the keynote speaker&amp;#39;s focus was quality. This person was a successful entrepreneur and had built a top-flight company over the past two decades. The company&amp;#39;s success was based on making the best-quality, best-tasting cookie in the U.S. The person&amp;#39;s motto was &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is.&amp;quot; The company was Mrs. Fields Cookies and the speaker was Mrs. Fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the company&amp;#39;s Web site, Debbi Fields was a young mother with no business experience when she opened her first cookie store in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1977. People said she was crazy. No business could survive just by selling cookies. From those humble beginnings, Mrs. Fields became a global celebrity and her company became the premier chain of cookie and baked goods stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than a decade later, I still carry that simple motto, &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot;, with me in my daily work to improve maintenance and reliability practices at Cargill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an M&amp;amp;R improvement process, there are several areas where there is always a desire or undercurrent to shortcut the process. I&amp;#39;d like to show several areas where I&amp;#39;ve experienced such desires and why &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;M&amp;amp;R education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Continuing education in the maintenance and reliability field is one of the best ways for M&amp;amp;R professionals to advance their careers. The application of these learnings to your situation can translate into distinctively better business results. Your company&amp;#39;s leaders will take notice of the higher production rates, better quality and improved operating costs. I&amp;#39;ve witnessed several careers catapulted after applying the knowledge gained from continuing M&amp;amp;R education. However, many professionals fail to dedicate the time and effort. A maintenance and reliability leader needs to have deep knowledge in many areas to successfully lead a team to success. This requires continual learning by reading books and periodicals, attending workshops and conferences, and getting detailed training in the subject areas. It requires you to become a student of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		various Reliability-Centered Maintenance techniques (classical and streamlined)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the 15 to 20 applicable predictive (condition-monitoring) techniques used in your business&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		planning and scheduling techniques&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision maintenance techniques (precision balance, alignment, fits and lubrication)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		various root cause analysis method techniques&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		reliability engineering techniques such as Weibull Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		leadership and change management principles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		business management principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot; mantra requires relentless learning and a passion to always improve and be the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Predictive application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plants and facilities, large or small, use mechanical and electrical equipment to produce a product for customers. Many facilities have little redundancy, so most of the equipment is critical to the facility due to one or more factors: safety, environmental, food safety, quality, production, customer impact and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most critical equipment has failure modes that have consequences that are unacceptable to the business. Therefore, it&amp;#39;s highly beneficial to prevent or detect these failure modes before they occur. This addresses safety, environmental, customer service, cost and other factors. Proactive actions to prevent or detect these failure modes are predictive technologies, preventive maintenance (PM) plans, failure finding tasks and/or redesign efforts. All are outputs of an RCM analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Therefore, most facilities have large amounts of critical equipment that have failure modes in need of detection by these methods. Predictive technologies (condition monitoring techniques) are used to understand the health of a facility&amp;#39;s critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rub has been that many programs fail to employ the right amount of predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies in the plant to identify and resolve the failure modes of critical equipment. Two common deficiencies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1) Use of only a few (two or three) PdM technologies when a selection of 15 to 20 are needed to address the failure modes of the plant&amp;#39;s critical equipment. For instance, a critical rotating piece of equipment powered by an electrical motor may need as many as 10 different PdM technologies to monitor and identify failure modes with undesirable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Application of a very small percentage of the asset base. Many facilities have little redundancy and, therefore, a large percentage (70 to 90 percent) of equipment may be critical in some manner. Therefore, we may need to cover 70 to 90 percent of the equipment with a PdM technology. Which technology to use depends on the failure mode and the consequence of failure to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here, &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot; requires a commitment to cover a large percentage of the asset base with multiple technologies in the proper manner. Doing this correctly may mean earmarking as much as 25 percent of the annual maintenance budget for PdM programs (equipment, tools, labor, training, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Preventive plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Experience shows that many PM systems aren&amp;#39;t designed to address the failure modes of critical plant equipment. Such systems are an outcome of ad hoc attempts to address painful equipment failures of the past. Many PM systems are come-up files of tasks that tell the maintenance team to &amp;quot;inspect this and/or inspect that.&amp;quot; Few are quantitative enough to give craftspeople the proper tolerances, dimensions and measurements to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here, &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot; requires a commitment to possibly redesign PMs. A thorough review of the plan is needed to determine if it addresses a failure mode of critical equipment. If not, throw it out. If so, does it identify the mode in quantitative terms? If not, make it so. Does it give the craftperson the needed knowledge (safety, tools, tolerances, specifications) to do the work in a quality manner? If not, make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Precision maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most crucial area where a &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot; attitude should be employed is in the methods that dictate how plant equipment is built, installed and maintained. Some people call these &amp;quot;precision techniques.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;#39;ve found it can be very challenging to instill a precision attitude in the workforce that builds, installs and maintains plant equipment. I&amp;#39;ve encountered the &amp;quot;Good Enough&amp;quot; attitude in equipment design and building, led normally on the theme of cost control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past 15 years, my experience is that few OEMs truly understand what the requirements are to have a precision-built machine. They equate &amp;quot;precision&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;it costs a lot more.&amp;quot; Many expect a precision-built, precision-balanced, precision-aligned machine to take much longer to build and install. This is seldom the case. It takes attention to great detail and an educated, motivated workforce. Many times in a competitive-bid situation, this extra detail is obtained at no cost. In other words, precision is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When specifying equipment to be built and installed, think &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is.&amp;quot; Insist on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision balance specification of G1.0&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision alignment standards of 0.002 or less, depending on operating speed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision fit and tolerance standards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision torque standards for mechanical and electrical equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		precision lubrication standards that include microscopic particle contamination control procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Precision activities are just as vital during maintenance work. Craftspeople must be educated and motivated to &amp;quot;sweat the details&amp;quot; when repairing and maintaining plant equipment. For most craftspeople, this isn&amp;#39;t a tough sell. They want to do work right but normally are held back by the leadership and a work environment that rewards actions motivated by thoughts of &amp;quot;Good Enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most important actions of M&amp;amp;R leadership is to expect and set the environment to allow the entire organization to practice &amp;quot;Good Enough Never Is&amp;quot; every day. Habitual actions will bring beneficial business results to your operation, much like Mrs. Fields has experienced over the years in her cookie and bakery business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/la16v-YN6cE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Is there life after the death of predictive maintenance?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It is sad how quickly a good predictive maintenance program dies, even though the program has gotten a manager promoted, convinced you and others that there is a lot of value in doing PdM to improve maintenance practices, saved money and gained credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The demise of a good program is usually due to the loss of the program champion. He was promoted because he saved tons of money and improved his maintenance practices &amp;ndash; just overall improved the company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. With a new department manager, the program fundamentally has started from the beginning. The new leader may not have any experience in the PdM world and cannot identify the need for continuing the process; he just sees costs for new equipment, training, equipment calibration, equipment upgrades, etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s world, with such a severe downturn, this is even more prevalent. Cutting costs for everything is the rule &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a shortsighted rule, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that we live by today and will probably live by into the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new department manager may just see the loss of an electrician or millwright, the people side of things. He has seen plenty of good workers disappear to retirement or leave for another job or get pulled out of the department to work in other parts of the plant. So, he sees his PdM people as being involved with non-value-added work when they could best be used somewhere else in the department or to satisfy his manpower-sharing commitment. The new manager also sees his people as being needed to keep the machinery producing, so preventive maintenance work and breakdown work are the priority, especially PM work, which he feels is much more important. That is due to the fact that PM completion is a measurement management has deemed as important, a key performance indicator which impacts monetary gains for the manager. PdM doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Therefore, doing PMs makes sense because it affects his bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing we forget is that the manager is human, too, driven by a different set of rules, most we are not aware of and don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand. We somehow have to come to terms with that reality because it is now our reality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this environment, the infrared thermographer, vibration analyst and motor testing personnel press on because they all have developed a fan base that knows what their technologies can do and have bought them in to their day-to-day processes &amp;ndash; to the point of building PMs for a lot of their equipment using the different PdM technologies. They know that the information generated is extremely important for them to make informed decisions. So these PMs need to be performed. They add value. So, they always get done to the benefit of the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the people who rely on the PdM analyst to give them needed data are the new champions of the PdM process. They continue to rely on this information. The analysts know this as well and they continue to perform their duties, though they are somewhat frustrated because it seems to them as if their efforts are not being rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then you get moved to the Central PdM Group &amp;ndash; heaven. You get to do the work you love all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	May you be successful in your career in your chosen field. I hope you find it very rewarding&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
					A useful spectral tool for detecting broken rotor bars is the swirl effect, which occurs just below&amp;nbsp;the 5th harmonic of line frequency (300 Hz on a 60 Hz line frequency). Swirl peaks are a confirming tool for the pole-pass frequency sidebands around line frequency and occur at:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;swirl&lt;/sub&gt; = [1 - (2/5)ks]5f&lt;sub&gt;Line&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Where:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					f&lt;sub&gt;swirl &lt;/sub&gt;= location of the peaks&amp;nbsp;just below the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; harmonic of line frequency&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					k = harmonic index 1,2,3...&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Global machine condition monitoring equipment market to reach $2.1B by 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Growth in the world machine condition monitoring equipment market has long been driven by capital investments in industries such as chemicals, petrochemicals, pulp &amp;amp; paper, metals, and heavy equipment manufacturing, among others. Condition monitoring has gained importance, over the years, as companies critically focused on asset utilization and productivity. The need for eliminating catastrophic breakdowns and unnecessary maintenance costs in production processes has and will continue to drive the adoption of condition monitoring solutions across several industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the few industries to flourish in adversity is the machine condition monitoring equipment market. A traditionally resilient vector of the industrial equipment market, machine condition monitoring equipment has recorded hardy growth against a backdrop of increased focus on reducing plant operating costs by reducing maintenance costs, optimizing maintenance activities during planned shutdowns and lowering the instances of unscheduled outages. In addition to rising competition, increasing energy costs and plant maintenance expenditures also eat into corporate bottomlines and machine condition assessment programs help optimize maintenance budgets and ease the pressure on operating expenses. While fall in the business confidence index, tighter lending standards, rising borrowing costs and the resulting shortages in credit availability to finance new plant establishments and upgradations, all resulted in sharp declines in sales of general industrial/plant machinery, demand for machine condition monitoring equipment has in contrast increased. A key reason primarily attributed, is the growing importance of predictive maintenance programs, especially so, against a backdrop of tight liquidity, which exerts added pressure on cost efficiency and justification of both fixed and variable expenses. Also, widespread postponement of new purchases of plant equipment has lengthened the replacement cycle thus requiring additional maintenance of aging installed base of machines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of condition monitoring is therefore magnified during tough economic conditions like the present, since intelligent asset management and control practices and strategies will help production plants identify inefficiencies in maintenance practices and streamline maintenance processes. And this acquires critical significance as companies struggle to reconcile the financial drain caused by current plant overcapacity and reduced market demand and still remain optimally positioned to operate on all cylinders when demand picks up post recession. Machine condition monitoring in this regard reduces the instances of unplanned maintenance, which have the potential to increase costs by disrupting production schedules and triggering collateral damage across the company&amp;rsquo;s entire production line, and time to market capabilities. Additionally, machine failure prevention products such as transmitters and vibration sensors are also seen as a measure to combat price increases, and decline in service levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration-based condition monitoring holds the leading place amongst all condition-based maintenance technologies. On- and off-line vibration monitoring is widely used by industries that perform continuous production processes. In addition to vibration monitoring, other techniques used for machine condition monitoring include wear analysis, thermography, performance monitoring, degradation byproducts, and physical testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	US and Europe account for a lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the global &lt;a href="http://www.strategyr.com/Machine_Condition_Monitoring_Equipment_Market_Report.asp"&gt;Machine Condition Monitoring Equipment&lt;/a&gt; market, as stated by the new market research report. The market in Asia-Pacific is displaying strong appetite for growth, thanks to the continuous infrastructure development and business expansion in the region, especially in emerging countries such as China and India. Of late, deregulation and a substantial increase in foreign direct investments in Asian countries has triggered establishment of new businesses across several industries in developing-economic and trade centers in Asia-Pacific. The resulting shifting of production bases from high cost developed countries to the low cost Asian countries also bodes well for the machine condition monitoring market in this region. Future growth will also be driven by increased availability of sophisticated condition monitoring equipment that can capture subtle changes in machine performance.

            <title>How to laser align rotating shafts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video shows how to laser shaft align rotating shafts as quickly as possible with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;True Position Sensing&amp;quot;, available on the Fixturlaser XA and the Fixturlaser GO. Laser shaft alignment with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s dual laser, dual sensor design means the system tracks the shafts&amp;#39; true positions, allowing alignments to often be completed with just one set of measurements and adjustments. The XA and GO laser shaft alignment tools are available in the United States from VibrAlign Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A poem about plant maintenance (you need to read this!)</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Maintenance evangelist&amp;quot; Joel Leonard forwarded this poem to us at Reliable Plant. We thought it important enough to share it with you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jotun maintenance poem&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So Maintenance is a cost, so you say,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Please look at things, another way,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With maintenance correct, your systems run fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;There are great reductions, in your breakdown time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So if you are talking, just maintenance cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Think of those breakdowns, and what you have lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Production, a deadline, maybe a customer too,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Surely you see, that&amp;rsquo;s a bigger cost to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So now let&amp;rsquo;s consider, our CMMS,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;On its own it&amp;rsquo;s something, but still not the best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;However, with planned, and predictive maintenance as well,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sure to reduce, all that production breakdown hell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Then train our operators, on what parts to clean,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Autonomous maintenance, now is that so obscene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Machinery do they know, what operating parameters are set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you ask them, they will say NO, that&amp;rsquo;s a bet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So in conclusion, hopefully you can see,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Maintenance as a cost, a complete fallacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;But to optimise it fully, we need a different attack,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With correct tools in your toolbox, there&amp;rsquo;s no turning back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Train up your operators, these misunderstandings they cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Then between us all, we&amp;rsquo;ll reduce your running time lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Optimise your maintenance, start your journey right now,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Its something to embrace, come on use your, know how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Guohua wind turbines choose SKF for remote monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When the fourth-biggest wind farm operator in China increases its installed capacity by 50 percent within one year, that indicates a company that knows its business. And one of the business aspects that all wind farm operators need to take care of is &amp;ldquo;turbine reliability&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; keeping the turbines turning as much as possible and keeping maintenance activities down to a minimum. Reduced or controlled maintenance is always a valuable contribution to bottom-line profitability, but when you&amp;rsquo;ve got 2,000 megawatts of installed capacity, the target by end 2010 for Guohua Energy Investment Company, based in Beijing, China, then you are talking about huge amounts of money.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	That is why Zhou Weihua, deputy general manager of the production department, took a decision in 2008 to evaluate his maintenance strategy and the technology to be applied within that strategy. A critical decision was to look for the most reliable and experienced way to determine the health of his turbines in the fastest and most effective way.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigating on-line monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With a few different turbine designs and sizes out in the field he needed the best possible way to get reliable and regular information about the general condition of selected turbines of these designs and types. At the same time, he wanted identify any typical negative trends that might occur in the various, but differing, field operating conditions that the turbines would be deployed to. Not being satisfied with his previous assessment process of only using temperature readings of gearbox oil and generator bearing housings, he wanted to investigate on-line monitoring, where vibration signals from critical components are collected 24 hours a day and analyzed to determine exactly if and where problems are developing, and how severe any problems were. This type of monitoring would also provide valuable knowledge that could allow critical maintenance to be planned and avoid unexpected and very costly breakdowns. He knew that this type of condition monitoring is widely used in the United States, Europe, Australia, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visiting Germany for first-hand experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	His first step was to make a deep investigation of what technology was available and the quality and knowledge of the suppliers. These investigations covered all the key suppliers of such technology but contacts with other wind farm operators in China quickly brought him to consider SKF and their turbine monitoring system for further discussions. &amp;ldquo;Of course I knew of SKF,&amp;rdquo; said Zhou. &amp;ldquo;They are the No. 1 bearing specialist in the world with expert knowledge in many industries over many years in many countries, also here in China. And I had heard of the SKF WindCon turbine monitoring system but had never used it before. After direct contact with SKF, I heard that they had recently been successful with remote on-line monitoring, where data from the monitored turbine in the wind farm were transmitted by Internet to their specialists for analysis. In order to get first-hand experience of their remote on-line capability, I visited their Intelligence Centre Wind (ICW), their major wind turbine diagnostic center in Hamburg, Germany.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	At the time of Zhou&amp;rsquo;s visit, the SKF ICW in Hamburg was receiving and processing data from more than 600 turbines from across Europe and also from the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In Hamburg, I saw examples of almost all the capabilities of a SKF WinCon system, because there were so many systems deployed in so many wind farms,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The level of detail that the system could give was clearly demonstrated, and the explanations by the people making the analysis clearly indicated that they knew all about wind turbines and the critical machinery. The Hamburg visit gave me the confidence to set up a field trial on some turbines in Guohua wind farms in 2009&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Field trials at 3 wind farms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The field trial involved 11 SKF WindCon systems to be deployed across 3 wind farms; one in Jiangsu province, one in Shadong province and one in Inner Mongolia. Around the time SKF were installing their systems in the Guohua turbines, SKF had opened a Remote Condition Monitoring Centre in Shanghai. Having SKF experts so close was an added benefit to Zhou and he was anxious to get the systems operating and see what the results would be. The data was collected on a local server at each wind farm and transmitted to an SKF server in Shanghai for analysis. Any immediate emergency situation would be reported at once but an &amp;ldquo;emergency situation&amp;rdquo; was not detected at startup of the monitoring, and a report was issued once per month to the wind farm site managers and Zhou. The reports contained the detailed vibration spectra for the key components being monitored, together with a brief statement that summarized the analysis of the data in terms of the condition of the component. But there was also a &amp;ldquo;report grid&amp;rdquo; that indicated the components being monitored and each one had one of three colors: green, yellow or red to give immediate indication of the condition, with green being OK, yellow being a slight to major deviation from the &amp;ldquo;acceptable levels or trends&amp;rdquo;, and red being something requiring immediate attention.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The first results were good, because Zhou could &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; for the first time what was really happening with his critical machinery. The SKF WindCon systems delivered the vibration spectra, similar to those he saw in Hamburg, and the SKF experts in Shanghai interpreted the data in terms of the condition of the bearings, potential misalignment, gear damage etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	During the six months to January 2010, the SKF WindCons provided good information on the turbines, allowing Zhou to determine if and what maintenance would be required. In that period, one of the installed SKF WindCons identified a severely damaged generator gearbox bearing at the Inner Mongolia wind farm.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success and further deployment of SKF WindCon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF WindCons did their job, said Zhou. &amp;ldquo;They kept me informed and the early identification of the severity of the damaged bearing in Inner Mongolia was enough to allow us to plan for replacement at minimum cost and disturbance to the planned electricity supply from the turbine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the tests, Guohua have installed another 58 SKF WindCons and a further 280 have been ordered for new turbines going into service in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This is the start of a mass application of remote monitoring and Zhou says, &amp;ldquo;We have some knowledge regarding vibration analysis within our own maintenance teams, but I intend to build up more knowledge within the Guohua organization and set up our own remote monitoring center in Beijing for our turbines. A lot of this knowledge and assistance will come from SKF as they provide us with their remote diagnostic monitoring during the coming years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/LAKHPv5XiE4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE notes its favorite monitoring and maintenance apps of 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This past year was a big one for innovation, but few technologies saw as exponential a rise as the mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The creative range could be seen among some of our favorites, such as &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; the iPad magazine created by &lt;em&gt;The Times of London&lt;/em&gt; that takes interactivity to a new level or &lt;em&gt;Flipboard&lt;/em&gt;, the news aggregator app that allows readers to curate a group of publications and easily share the articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, music lovers got to revel in &lt;em&gt;Aweditorium&lt;/em&gt;, a visual, auditory, and informational journey through a world of bands, videos, and songs. &lt;em&gt;Elements&lt;/em&gt; showed that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a Phd. or science geek to creatively interact with the periodic table of elements. And &lt;em&gt;Star Walk&lt;/em&gt; provided an interactive guide to the sky just by pointing your IPhone 4 towards the stars. And these are just a handful of the ones that snared us among the thousands out there already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE has been in the app fast lane, too &amp;mdash; from consumer-friendly apps such as &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/designing-an-even-healthier-app-meet-morsel-2-0/" jquery1293647790089="8"&gt;healthymagination&amp;rsquo;s Morsel&lt;/a&gt;, which helps people chip away at unhealthy habits, to &lt;a href="http://www.gelighting.com/na/home_lighting/design_with_light/iphone_mood_lighting_cam/" jquery1293647790089="9"&gt;GE Lighting&amp;rsquo;s Mood Cam app&lt;/a&gt;, which let&amp;rsquo;s you snap a picture of a room and see how different lighting styles might look to &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cnbc-real-time-for-ipad/id398018310?mt=8" jquery1293647790089="10"&gt;CNBC &lt;em&gt;Real-Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the only free app that offers real-time stock quotes from the NYSE and NASDAQ before, during, and after market hours. (The professional version gives real-time information and analytics on over 100 international markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But three that particularly caught our eye this year are the ones that most people might not at first think of when it comes to apps &amp;mdash; as they&amp;rsquo;re for planes, trains and electric utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;PDS Movement Planner: &lt;/strong&gt;This app for GE rail customers provides real-time rail &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/rails-rebirth-software-hybrid-technologies-spark-a-revolution/" jquery1293647790089="11"&gt;monitoring of all things &amp;ldquo;train&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Currently in a pilot program, it can revolutionize transportation solutions by providing information on traffic, track scheduling, cargo information, geo-location, and train speed. This app makes it possible for rail companies to leverage the &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/railedge-tech-faster-smarter-trains-to-save-millions/" jquery1293647790089="12"&gt;Movement Planner software system&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; which acts like air traffic control for railroads &amp;mdash; on the go so that they know everything going on with each train they have in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Transformers:&lt;/strong&gt; This colorful and vivid app, also in a pilot phase, allows customers, GE sales teams, and field service engineers to remotely monitor and diagnose GE transformers and transformer stations that supply electricity to homes and business around the country. The real-time sensor data helps improves efficiency and problem solving, which benefits both GE and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;MyEngines:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/services-grab-over-13-of-17b-farnborough-deal-tally/" jquery1293647790089="13"&gt;With MyEngines&lt;/a&gt;, GE Aviation customers can get up-to-the-minute information on the location of their jet engine in the maintenance or repair cycle. Imagine being able to take your car to the mechanic and knowing exactly what is happening with it at any moment &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s what GE has made possible for jet engine customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Within our Mobile COE [Center of Excellence], we have a cross-section of technologists from every GE business and division, all focused on moving our mobile efforts forward,&amp;rdquo; says Murali Narassiman, GE&amp;rsquo;s Mobile COE Leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adds James Blomberg, GE&amp;rsquo;s Director of New Media &amp;amp; Emerging Technology: &amp;ldquo;Having a robust and vibrant suite of mobile applications that align with and complement our software ecosystem sets the digital future for GE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the go:&lt;/span&gt; The Movement Planner app is fueled by an advanced software system that analyzes train schedules, traffic control systems and train movements relative to each other and then creates an optimized traffic plan for the trains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Power tools:&lt;/span&gt; The Transformer app for monitoring electrical transformers also comes in an iPad app. As &lt;a href="http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/6435-ge-s-solid-commitment-to-apps" jquery1293647790089="14"&gt;econsultancy.com noted&lt;/a&gt; in a recent story, it&amp;rsquo;s easier for engineers in the field who wear gloves to use the iPad version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="24" sizset="3"&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jet set:&lt;/span&gt; The MyEngines app is tied to GE&amp;rsquo;s software that tracks overhaul progress; allows for urgently needed materials to be researched and ordered; monitors the health of critical engine parameters; and helps engineers make decisions by accessing engine specs and verifying compliance with service bulletins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM software innovations lead to improved operating margins</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The current crop of predictive maintenance (PdM) management software now delivers instantaneous decision-making power for those engineers and plant managers charged with wringing the maximum utility from their facilities while conserving maintenance costs. Capable of instantly analyzing and interpreting vibration data &amp;ndash; along with ferrography, used-lubricant analysis and visual inspections &amp;ndash; today&amp;rsquo;s PdM software not only delivers integrated and prioritized information to plant managers in their offices, but throughout the entire organization via enterprise-wide &amp;ldquo;electronic in-trays,&amp;rdquo; text messages, pager alerts and even HTML pages accessible via a common Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Predicting the repair needs of critical components in lathes, mills, turbines, fans, drills, pumps and any other rotating device allows today&amp;rsquo;s MRO executives to control the destiny of their plant&amp;rsquo;s operations by preventing unexpected shutdowns in the first place. This ability to plan for the future is no longer the domain of Fortune 500 companies, as PdM software&amp;rsquo;s power to deliver answers, not merely data, has even trickled down to small and mid-sized businesses. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building upon the past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that plant engineers relied on run-to-fail (RTF) maintenance schedules &amp;ndash; a method that almost guaranteed unscheduled process line shutdowns. Hardly satisfactory, the maintenance industry welcomed advances in computerization as a means to help prevent expensive machine breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we started out doing machine condition analysis for the U.S. Navy back in 1966, the vibration work was all manual,&amp;rdquo; recalls Dean Lofall, the product development manager for Woburn, Mass.-based Azima DLI, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced suppliers of vibration analysis instruments and PdM programs. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d have a group of engineers that went out on the ship for 10 days to gather all the measurements via analog instrumentation tape recordings. It would then be played back by technicians through a processor to produce a five-foot high stack of graphs. For the next three weeks, a group of engineers would go through all the data, manually categorizing all the machinery and making specific repair recommendations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even the private sector &amp;ldquo;made do&amp;rdquo; with rudimentary results while absorbing huge manpower expenses. Automakers and power companies, for example, would maintain vast banks of vibration experts for the sole purpose of tracking machine life. Perhaps the persistent vision of massive mainframes crunching data from cumbersome Winchester drives possibly accounts for the reluctance of some individuals to believe that today&amp;rsquo;s basic PdM software can run on nothing more than a first-generation Pentium desktop computer. Yet, given the comparative low cost of entry and the gains to be had, maintenance managers of even small manufacturing facilities are now turning to full-featured PdM systems. Such are the advances that have been made over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s systems save money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Overly cautious, prevention-minded systems of the last decade wasted valuable maintenance resources by manually analyzing each piece of new data, whether the machines needed attention or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve observed that 80 percent of the machines in a typical plant will have no serious mechanical faults,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;So why waste time on machine parts that have no need for replacement? State-of-the-art predictiveprograms employ expert systems to weed out machine test-results that look acceptable; thus allowing analysts to focus only on those machines that may have faults. The time saved by not manually reviewing the data from every single machine in a plant is significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example: Some 30 years after its initial work for the Navy, Azima DLI deployed its expert system of PdM software to analyze data for thousands of machines within the U.S. Navy Sealift Command. A subsequent study of 332 such machines confirmed savings of between $47,000 and $62,000 per month, as opposed to manually calculating the data with in-house engineers. The accuracy rate proved to be 8 percent greater with the PdM system, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s PdM systems even predict the future of new equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Spectacular gains in maintenance efficiency and dollar savings have resulted from integrating modern PdM systems into existing facilities. Yet, the use of PdM to predict the useful life of brand newmachines promises to save organizations even more money. In recent years, DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Toledo North assembly plant avoided costly downtime by accurately predicting maintenance failures in newly purchased equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During the launch period of this new plant we requested evaluations via vibration analysis and infrared analysis as one of our buy-off criteria before we signed off on the equipment and took ownership,&amp;rdquo; recalls Terry Kulczak, the maintenance advisor for the Toledo plant. &amp;ldquo;We had already settled on the Azima DLI system for this task because we had good success with it at our Durango plant in Newark, Delaware.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kulczak explains that his team used their PdM system to evaluate more than 600 pieces of new equipment such as regenerative thermal oxidizer motors, water pumps, cooling fans and gearboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the software, we found that there were some machines out there that weren&amp;rsquo;t up to spec,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;Some had bad bearings, alignment problems and improperly sized shims, which led to excessive vibration. These had to be changed out, and it was all done under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At least 106 pieces of equipment needed adjustment or new parts. In his report to management, Kulczak estimated that the maintenance costs to repair these defects &amp;ndash; had they not been detected in advance &amp;ndash; would amount to at least $31,000, with a possible maximum cost of $112,000. Production losses due to failed machinery would have resulted in even greater losses to the plant&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The software analyzed the data and spit out the summary sheet, so you can go back into the data and decipher it a little more closely if you want,&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;From what I understand, older software out there did not have these features. A lot of the contractors questioned our calls, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t use DLI. But we showed them the data and it turns out we were right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains made possible through improved data collectors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The above-mentioned, bottom-line savings earned by investments in maintenance management have occurred through the continuous evolution of each element of the PdM chain. Progress has been achieved at every step, beginning with technological advances in field instrumentation that measures torsional vibration, torque and horsepower, motor current, structural vibration, shaft alignment, and acoustics with every increasing accuracy and fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even more important, an emphasis on portability has placed condition monitoring into the hands, literally, of production floor personnel. As proof, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX pen-tablet handheld computer can host a replica of an entire condition monitoring database &amp;ndash; capabilities previously reserved only for high-end desktops. With analysis tools and automated diagnostics onboard, the user enjoys a tremendous advantage in obtaining immediate answers while in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s versatile and portable data collection systems, we&amp;rsquo;re basically doing EKGs on machines,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Just like when you go to the doctor, an EKG will detect any early problems. Similarly, machines will give off precursors, or early indicators, of future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced processing tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next-greatest boon for plant managers can be attributed to the manner in which this data is now processed with almost real-time speed to deliver intelligent answers regarding machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s vibration analysis software uses an empirical, rule-based logic system that utilizes order-normalized data, spectrum analysis, cepstrum analysis, demodulated data analysis, and other proprietary algorithms to deliver information with an emphasis on providing a straightforward user interface. All data and functions are made available from a single-layer intuitive screen that is quickly organized via a built-in setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If you have a failing machine, then today&amp;rsquo;s software can tell you the severity with a hierarchy rating system, like a five out of 10,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll give you the actual fault or faults. It might be a bad roller bearing in addition to an imbalance. It should also tell you the repair recommendation based on whatever faults it finds. That is why the system is so useful to plant managers; they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to get into all the details. The system automatically does that for them by simply presenting credible information upon which they can base their decisions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real dollars-and-cents gains of utilizing PdM software come from employing these systems to continuously evaluate machine conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With continuous monitoring, an engineer can keep a much closer eye on operations, which brings about the real savings of predictive maintenance,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;For example, there always will be a small percentage of machines, say 4 to 5 percent, where you can see that it is not even going to last six months down the road. So you had better take care of any problems immediately. On the other hand, the most common thing we note is that most machines are running just fine. That&amp;rsquo;s important, because without such predictive information a lot of people would tear down the machine every three years just based on the calendar. But the PdM software would indicate that this machine is still doing fine; no repairs are needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains in integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While maintenance success stories rely on ever-more powerful data collection and process tools, the breakthrough benefits result from the integration of this important maintenance data into one seamless source of concise information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Voyager is an integrated environment that combines vibration analysis, used-lubricant analysis, infrared thermography libraries and even visual inspections (input via portable data collection instruments) to provide a single view of the maintenance status of a plant&amp;rsquo;s machinery. By utilizing one common platform to combine and compare various data sources, a cross-technology scoring can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This yields a prioritized ranking so that facility managers can schedule plant-wide repairs in order of urgency. Reports can be customized to include detailed plots and images to justify comprehensive, program-management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integration of PdM software recently proved itself at Tri-State Generation &amp;amp; Transmission&amp;rsquo;s Escalante generation station. Azima&amp;rsquo;s vibration diagnostic software, ExpertALERT for Voyager (EAV), recently saved Tri-State money by taking machines out of service for necessary repairs based on their condition instead of waiting until they fail, but it was the thorough dissemination of this information that helped make the program a success, according to Joe DeSoto, a results specialist at Tri-State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The DLI Diagnostic Data Collector includes EAV on a tablet-style computer platform that you can take out of the office,&amp;rdquo; says DeSoto. &amp;ldquo;It shows your maintenance people what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the machine in real time and helps explain where the problem is and why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeSoto stresses that providing such information on the production floor is crucial to gaining the confidence of the maintenance staff. Showing them ExpertALERT&amp;rsquo;s diagnostic capabilities in action helped develop trust in the tool throughout the facility and boosted the credibility of the entire PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All hardware products should use a common software and database platform, so they can pass along and process information seamlessly,&amp;rdquo; suggests Lofall. &amp;ldquo;However, establishing common lines of communication with the business system of any given plant is becoming just as important. This type of information-distribution is now expected in the very latest iterations of PdM software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In essence, the latest PdM communication tools excel at &amp;ldquo;bringing the mountain to Mohammed&amp;rdquo; by abstracting data from insular condition monitoring applications, and then placing it at the feet of maintenance decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rsquo;s new networking technologies offer more power and transparency,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;XML, OPC and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DCOM and .NET are breaking down the barriers of integration and distributed computing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, in conjunction with diagnostic software, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s online software permits facility managers to ascertain the status of wired machinery simply by logging onto their network to view real-time vibration data or obtain a complete diagnostic analysis. Under such topology, the online system is simply another node on the plant&amp;rsquo;s LAN. An Active-X component can even be installed on selected computers so that maintenance alert messages automatically pop-up on the screen. Additionally, electronic &amp;ldquo;in-trays&amp;rdquo; can be configured so that only the status of critical, process machines will be delivered to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Connectivity is a big part of making PdM pay for itself, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to have the information unless it gets to the right people,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Certainly, the bulk of managers still get written reports, but now we have the technology to send results over the Internet and through electronic wireless connections like digital cell phones and pagers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking things a step further, Azima DLI offers a unique means of distributing maintenance information by automatically generating machine status summaries in HTML, so that these pages can be accessed via a common Web browser. This allows a traveling engineer to determine machine status, even from outside the company WAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern PdM communication software also allows a significant amount of customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s systems, you could get the condition of a machine right on your digital pager or cell phone with a text message,&amp;rdquo; adds Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Or, you could set it up so that your cell phone would ring every time a machine of your particular interest, reached a critical state of maintenance need. To go another step further, different ring tones can be assigned to different incoming numbers, so an engineer can immediately tell which piece of equipment needs attention. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a matter of preference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These improvements in communication are even becoming available to small organizations that lack integrated business systems. Azima DLI, for instance, operates an online monitoring center on a 24/7 basis, providing worldwide coverage of wired machines. The monitoring program can be set up to deliver maintenance information over a wide range of time frames, from monthly reports all the way to immediate-alert messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	And so, the story of PdM has come a long way from the early days of RTF. Innovative PdM tools now help engineers accurately track the condition of their assets, whether they&amp;rsquo;re using a stand-alone PC system in a small job shop or an enterprise-wide system for a multi-plant industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Kulczak summed up the modern state of affairs when he observed, &amp;ldquo;RTF is not only just a memory, but an impossibility here. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t afford to do that. For us, PdM software proved to be a very useful tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because today&amp;rsquo;s modern PdM systems enable increased uptime, energy savings, and reduced maintenance costs for organizations of all sizes, it has earned recognition as a contributor to profitability. Those plant engineers who have taken the next step from time-based or reactive drills to proactive condition-based planning on both existing and newequipment, are laying the groundwork for even further advances within the field of maintenance management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Optimize wireless condition monitoring with Essential Insight.mesh</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Wireless condition monitoring is a key factor in plant health and safety, however; battery powered monitoring devices require maintenance and put limitations on data collection. Essential Insight.mesh 1.1, the latest version of the Bently Nevada product line&amp;rsquo;s wireless condition monitoring solution, has external power flexibility eliminating the need for batteries and associated maintenance. The external power also allows for the selection of more frequent data collection, meeting a broader range of applications, and it is the world&amp;rsquo;s first electromagnetic vibration energy harvester powering a sensor mesh network. This offering along with flexible mounting options provides easier installation that best meets specific application deployment needs with more flexibility than previous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The addition of Essential Insight.mesh 1.1 is another example of how GE continues to invest in wireless technology and enhance our current solutions,&amp;rdquo; said Sean Coyle, Bently Nevada product line manager. &amp;ldquo;The addition of these features provides our customers with flexible options and alternatives to the traditional battery powered device.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Essential Insight.mesh platform has Zone 0 hazardous area certification allowing deployment anywhere in the plant. In addition, each device supports four channels with up to six measurements per channel including acceleration enveloping, overall value, waveform and spectrum.

            <title>When troubleshooting equipment, first impressions are important</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt1_rc.jpg" /&gt;When troubleshooting a machinery problem, whether for an unusual vibration problem or a component failure such as a bearing or seal, first impressions from the initial machinery inspection are very important. Any troubleshooting exercise should begin with a thorough investigation of machine history - process, design, operation, maintenance, and all available machine details. These first impressions are necessary to make sure the troubleshooting team is fully armed with important data and minimize the chances of a misdiagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people new to the troubleshooting process have a tendency to immediately pick up tools and start working. A better approach is to put the tools down and collect first impressions. While they might not immediately reveal the problem, they may identify a number of issues that are impacting overall reliability. Recommendations for these initial inspections include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt2_rc.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall cleanliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Good housekeeping often reveals that machinery maintenance practices are held to a higher standard. Look beyond dust to the condition of the base and foundation, piping supports, seal leaks, etc., for evidence of maintenance practices or environmental factors that negatively impact reliability. What are the expectations that a field repair can be conducted without introducing contaminants that will shorten the life of the replacement parts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More detailed machine inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with the machine base and look for obvious signs of decay or improper anchoring. Move up to the feet and inspect the shims and hold-down bolts. Poor practices at the base often reveal a lack of quality of other repairs. Move to the shaft and drive (i.e., couplings, belts, etc.) and look for evidence of shaft damage, improper coupling assembly, and incorrect key length. While issues with these areas may not be the cause of the current problem, improvements made with the required repairs will improve machinery reliability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;If running, perform a basic vibration check:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a simple tool such as &lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/OverhungBase_cropped_rc+copy.jpg" /&gt;coin with serrated edges to obtain an impression of relative machinery movement if the machine is still running. While vibration measurements tend to focus on the bearings, with coin in hand, start at the base and work up to the bearing locations to feel for unusual movement. Pay close attention to boundaries and connections such as the base-to-foundation, machine feet-to-base, and all piping and conduit. A simple condition such as a loose base-bolt can have a dramatic impact on the machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Keep detailed notes of the initial impressions:&lt;/strong&gt; They will provide a comprehensive and professional report on improvements that will impact the life and reliability of the machine. While at the machine site, inspect other equipment in the area for similar issues and carefully present this information to the stakeholders. While no one likes to have their flaws revealed, a good presentation of steps that can be followed to positively impact machinery will be well received.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Machinery Health Monitor combines vibration and temperature monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management announces the addition of a unique temperature module for the CSI 6500 Machinery Health Monitor. The new A6630 temperature module complements the vibration monitoring capabilities already available in the CSI 6500 and delivers critical bearing temperature measurements. The A6630 module accepts RTD and thermocouple signals directly, reducing the installation cost and complexity of temperature monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether striving for uptime, machinery protection, or safety, temperature is an important parameter when monitoring critical turbomachinery, compressors and steam turbine generators. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		After overspeed, thrust is the most important protection measurement. When only two thrust position sensors are implemented, monitoring thrust bearing temperature provides an additional level of confidence for identifying early thrust bearing wear and machine malfunctions, and results in fewer missed trips.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In journal bearings, temperature measurements complement the radial vibration monitoring to help confirm bearing rubs and lube oil issues, allowing for scheduling of repairs during normally planned outages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By simplifying the hardware for monitoring bearing temperature, more users are able to take advantage of these critical measurements,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Humes, general manager for Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Machinery Health Management business. &amp;ldquo;The combination of vibration and temperature monitoring enables plant personnel to make informed decisions that can increase the safety and profitability of their facility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In keeping with the API 670 specification, the A6630 has six or fewer channels per module, 4-20mA outputs, and includes relay logic for voting and automatic machine trips.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the CSI 6630 is hot swappable and supports the Easy Integration feature for fast connection to the DeltaV and Ovation process automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Emerson Process Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Emerson Process Management, an Emerson business, is a leader in helping businesses automate their production, processing and distribution in the chemical, oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, power, water and wastewater treatment, mining and metals, food and beverage, life sciences and other industries.

            <title>How a Nucor mill benefits from condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last several years, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s integrated monitoring and diagnostics solution has been applied extensively at Nucor Steel&amp;rsquo;s Hickman Sheet Mill. Automated data collection has been introduced and applied in concert with established traditional manual condition monitoring programs at the mill. Data collected from both methods is interpreted and displayed via a single Web portal and diagnostics are performed remotely by Azima analysts. This article describes the justification, development, application and benefits of such an integrated solution. Specific case studies will be presented along with discussions of deployment issues and barriers that have been overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition Monitoring Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition monitoring, commonly referred to as predictive maintenance, is a proven approach to improving reliability and productivity in industry. Its underlying philosophy is that technology can be used to measure and evaluate the condition of plant assets and equipment, thus enabling intelligent decisions to be made about maintenance activity. In this manner, maintenance is applied to the assets that need attention, while those whose performance and condition are determined to be normal are left alone to perform productive roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The initial application of condition monitoring was in the utility and petrochemical industries in the 1970s. During this period, tremendous plant expansions and constructions were taking place, and plant scale increased dramatically. Instead of being dependent on many small machines, plant train size and capacity were such that a typical refinery or large generating plant became absolutely dependent on a very few, very large and very expensive capital machines. The loss of one of these capital assets (primarily rotating machinery) to mechanical failure could (and did) result in major income losses and, in the case of some the larger petrochemical plants, actual disruptions in markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This reality resulted in the development of fault protection systems (warning/trip systems based on vibration analysis) for protecting rotating capital machinery from catastrophic failure. These fault protection systems proved very successful in preventing crashes and limiting the damage from machine failure. These systems were soon institutionalized and standards (API, etc.) were developed and accepted throughout the appropriate industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the success of fault protection systems, many plant operators began to suspect that similar approaches could be applied to the myriad of smaller machines in the plant. Even though the failure of one of these smaller machines could not itself shut down a plant, the aggregate cost of repairs on these machines made the application of condition monitoring an attractive prospect in a typical refinery or chemical plant. However, the high per-machine cost of applying a fault protection system prohibited this from becoming a reality. Instead, technology responded with the development of portable measurement instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning with simple meters, manual log sheets and trending, machine surveillance programs were born. Beginning in the late 1980s, the explosion of PC/computer technology drove the development of computerized manual data collection systems which rapidly gained success in the plant maintenance market. In very short order, the use of &amp;ldquo;data collector&amp;rdquo; systems &amp;ndash; programmable black boxes with well-defined measurement capabilities &amp;ndash; spread to many industries, including the steel industry. A &amp;ldquo;route&amp;rdquo; defining the machines to be measured and the specific measurements to be taken was created in PC-based software and downloaded to the data collector. Personnel would go out into the plant to collect data with the device and then upload the data. This data would then be analyzed and a report was issued recommending appropriate maintenance actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the tremendous advances in data processing technology, these so-called &amp;ldquo;walk-around systems&amp;rdquo; have progressed to the point where the limit is no longer measurement technology. Megabytes of machine condition data can be gathered in a day, with relatively low skill requirements. This approach represents the status quo to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Contentional&amp;rsquo; Walk-around Data Collection &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Current data collector systems are very powerful and represent near-miraculous improvements over the initial 1980s systems. Modern data collectors are intended primarily to collect rotating machinery vibration data (although other scalar and non-dynamic data, including manual observations and comments can typically be entered). The accompanying software enables the presentation of the collected data for analysis. This software typically supports the incorporation of other external data, such as infrared thermography and lubricant analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical EAF/mini-mill environment, the actual execution and responsibility for such a walk-around vibration program resides either in-house or with outside contract resources. A typical AF/mini-mill with an associated cold mill may have 500 to 600 individual machines under monitoring/surveillance via data collector/walk-around methods, with somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 individual measurements being taken each month. This represents, under typical conditions, about one to two man-weeks of measurement effort alone. Data analysis typically consumes another man-week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s manual data collector systems have reached a near-zenith in efficiency. Early on (late 1980s), processing technology in microprocessors and memory limited their performance and, depending on the measurements to be taken, the technician analyst was often waiting for the data collector to do a given task. As such, his efficiency was limited. Processing technology today has advanced to the point where the required sample times and the fundamental mathematics of data digitization are the time limit, rather than the performance of hardware and software. It is not reasonable to expect any significant gains in terms of data collection time due to measurement technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a manual data collection program, achieving a load factor (time spent actually taking measurements as opposed to traveling from point to point, uploading and downloading data, etc.) of 60 to 70 percent is a significant achievement. It is not unusual for the data collection portion of a condition monitoring to consume 70 percent or more of recurring operating/labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is, of course, only part of the process of executing a successful condition monitoring program. Data analysis, screening processes and reporting are essential to achieving cost reductions and improvements in uptime. In most cases, the availability and skill of personnel with the proper experience and training are the governing factors in the success of a condition monitoring program. Collecting data is not hard; making the appropriate use of the data is much more difficult to achieve consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite very capable measurement technology, condition monitoring success in a given plant is still dependent on the ability to gather and correctly interpret data from the plant machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manual data collection processes, even in the presence of efficient data collection and skilled analysis, are still snapshot in nature and may not reflect the actual operating conditions that plant equipment experience. This is because there are more day-to-day variations in data than is revealed by a monthly collection route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historically, the steel industry has been willing to adopt condition monitoring as a means of improving mill productivity, and many successful programs are extant in mills. Whether contracted out or executed in-house, the same issues governing successful implementation of a condition monitoring program exist. The most difficult issue is retention of the appropriate skills and experience in the condition monitoring role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to be successful an individual must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be very conversant with rotating machinery and machine components &amp;ndash; the individual has to understand couplings, bearings and gears, machine dynamics (at least at some basic level), and the factors that affect machine wear and tear.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be at least conversant with (or be able and willing to be trained in) more esoteric concepts like spectrum analysis, frequency analysis, phase, modulation, etc., and have sufficient understanding of some basic concepts that normally are not part of the vocabulary of an individual with the requisite mechanical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be competent with computer technology, at least to the level of an advanced application user &amp;ndash; all of the current condition monitoring technologies involve computer usage to a very large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be a skilled communicator. Clearly explaining the reasoning behind a given recommendation is a key and often overlooked requirement for a successful condition monitoring program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be willing (or have personnel that are willing) to routinely do hot, dirty, repetitive data collection work, that typically involves difficult-to-access or hazardous areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not hard to understand why maintaining the appropriate people resources, whether in-house or contracted out, is difficult to achieve over the long haul. In the developing years of condition monitoring technology (late 1970s to early 1990s), most plants, regardless of size, had one or two (sometimes many more) resources devoted to condition monitoring programs. This supply led to an effective &amp;ldquo;farm club&amp;rdquo; system that supplied experienced personnel to both the in-the-plant programs and outside contract/consultant sources. Changes in plant manning, personnel and position rotations, and retirements have resulted in a situation where the availability of such personnel is limited and shrinking, and the cost of those workers is rising. The decline in the availability of human resources with the appropriate experience and skill sets has led to the exploration of ways to bring the data to the analyst. In this manner, a person with the requisite skills can cover far more industrial real estate than would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Remove Monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the late 1970s, adoption of automation for plant and process control and communication has risen substantially both in complexity and market acceptance. Computers on every desk and in every control room are now the norm. Mills and plants typically have very sophisticated and extensive IT networks for both administrative and process control/automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First approaches in many diverse industries involved transmission of machine-condition-related data to existing Man-Machine Interface (MMI)/Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems. Particularly, existing machinery protection (warning and trip) systems were tied into control room HMI/MMI interfaces so that operators could view vibration, temperature and other machine condition parameters. Typically, these were magnitude-only scalar values, which &amp;ndash; while valuable in terms of information and indication of possible machine problems &amp;ndash; were lacking in terms of trending, analysis and data interpretation capabilities. Plant personnel were thus receiving information that a given machine was vibrating more, or a bearing temperature was going up, etc. This left open the question of why these changes were occurring, and how the plant should react to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advances in technology, the Internet and the need to more efficiently monitor machinery with limited personnel drove the development of expanded remote monitoring systems. Rather than delivering machine data in-house only (to the control room, etc.), technology and the Internet enable information to be accessed from anywhere, anytime. This new method uses field-mounted sensing devices and instruments, some sort of aggregating devices, advanced software, and access to plant and external networks for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits of such a system are apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More frequent monitoring of machinery without a need for data collection/analysis personnel to be present, as well as the ability to observe dynamic changes in machine condition due to load, speed and operating conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to move data off-site for remote consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to have multiple resources in multiple locations looking at data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to monitor parameters other than what would normally be monitored in a traditional manual program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to assess machine performance in terms of efficiency, throughput, etc., and relate that data to machine condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Condition Monitoring at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman has had a condition monitoring program in place for more than 10 years. The program was based around traditional manual survey methodology and techniques, and was provided by outside contract resources. Data was collected on equipment across the mill on a monthly basis, with frequent callouts for troubleshooting and analysis of specific problems. After data collection, analysis was performed and written reports with recommendations were disseminated to appropriate mill personnel. All systems in the mill (environmental, hot mill, casters and melt shop) were included. In 1998, Nucor Hickman added a cold mill facility, with pickling line, galvanizing line, RT mill and annealing capability. The traditional monitoring program was expanded (nearly doubled) to include this portion of the mill. After the integration of the cold mill into the program, 590 machines were under monthly surveillance. A typical survey required two to three man-weeks to complete by manual methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As early forms of remote data collection and analysis methods became available, opportunities rose where remote monitoring might be practical and beneficial. In the first case, caster mold water cooling pumps, which had traditionally been a maintenance problem, became a potential application due to changes in operating conditions. The mold water pump installation at Nucor Hickman at that point consisted of three 700-horsepower opposed suction centrifugal pumps, direct coupled to induction motor drivers. In typical operations, two pumps were in service and one maintained as in inline spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operational requirements dictated a need for increased mold water flow, and all three pumps were placed in service. This had a negative impact in terms of pump vibration levels and reduced confidence in pump reliability. There was no remaining spare capacity (the standby pump was now in continuous service), making the impact of a pump failure significant. Nucor Hickman decided to apply some of the early remote, Internet-based monitoring technologies to the pumps. Expected benefits were closer-to-real-time problem detection and better understanding of the pumps&amp;rsquo; vibration behavior. In addition, a current sensor was added to the systems on each motor, which would allow monitoring of system load in parallel with pump and motor vibration on each of the pumps. The system would report bearing temperatures, vibration magnitudes, discharge pressures, current magnitudes and frequency content/time domain vibration data from each pump. This data was available to contractor analysis personnel, who were responsible for monitoring the pumps&amp;rsquo; behavior, and also to plant personnel. In addition, the data was available over the Web, making it accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection. Multiple users could access the system at the same time from multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Internet-based monitoring system was installed with data being collected much more frequently and under different operational conditions. Within days of commissioning the online remote system, it was obvious that the vibration behavior of the pumps varied much more widely than had been indicated by the once-per-month data. This is because monthly data &amp;ndash; even several years worth of it &amp;ndash; was simply insufficient to notice it. The frequent collection enabled by the automated system clearly showed 3:1 variations over different operational modes. In addition, load current data (which was not available from the traditional once/month data) indicated that the pumps were typically not loaded nearly to capacity, and were operating well off curve. As a result, an engineering study of the pump systems and operation was commissioned. The study concluded that sizing errors, control strategies and piping configurations were incorrect for the desired operating conditions. The pumps were resized and other changes were put in place to provide the desired increased flow. This provided spare capacity without the need to run all three pumps, and contributed materially to improved cooling and mold life. It is highly unlikely that these issues would have come to light without the data provided by the remote monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further applications of remote monitoring technology were installed on baghouse ID fans and utility air compressors in the hot mill. The hot mill air compressors are three-stage centrifugal machines, directly driven by two-pole induction motors. The compressors and motors were on monthly surveillance and were subject to frequent bearing failures in the drive motors. Once-per-month data was catching bearing failures often, but trends were erratic and no clear root cause was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When remote monitoring technology was applied, it became clear that &amp;ndash; as with the mold water pumps &amp;ndash; the vibration levels were varying much more than had been apparent from the monthly manual data. It was also clear that the variations had a pattern that closely tracked ambient temperatures. Since bearing temperatures also were being monitored, it was clear that when ambient temperature went up, vibration levels increased dramatically. Analysis of the frequency content provided by the remote monitoring system clearly indicated that the cause of the increase in vibration was imbalance in the motor rotors. Further review of bearing wear patterns indicated an extreme thrust load was being placed on the motor&amp;rsquo;s radial Conrad-type ball bearings. From this, it became apparent that at high temperatures the motor rotor was expanding axially and there was insufficient clearance in the motor bearing fits to allow for this expansion, causing rotor bow (hence the imbalance) and axial overload of the motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of this discovery, the compressor drive motors were replaced with an alternate design. Vibration levels, as reported by the remote monitoring system, remained low and reliability dramatically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the cold mill at Hickman, the RT mill stand drives were equipped with four 5,000 HP synchronous motors. The motors were journal bearing machines and were not reliable. Thrusting and resultant bearing failures, along with pole piece electrical failures, led to the 2004 installation of a warning and trip system based on proximity probes on the motors and accelerometers on the mill gearboxes. This system not only supplied warning and trip capability, but also provided near real-time vibration data, including shaft orbits, to analysis personnel outside the mill. Remote analysis personnel could be hundreds of miles away, viewing near-real-time data, and consulting directly with pulpit operators on problems with the mill stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these and other successes, it was clear that remote machinery monitoring offered improvements and capabilities not provided by conventional means. However, this early system did have limitations. It relied on serial RS-485 communications with a scanner/site server. As the system expanded, sampling rates slowed down and the most recent data was not available in a timely fashion. It also used proprietary sensors, which limited configurability and flexibility of application. The system on the RT mill, while powerful, was expensive and was limited to one user at a time due to its use of VPN technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in late 2004 and early 2005, Nucor Hickman undertook deployment of wireless technology in the mill. The justification was shipping and inventory applications, cranes and systems in the hot mill, and to meet other operational requirements. At the same time, improved remote monitoring technology was coming on the market using the same wireless protocols. This new remote monitoring technology, developed by Azima DLI, used commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, standard networking protocols, and was much more flexible in terms of software and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The convergence of wireless technology, its application in the mill, and the availability of improved technology all drove expansion of Nucor Hickman&amp;rsquo;s remote equipment monitoring. It is interesting to note that the wireless implementation and deployment was justified by other applications within the mill. The impact of the machinery monitoring data on the network has been minimal, and even with the extensive deployment at Nucor Hickman, represents a tiny fraction of network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nucor Hickman: Largest Remote Monitoring Deployment in the U.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As of the publication of this article, the Nucor Hickman Sheet Mill was the site of the largest dynamic signal remote monitoring deployment in the United States. Azima remote monitoring technology is used on all mill cooling towers, all baghouse ID fans, all baghouse reverse air fans, caster mold water pumps, caster spray water pumps, all descale pumps, roof feed flux system aspiration fans, and mill air compressors. Remote monitoring system installation is underway on mill emergency generator sets, and is planned for the near future shape tension rolls in the cold mill. Approximately 280 sensors are remotely monitored. Mill personnel have full access to data, alert histories, alarms and warnings, reports and report/machine histories. Alerts are transmitted by e-mail and/or cell phone SMS text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system currently applied at Nucor Hickman communicates through the plant network either via 802.11b wireless technology or via standard Ethernet (unlike earlier systems, which required serial RS-485 communication). A single small site server (standard PC) is located at the plant to act as a data gateway and buffering device. If connectivity out of the mill is lost, the site server acts as a data storage device buffering data until connectivity is restored. One of the key features is that the monitoring application requires no software on the target client PC &amp;ndash; all that is required is Internet access and a login for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of sensors mounted on the target machine and a sensor hub that digitizes and aggregates data from the sensors. Collected data is transmitted securely to the plant network via either 802.11b wireless or Ethernet. (Note that, although not currently employed at Nucor Hickman, the system also supports data transmission via a cellular interface, independent of the plant network.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Data is sent via the plant network to the local site server and then out over the Internet to Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s remote servers. Plant personnel, analysts or other authorized parties can then access the system via a secure Web portal. Access and privileges are controlled by double password, and depending on privileges, a user can have rights to view data, edit system settings, analyze data and/or issue reports. All data, alerts and alert histories, and reports generated by analysts are maintained on the Web portal. Histories of reports generated can be sorted and searched by plant area, date, machine, fault type and other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the number of remotely monitored machines continues to expand at Nucor Hickman, many less critical machines remain under manual surveillance by operators on rounds once a month. These machines include those in the balance of plant (hydraulic pumps, roll stand cooling pumps, furnace cooling pumps, and so forth). This monthly data is fed into the Azima DLI system and displayed via the same secure Web interface as the remotely collected data. This means that a mill-wide view of equipment health &amp;ndash; from all monitored machines, regardless of collection method &amp;ndash; is visible via a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima analysts are responsible for monitoring and analyzing all posted to the Web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Involved in Getting Remote Monitoring Started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the most attractive features of the remote monitoring system at Hickman is that it is comprised primarily of low-cost, commercially available components (for example, COTS sensors) combined with advanced software and specialized sensor hubs. Careful planning and forethought is needed to ensure a successful remote monitoring deployment. Some of the lessons learned include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Careful thought should be given as to which machines are to be monitored and in what manner. In the case of Hickman, although the condition monitoring contractor had overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the system, and for disseminating the analysis and results there from, each individual mill area had to decide what was to be monitored and how. Reporting relationships, access and other issues were all discussed and defined well ahead of the installation of monitoring equipment. There was a clear list of which equipment would benefit from automated remote monitoring and which could be sufficiently monitored by conventional methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of points per machine to be monitored is an important consideration. Simply mimicking what would have been done in a manual monitoring program (multiple points and measurements per bearing) is usually unnecessary and adds cost while delivering small incremental value.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If wireless transmission is to be employed, determine the best protocol for the site: 802.11b/g, ZigBee, or 900 megahertz. In the case of Hickman, 802.11b was the preferred choice and that has been universally true in other applications as well. It offers the widest selection of available devices, and can cover a wide area with just a few access points. The 802.11b protocol has proven to be very reliable and is immune to RF interference, even in the melt shop area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve IT early. Agreement needs to be reached on security, protocols, etc. well before the installation of a remote monitoring system. What are the mill&amp;rsquo;s security expectations and policies? Within the plant, is traditional Local Area Network (LAN) acceptable, or is a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) necessary? IT support during deployment is crucial to successful and efficient startup. Connectivity must be verified, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Remote Monitoring Benefits Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The initial deployment of the current generation of remote machinery monitoring technology commenced in July 2005. The installation and commissioning of Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring system is continuing to expand. The hybrid approach of monitoring critical machines in parallel with traditional manual walk-around monitoring of balance-of-plant equipment, all reported via a common Web-based portal, has provided solid value to Nucor Hickman personnel. Several case studies demonstrating this value are briefly detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 1: Failure Caught Without Site Visit or Increased Costs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the spring of 2006, a 1,500 HP baghouse fan induction motor failed due to a sudden stator short failure. All of the baghouse fans were equipped with remote monitoring hubs and were under surveillance. The motor was replaced with a rebuilt spare. Immediately on restart of the fan, much higher vibration levels were noted by the remote monitoring analyst (who was not on site). Mill environmental department personnel, who were responsible for the baghouse and its equipment, were notified of the increased vibration. Further examination of the data identified the problem as an outer race defect on the inboard (drive end) bearing of the motor. Mill personnel requested an evaluation as to the likelihood of the motor continuing in service until the next maintenance outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analysis of the data and the rate of change indicated that it was likely that the unit would indeed continue to run. In an attempt to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, attempts at relubrication of the motor bearing were undertaken. Unfortunately, the relubrication actually increased the vibration, and the rate of deterioration increased dramatically. Mill personnel were advised of the change, and monitoring surveillance increased (frequency of data collection can be increased remotely via the Azima system&amp;rsquo;s interface). The unit continued to deteriorate and, by the weekend, had reached a stage wherein continued operation was questionable. A recommendation was made to remove the unit from service at the first opportunity. After mutual viewing of the data and trends by plant personnel in conference with the remote analyst, plant personnel decided to remove the unit from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A spare fan was placed in service while the motor replacement was undertaken. The spare fan also was equipped with sensors that reported to the Azima system. Prior to beginning disassembly of the failed fan, the spare was restarted and vibration and performance data was reviewed by the remote analyst, who confirmed that the spare fan was running well and could be expected to give reliable service while the failed fan was repaired. Only after the confirmation of the health of the spare was the failed fan removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that at no time during this episode was the equipment analyst on site at the mill. Problem detection, confirmation of the problem and diagnostics (including the condition assessment of the spare fan) were all conducted remotely with no site visits and no costs incurred. In the case of the confirmation of the condition of the spare fan, the contractor analyst was in an airport hundreds of miles away and was still able to serve the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unlikely that this level of detection, service and continued operation could have been achieved with conventional once/month survey method. Using conventional methods, it is likely that several site visits would have been required with extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/394552f5-f4a2-4740-b552-559d87eacac7_Nucor Hickman_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Trend Graph Showing Vibration Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 2: Air Compressor Runs the Last Mile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A centrifugal induction motor-driven air compressor had suffered from poor reliability for some time. Beginning in the spring of 2006, it was equipped with remote monitoring technology. Immediately upon installation of the system, dramatic variations in motor vibration level with compressor load were noted. Remotely acquired and analyzed vibration data indicated that bearing fits were in poor condition, and that the spacer gear coupling associated with this compressor was partially locked up. A recommendation was made to not yet remove the unit from service, but rather to continue to run and monitor it while preparations for a repair were made. Data also was provided to the motor repair vendor. The motor repair vendor concurred that the vibration data indicated a problem but that it was likely confined to the coupling. The recommendation was made by the motor repair vendor to disconnect the coupling, run the motor solo, and take manual measurements to confirm the coupling problem. The coupling was disconnected, the motor was run solo and manual vibration measurements were undertaken. The motor was actually worse in the uncoupled condition, and before the vibration measurements could be completed, the motor failed catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the motor repair was completed and the unit returned to service, the remote monitoring system was recommissioned and was able to confirm that the motor and compressor were in good condition and suitable for continued service. This condition persisted for several months, with the unit running well and remote monitoring continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, following a mill outage, the compressor motor vibration exhibited a small but unmistakable increase in overall vibration on the motor. The melt shop personnel were notified and the recommendation was made to continue to run the compressor. Monitoring frequency was increased and alert thresholds adjusted to compensate for the changes. No site visits were required and the increased monitoring and adjustments were accomplished remotely via the system&amp;rsquo;s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few weeks later, the adjusted alert levels were exceeded, and automated alerts were issued. No other changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few more weeks, the steady trend upward in motor vibration continued. Plant personnel were continuously advised as to the deteriorating condition of the unit, as was the motor repair vendor. Finally, the deterioration reached a level where the remote analyst recommended removing the unit from service at the convenient opportunity. The motor repair vendor sent personnel to the site to take manual vibration measurements on the motor. The manual measurements confirmed the problem and the unit was removed from service and sent out for repair. A coupling issue and deterioration of the inboard motor bearing was confirmed. Again, no site visits by analysis personnel were required and the plant was able to &amp;ldquo;run the unit the last mile&amp;rdquo; without incurring catastrophic failure or mill outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/46d29376-fd1c-4a99-999f-5fa8c7feb97e_Nucor Hickman_3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 3: Remote Monitoring Enables System-Wide Process Optimization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A remote monitoring system can, as in the cases above, greatly expand on the capabilities of conventional rotating machinery vibration analysis. What many do not realize is that remote monitoring technology can also contribute in ways that are not possible with conventional manual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The baghouse fans at NUCOR Hickman are vital to the plant. Maintenance of plant productivity, while still staying within permitted emission limits, is essential to plant profitability. Operating costs (in terms of power consumption) for several thousand horsepower of fan drives is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring system, as applied to the baghouse fans at Hickman, incorporates vibration measurements along with load current measurements. Sampling rates are very rapid, and the baghouse fans at Hickman have an essentially unity power factor. The fan motors are not individually metered at the MCCs. With the rapid sampling of the remote monitoring system, however, it became possible to get a reasonably accurate measure of fan load and operating cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after commissioning the baghouse fan remote monitoring system, is was seen that variations in fan load and fan vibration were, not surprisingly, directly related to tap-to-tap cycles of the EAFs. All of the fans take suction from a common plenum, which is in turn fed by the furnace and canopy ducts. Data collected by the remote monitoring system allowed observation of the dynamics of fan load as the melt shop underwent normal operation cycles. The ability to average and integrate the load data unexpectedly revealed that significant variation in fan HP load existed not only during furnace cycles but from one fan to another. The data indicated a several-thousand-dollars-per-month variation in the operating cost of the fans. After data review, it became apparent that there was significant temperature (and thus density and mass flow) variation from one fan to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The variation in load was confirmed by temperature measurements and infrared thermographic observation of the change in duct temperatures over time. Poor distribution in the plenum has been partially corrected by installing turning vanes in the plenum and adjusting damper control strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material improvements in fan efficiency have been realized as a result of these actions. The remote monitoring system allowed quantification of these issues and the ability to directly measure the effects of corrective action. This would not have been possible with conventional machinery monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman is embracing new remote monitoring technologies and integrating them with its existing manual data collection process. By determining the most effective monitoring method for each machine &amp;ndash; based on level of criticality, history of problems, and so forth &amp;ndash; Nucor has established a comprehensive monitoring program that delivers increased uptime, reduced safety risks, and lower maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By choosing the Azima DLI monitoring and diagnostics system, Nucor has installed a flexible system that supports the integration of data collected both by automated system and manual rounds. All data is presented via a single, secure Web interface. This enables mill-wide alerts to potential problems and delivers critical data to remotely located Azima analysts for review, analysis and advice. In addition to providing more comprehensive monitoring, Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring solution has reduced the demand on existing resources at Nucor Hickman and frees them up to focus on maintenance rather than data collection. The program has been successful to date at Hickman, with clear successes and benefits, and further expansion is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As with most technological pursuits the real reason for success is people. We wish to offer sincerest thanks to the team at Nucor Hickman. The manager of the environmental department, Wayne Turney, and the department supervisor, Dan Bullock, have been particularly instrumental in the ongoing implementation. Dave DaVolt, Rod Wycoff, Claude Riggin, Justin Smith, Ashley Tippet, Tom Wright and Lou Incrocci in the hot mill, cold mill and melt shop have all contributed to the successful demonstration of these technologies. Likewise, success would have been impossible without the support, expert advice and consultation from the Nucor Hickman IT group. Rudy Moser, department manager, and Jim Walmsley, network support, were essential in making the implementation a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the part of Azima DLI, Dr. Ed Futcher and his development team created the tools to make the systems possible, and Heather De Jes&amp;uacute;s and Dave Geswein, Azima engineering, deployed the system at the mill. Nelson A. Baxter, vice president of diagnostics for Azima, was invaluable in technical support and expertise. Elsa Anzalone, account manager for Azima, made the case for what has been achieved in this project, and her contributions have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using vibration analysis to test for bearing wear</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This article discusses an example of an outer race-bearing defect on a 1,250-ton (4,400-kilowatt) air-conditioning chiller. The defect was detected using off-the-shelf portable vibration analysis hardware and software. The machine is a single-stage centrifugal compressor with a rolling element thrust bearing on the motor free end and a sleeve bearing on the motor drive end. This article discusses methods used to diagnose and trend the bearing defect using vibration spectra as an indicator of the bearing condition. The diagnostic methods covered are universally applicable to other types of machines (pumps, fans, gears) with rolling contact bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis Tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tools used to measure vibration have improved significantly in the past 25 years. The sensor of choice for most vibration data collection on industrial machinery is an accelerometer. As the name implies, the output is proportional to acceleration; however, it is normally integrated to display in units of velocity. All data shown in this case history was collected using a triaxial accelerometer cluster shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/32a4ba93-28b7-4c13-bece-0e067afea934_bearing1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/d80b5c95-094a-40b9-b1da-1f589f348625_bearing2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Sketch of a triaxial accelerometer cluster (left) that is stud-mounted to the bronze disk mounting pad (bottom right). The cluster contains three accelerometers, each mutually perpendicular to the others. Vibration data collection is activated using a bar code that automatically sets up the data collector, collects and then stores the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The notched mounting pad is adhered rigidly to the motor bearing housing, and the triaxial cluster is stud-mounted, allowing all three axes to be collected simultaneously. The bar code and mounting configuration allow accurate and repeatable data to be collected every time, regardless of the skill of the person doing the data collection. As long as the test conditions are relatively consistent, the test data also should be consistent if the mechanical condition remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The signal processing techniques used by a vibration analyst vary based on the level of detail desired. In routine predictive maintenance programs, two types of data typically are collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Overall level: &lt;/strong&gt;The overall level is a measure of the total vibration amplitude over a wide range of frequencies. An overall vibration measurement, also called a broadband level, is a single value that is relatively easy and cheap to collect, process, analyze and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Narrowband: &lt;/strong&gt;Using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the vibration signal is resolved into a number of discrete frequencies and displayed as a two-dimensional spectral plot of amplitude vs. frequency. All of the triaxial spectra shown in this case history have a frequency scale with 800 lines of resolution. In other words, each spectrum is composed of 800 individual peaks defining an amplitude at a specific frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Acceptance Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is an acceptable level of vibration for the 1,250-ton (4400-kW) chiller? The chiller manufacturer uses a pass/fail broadband specification of 0.25 inches/second (peak). Vibration tolerances or specifications typically are expressed as either absolute or relative criteria. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart, summarized in Table 1, is the most common example of absolute criteria and is a good guide for engineers who do not have any historical data on a machine. Each increment of machinery condition is represented by change of a factor of two in the vibration velocity. A third column provides an easy conversion between inches/second (peak) and the commonly used logarithmic unit of velocity decibels (VdB). Note that 6 dB also represents a change by a factor of two, so each machinery condition band is represented by a 6 dB differential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart is an improvement on a pass/fail criteria such as that used by the chiller manufacturer because it provides a graduated scale of machine condition. The tolerances in the chart are for frequencies between 1.6 and 1667 hertz and apply to most rotating machinery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While absolute criteria are fine for acceptance testing, more sensitive criteria are needed for making accurate diagnoses as part of a predictive maintenance program. A relative criterion is best if your goal is to diagnose machine health accurately. Relative criteria are defined by averaging vibration measurements taken on several identical machines, all tested under similar operating conditions. For this case history, the acceptance criteria were constructed by averaging spectral measurements from 12 identical chillers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bronze disk mounting pads were mounted in the same location on each machine and the data were collected with the chiller operating at about 80 percent rated load. The test spectra were developed into average baseline spectral data after manual review of the data, so each test showed the machines to be in reasonably good condition. Due to variations of test data among machines in the sample, standard deviations (sigma) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, an average plus one sigma spectral mask was calculated. Statistically, about 85 percent of the vibration amplitudes should fall below the average plus one sigma mask. Unlike vendor defined pass/fail criteria or absolute criteria such as the IRD chart, the relative criteria allow the machines themselves to define what is acceptable. Figure 3 is an example of one axis of the relative acceptance criteria used in this case history. Figure 4 shows the average and average plus sigma level for all three axes for both the low- and high-range data. If one or more peaks in an 800-line spectrum exceeds the average plus sigma amplitude criterion, that fact alone does not indicate a significant problem (see the section on diagnostic strategies).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Average baseline data from two separate facilities: Plant A (top 6 spectra) and Plant B (bottom 6 spectra). Each plant has 18 identical model chillers. The running speed of the Plant B data reflects a different average running speed (2,982 rpm), which reflects in input line frequency of 50 Hz common to Europe. This average and average plus sigma data is from the free end motor bearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Friction Bearing Problems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Bearing problems are some of the most common types of faults diagnosed by vibration analysis programs. In the early stages, a defective bearing will produce vibration components with frequencies that are not multiples of shaft rotation rate. The exact values of these non-synchronous frequencies are based on bearing geometry. They can be calculated if the race and roller dimensions are known. In practice, most facility engineers do not document the manufacturer and model number for bearings in machinery, and so must rely on other methods to determine bearing frequencies. A set of rules for determining approximate values of bearing tone frequencies follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race (BPFO)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Inner Race (BPFI)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Fundamental Train Frequency (FTF)&lt;br /&gt;
	= speed x 0.4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	The chiller manufacturer stated that the ball bearing in this case is an SKF 7318. The bearing table confirms that 4.9xM and 7.1xM are the outer and inner ball pass frequencies, respectively. These frequencies are presented as orders, where the suffix &amp;ldquo;xM&amp;rdquo; represents &amp;ldquo;times motor shaft rotation rate&amp;rdquo;. Looking at the frequencies and the rules of thumb, it is evident that this bearing has 12 rolling elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ball-bearing wear becomes increasingly evident as harmonics (integer multiples) of these ball-pass frequency peaks occur in the vibration spectra. Depending on the nature of the defect, there also may be strong 1xM sidebands around the bearing tones or their harmonics. Extreme bearing wear creates an abnormally high noise floor in the high-range spectra between about 70 and 100 times shaft rotation rate (70xM to 100xM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonly Used Diagnostic Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When evaluating bearing wear using vibration analysis, a consistent method of collecting and analyzing the data is necessary. Broadband vibration meters normally cannot detect bearing wear until the later stages. As a result, the maintenance technician has little warning to plan a repair, and risks catastrophic failure. Diagnostic techniques that rely on high-frequency phenomena such as shock pulse or ultrasonic energy are very effective at early detection of bearing wear. However, they typically lack the ability to detect the many machinery faults that manifest themselves with vibration at lower frequencies. Triaxial narrow band spectral analysis using relative acceptance criteria can accurately provide early warning of bearing defects. It also can be used to diagnose a wide range of other machinery problems such as imbalance, misalignment, impeller clearance problem, looseness and resonance. In this case, the third technique is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band data required for analysis includes two frequency ranges of high-resolution (800 lines) triaxial spectral data measured at a single point on a rigid part of the bearing housing. The low-range data is typically 0 to 10 orders of shaft speed where the fundamental bearing tones are easily seen. The high-range data is typically 0 to 100 orders of shaft speed, where the bearing tone harmonics and high-frequency noise floor are seen. While this may seem like an overkill of data for a single location, the mounting method and the bar code allow for simple and efficient data collection. Furthermore, processing the data on a PC is fast and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band fault model for a bearing defect, as taught in most basic vibration analysis courses, includes the following four conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonic series of peaks with a non-synchronous fundamental frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1xM and/or fundamental train frequency (FTF) sidebands around any of the peaks in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased high-frequency noise floor magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonics series of the shaft rotation rate caused by excessive bearing looseness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis (Human vs. Computer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The sheer quantity of narrow band data needed to accurately diagnose bearing defects requires that all the routine data reduction and logic functions are accomplished by a personal computer with an expert system. It is not time-economical for a human analyst to accomplish all the routine tasks that a computer can do in mere seconds. The first step is to order normalize the spectra with respect to the shaft rotating speed. The next step is to extract the amplitudes for the principal forcing frequencies and other peaks in the test data. The third step is to use the fault model described earlier to identify the pattern for a bearing defect. The last step is to determine the severity of the bearing defect, given that the pattern exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expert system logic used to identify the fault and its severity was created as part of an empirical process whereby the automated diagnosis on a large population of machines was compared to the diagnosis that a vibration expert would make on those same machines. The expert logic rules are, therefore, a reflection of exactly how a vibration expert would analyze the data. Because of this, an expert system can be no better than the vibration analyst who creates it. Because all the steps outlined in the previous paragraph are routine and repetitive, a modern computer can rapidly perform all four analysis steps in a few seconds per machine. The expert system then generates a text-based report for the chiller motor bearing wear as shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manual Review of the Spectral Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 6 shows the motor free end data collected on March 25 on Chiller 4. The Avg + sigma mask (red), are superimposed for comparison. The x-axis is scaled in units of orders where the order &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; represents the rotational rate of the motor. Note the prominent non-synchronous peaks in the axial low range data at 4.9xM and 7.1xM. These peaks correspond to the ball bearing pass frequencies for the motor bearing. In the high-range spectra, harmonic markers are placed on each peak of the harmonic series with 4.9xM spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note that the harmonic series has strong amplitudes in all three axes of the high range while only prominent in the axial direction in the low range data. The high-frequency noise floor is about the same or lower than the one sigma mask telling us that the bearing wear is not to a point of near failure; however, the strong harmonic series implies that a defect is present.&lt;/p&gt;

The three spectra on the left are low-range data and the three spectra on the right are high-range data. The marked peaks in the high-range data represent a 4.9xM spacing that is a BPFO harmonic series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prognostics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There is little doubt whether a bearing fault exists. The machine operators can identify this condition by sound and touch. A more important question is: How much remaining life does this bearing have? The clever vibration analyst will not make a conclusion until a trend has developed and several data sets are available. For each diagnosis, the expert system calculates a severity score based on three things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of peaks that support the diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The amount by which the criterion is exceeded for each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The absolute amplitude of each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A trend of the severity score is a good indicator of machine health. For each diagnostic rule template, the severity score is mapped into a severity scale that includes slight, moderate, serious and extreme. The algorithm used for determining severity was derived empirically for each diagnosis based on a large amount of test results that had been manually analyzed by vibration experts. If the indications (bearing tones, harmonics, sidebands and noise floor) of bearing wear increase over time, the expert system will recognize this fact and the severity assigned to the bearing wear diagnosis will increase. In the trend plot (Figure 7), the motor bearing wear fault severity has leveled off at a low serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/52ae1de5-66e4-4bba-901b-cba639be15f1_bearing7.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7. Expert System Trend Plot for Chiller 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The life expectancy of the bearing is mostly a function of the force on the bearing and the condition does not seem to be getting worse over the past year. Vibration analysis provides quantifiable evidence of the bearing condition and allows the owner to know the condition of his machinery. As the defect worsens, the bearing wear defect pattern will become more prominent. The expert system will respond by assigning a higher severity to the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chiller owner had called in a service engineer from the chiller manufacturer to measure vibration. Using an overall vibration meter, the technician told the owner that no problem existed with the bearing. The chiller manufacturer specifies an overall vibration maximum limit of 0.25 inch/second (peak). In this case, the overall level is probably less than the limit. This highlights one of the problems with using broadband measurements for predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broadband measurements completely missed the indications of bearing wear because broadband measurement is sensitive primarily to the highest peak seen in the spectrum. It does not see the BPFO harmonic series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To learn from this machine, and to obtain the maximum life from the bearing, the facility engineer must closely monitor this machine and compare its data to the average plus one standard deviation for this model of chiller. The expert system severity score is an excellent way to consistently trend the bearing health because it always applies the same logic and looks at a number of features in the data. When the severity increases toward the extreme level and a bearing replacement is ordered, the bearing should be saved and cut open for inspection. Possibly then, this case history would be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Diagnosing a boiler pump motor with an ultrasound detector</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In this video, a maintenance&amp;nbsp;technician uses the UL101, an ultrasound detector, to diagnose a thrust and non-thrust bearing in an injector boiler pump motor. He places the UL101 on the grease fitting and adjusts the UL101&amp;#39;s gain to the lowest possible setting. Lowering the gain setting will isolate the ultrasound to only the bearing being tested. Maintenance teams use the UL101, ultrasound detector, for quick troubleshooting on mechanical components.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Case study: Diagnosing a low-speed gearbox problem</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A few months ago, I was called on to help in the diagnosis of a suspected gearbox problem in a large plant connected with the paper industry. The gearbox in question had an input shaft with a 23-tooth pinion driving a large bull gear with 132 teeth which, in turn, drives another bull gear of the same size. The two gears are connected to large steel rollers about 24 inches in diameter. The two output gears turn at 52 rpm and the pinion turns at 302 rpm (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/e4a73325-6525-4040-a4fd-b8fe362f7bc3_gearbox_figure1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricating oil in the gearbox was regularly subjected to analysis, and the last report stated that there were iron particles in the oil. The maintenance supervisor asked if we could determine the source of the oil contamination, and the first thing we did was to examine the vibration spectra measured near the bearings. The spectra looked normal, without evidence of bearing tones, so we suspected that the metal was coming from one or more of the gears (see Figure 2). The problem then became to identify the faulty gear (if any), so as to allow the maintenance effort to proceed without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/ce84e4c5-2dcd-4ecf-8910-01fb1380e7b6_gearbox_figure2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Synchronous averaging of time domain signals has been around for a long time, but in my opinion, has not been used nearly enough for machine problem diagnosis. In any case, we decided to perform synchronous averaging of the gearbox vibration signature. This involves the use of a tachometer-derived synchronizing trigger in the vibration analyzer to collect of series of waveform samples that are averaged together. The important part of this is that the beginning of each time record must occur at exactly the same time in the rotation of the gear in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This allows the entire vibration signal that comes from the gear to be emphasized in the time domain average, and all the vibration components from the other gears, shaft rpm, and bearing tones, etc., to be averaged out. This produces a time waveform that shows the individual teeth on the gear, with very little contamination from other components from the machine. When doing synchronous averaging, the analysis parameters of the analyzer are adjusted so the time record length spans a little more time than one revolution on the gear. This is easily accomplished since the time record length (T) is the reciprocal of the FFT line spacing (DF) in the spectrum. It is simply a matter of choosing a frequency span and number of lines so 1/DF is longer than 1 divided by the gear speed in hertz (Hz). Of course, it is possible to look at the spectrum taken from a synchronized waveform, but we did not bother to do this since the waveform provided the needed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using synchronous averaging, the number of averages used must be quite large; usually in the vicinity of 100 or so. For the tests described here, we used 90 averages. (See Figure 3 for the setup details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/d5aa4517-d84e-445d-b62f-3f11e2987d23_gearbox_figure3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases of synchronous averaging, the time record is much more interesting that the spectrum, since the spectrum contains no time information, and the time domain shows any irregularities in the gear meshing. In this case, all the spectra were unremarkable, simply showing the gear mesh frequency and some harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we did synchronous averaging on each of the two bull gears, there was no indication of any defect in the waveform. But, when we performed the same test on the pinion, the waveform told another story. There was an obvious area on the gear where the meshing with the bull gear was very noisy and non-uniform (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/93fb2c27-5b70-4830-bb6c-04de63d335bc_gearbox_figure4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On looking at this data, we called for an inspection of the gear, but the maintenance chief was skeptical, saying that gearboxes with more vibration that this one had run for 20 years without any problems. But we insisted, and finally an access plate was removed so we could look at the gears. We found that the keyway in the pinion shaft was badly worn such that the gear could be rotated back and forth on the shaft by about one-half of a tooth at the edge of the gear. There was also visible clearance between the shaft and the bore of the pinion. The bull gears showed no sign of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We called one of the engineers at the gearbox factory and described the situation. He said the problem occurred during installation when the interference fit between the pinion and the shaft was too loose. He said the shaft and pinion would have to be replaced, and very soon, to avoid a catastrophic failure. This made believers out of the maintenance people who originally thought the gearbox need not be overhauled. From that time on, the vibration monitoring program at this plant has enjoyed a much increased popularity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned earlier, synchronous averaging is not a new technique, but it seems to be seldom used in industry. It is not a difficult thing to do, and can result in information about a machine that is almost impossible to obtain any other way. Furthermore, there are many analyzers on the market that do it, from small battery-powered units to larger mains-powered systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following photos of the pinion illustrate the damage:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CBM and RCM help to maximize safety, uptime at YICT</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Being one of the biggest single container terminals in the world brings certain expectations from the operators and customers alike. Professionalism, reliability and efficiency are three of the most important and, coupled with a high regard for safety, are major focus areas for the Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), in Shenzhen, southern China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With 74 mammoth sized cranes lining the five deep water berths and about 10 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers a year coming in and out of the terminal, it is an extremely complex task to keep everything running smoothly and safely. But the management of YICT have followed a Total Quality approach to their terminal from the early planning stages through the construction phase and into the running of daily operations. Today, Six Sigma is a guiding tool for process improvement to many things, including the entire maintenance strategy and operations, and their Quay Crane maintenance manager is a Six Sigma black belt. At the YICT Engineering Control Centre he has an ultra modern overview, via CCTV and other monitoring technologies, of many of the equipments and machinery, down to individual electric motors, needed to keep the terminal operating 24 hours round the clock .&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wide-ranging maintenance strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	YICT has applied and included all the various technique and technology in their maintenance strategy starting with time based, then adding condition-based (CBM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) that now ensure the right balance, from a cost and effectiveness viewpoint, for the vast array of equipment and systems under his supervision. One example the company gives is that a CBM approach to a particular gearbox allowed a solution to be made within 2 weeks, compared to 2 months at a port where a similar gearbox, operating on a time based maintenance program, failed unexpectedly. So although they had a potential failure to deal with, the financial and operational damage was only one quarter of that experienced at another port.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the ultimate techniques within a CBM and RCM program is continuous online monitoring, implying that the earliest signs of potential failure are recognized, and fast and adequate corrective action can be taken. It is not the answer to all maintenance concerns, but used wisely it is a very good investment to protect operationally critical or safety critical equipment. And this is an area that YICT has been moving into regarding their quayside cranes. They have now completed a three-year test period with SKF online monitoring technology on gearboxes on two cranes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety &amp;ndash; a key concern&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The monitored gearboxes are positioned 100 meters above ground in the &amp;lsquo;workhouse&amp;rsquo; of the huge dockside cranes. The gearboxes drive the roll drums that lower the heavy duty wire cable that is used to lift the heavy containers on and off the ships and container transport lorries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number one concern here is safety. A sudden failure or seizure of a gearbox could cause a container to swing away from its intended path of movement or drop some meters before the automatic braking system could hold the cable and container in place. With so many people constantly moving around the terminal such gearbox failures are a high priority to avoid. Additionally with a &amp;lsquo;suspended&amp;rsquo; container and an &amp;ldquo;out of commission&amp;rdquo; crane, there would be the loss of productive and throughput capacity to the terminal operators, the container owners and the end customers, who are waiting for the container goods to be delivered.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical components continuously monitored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A major potential cause of gearbox failure is some kind of failure of the bearings that support the gear shafts. Although bearings are high performing mechanical systems, like all machine components and systems they can wear or become damaged over time depending on various conditions of operation, loading, operating environment, etc. If left too long before replacement a catastrophic bearing failure can result that could lead to a gearbox failure and the potential dangers mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The SKF online system monitors the health of the gear shaft support bearings via vibration sensors placed at specific places on the outside of the gearbox housing. Bearings have particular vibration &amp;ldquo;signatures&amp;rdquo; when working well, working poorly or suffering from wear. And these signatures differ for different bearing types, sizes and loading conditions. So it is important to &amp;ldquo;trend&amp;rdquo; and study each bearing and its operating cycle separately to get a reliable picture of the health of each one. To do this, vibration data is sent to and stored on a server in the Engineering Control Center for later analysis. By constantly monitoring the vibration signals YICT has been able to confidently asses the health of the bearings and, with it, the potential of increasing or excessive bearing wear and associated gearbox failure. So far they have been able to happily continue running the gearboxes and no failures have occurred.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Because the loading and speed conditions of the gearbox varies during operation it requires special skills and knowledge to interpret the vibration signals correctly. SKF provided close support and advice to YICT engineers during the first year of running and remained on-hand during the next two years of operation. Additionally, YICT engineers attended SKF courses on condition monitoring to improve the own knowledge and skills levels.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving on with confidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Equipped now with fully trained condition monitoring engineers and three years confident experience, YICT is keen to expand the condition monitoring to more cranes and will investigate SKF&amp;rsquo;s latest technology. With 32 analogue channels and 16 digital channels, the new system will allow bearing, gearboxes and motors to be monitored at the same time, saving a lot of maintenance costs in the process. And this will be another step in YICT&amp;rsquo;s continuous process improvement Six Sigma-driven program that delivers professionalism, reliability, efficiency and safety to its port&amp;rsquo;s machinery and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/JvWDeY35Sb4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Fluke creates online glossary of vibration terms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Fluke Corporation has made available at its Web site a glossary of the key vibration terms that those involved in equipment maintenance and vibration diagnosis may encounter when evaluating machine vibration.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the world of mechanical maintenance, vibration remains one of the earliest indicators of a machine&amp;#39;s health and the effects of vibration can be severe. Unchecked machine vibration can accelerate rates of wear (i.e. reduce bearing life), damage equipment, create noise, cause safety problems and lead to degradation in plant working conditions. Vibration can cause machinery to consume excessive power and may damage product quality. In the worst cases, vibration can damage equipment so severely as to knock it out of service and halt plant production. Consequently, knowing the basic terminology of machine vibration and analysis is essential for anyone who is part of a preventive maintenance program or plant maintenance team.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Plant ensures reliability with predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	LCRA&amp;#39;s utility operations are full of electronic and moving parts. Making sure all those parts stay in working order is the job of predictive maintenance crews. Heat-sensing cameras and vibration detectors are just of couple of the modern tools the crews use to ensure the power and water stay on. Watch as a crew gives an irrigation pumping plant an end-of-season check-up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pump vibration testing in the shop </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A basic principle of machinery vibration analysis is evaluating whether specific vibration amplitudes are excessive. The use of vibration equipment in preventive maintenance involves keeping a vibration history on individual pieces of equipment in a plant, keeping a record of all PM heat and when the unit was greased and what type of grease was used.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing analysis kit provides oil and vibration condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit now is available, providing all the necessary equipment and consumables for oil and overall machine vibration condition monitoring. The kit is designed to provide fast, accurate results for multiple oil parameters, on-site maintenance decisions and assessment of overall machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supplied ready to use in a heavy-duty aluminum case, the SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit&amp;rsquo;s main feature is the SKF Machine Condition Advisor (MCA). The MCA simultaneously measures machine vibration signals and temperature to indicate machine health and bearing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complementing the MCA is a test cell, a lubrication assessment tool engineered to provide accurate results for Water-in-Oil (lubricants) and Total Base Number (TBN) tests. The water-in-oil test helps maintain equipment by indicating if water appears in lubricants, which enables intervention that protects the equipment from damage. &amp;nbsp;The Total Base Number provides an indication of the oil&amp;rsquo;s alkaline reserve and ability to neutralize acids from combustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit provides maintenance engineers with a condition monitoring solution that helps with on-site maintenance decisions to more effectively maintain plant equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Torsten Bark, product project manager, SKF. &amp;ldquo;Water contamination can cause various problems in lubricating oils, and the tools in the kit indentify those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the kit contains a Viscostick and Insolubles. The Viscostick provides a simple &amp;ldquo;go/no go&amp;rdquo; result when the distillate fuel dilutions of an SAE 30 to 40 engine oil is tested. The Insolubles detects high insolubles from diesel engine combustion products such as fuel ash, carbon, partially oxidized fuel, oil oxidation products and spent lubrication additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Phase analysis: Making vibration analysis easier</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is mostly a learned skill. It is based 70 percent on experience and 30 percent on classroom training and self study. It takes years to become a confident and competent vibration analyst. When the analysis is wrong, the recommendations for repair also will be incorrect. No vibration analyst wants to make the wrong call. In this business, credibility is gained in small steps and lost in large chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A vibration sensor placed on a bearing housing and connected to a vibration analyzer provides time, frequency and amplitude information in the form of a waveform and a spectrum (Figure 1). This data is the foundation for vibration analysis. It contains the signatures of nearly all mechanical and electrical defects present on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style2" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 1. Vibration Waveform and Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vibration analysis process involves determining the vibration severity, identifying frequencies and patterns, associating the peaks and patterns with mechanical or electrical components, forming conclusions and, if necessary, making recommendations for repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everybody involved in vibration analysis knows that analyzing vibration is not easy nor automated. Have you ever wondered why? Here are a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Machines Have Multiple Faults:&lt;/strong&gt; The vibration patterns we learn in training and read about in books just don&amp;rsquo;t look the same in the real world. We learn how mechanical and electrical faults look in the purest form &amp;ndash; as if there was always only that one problem on the machine causing vibration. Machines usually have more than one vibration-producing fault. At a minimum, all machines have some unbalance and misalignment. When other faults develop, the waveform and spectrum quickly become complicated and difficult to analyze. The data no longer matches the fault patterns we have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Cause and Effect Vibration:&lt;/strong&gt; For every action, there is a reaction. Some of the vibration we measure is the effect of other problems. For example, the force caused by rotor unbalance can make the machine look like it is out of alignment, loose or rubbing. Consider all of the things that shake and rattle on your car when one tire goes out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Many Fault Types Have Similar Patterns: &lt;/strong&gt;Because machine rotors rotate at a particular speed, and vibration is a cyclical force, many mechanical and electrical faults exhibit similar frequency patterns that make it difficult to distinguish one fault from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning to analyze vibration just takes time. Training courses, technical publications and other resources such as online resources and commercial self teaching material are available that can improve analysis skills and shorten the learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is one diagnostic technique which quickly gets to the source of most vibration problems. It is possibly the most powerful of all vibration diagnostic techniques. It has been around as long as vibration analysis itself yet hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten a lot of attention, and it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find good information about the subject. What is this technique? It&amp;rsquo;s called phase analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Phase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is the position of a rotating part at any instant with respect to a fixed point. Phase gives us the vibration direction. Tuning a car engine using a timing light and inductive sensor is an application of phase analysis (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 2. Engine tuning using a timing light is phase analysis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A phase study is a collection of phase measurements made on a machine or structure and evaluated to reveal information about relative motion between components. In vibration analysis, phase is measured using absolute or relative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Absolute phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured with one sensor and one tachometer referencing a mark on the rotating shaft (Figure 3). At each measurement point, the analyzer calculates the time between the tachometer trigger and the next positive waveform peak vibration. This time interval is converted to degrees and displayed as the absolute phase (Figure 4). Phase can be measured at shaft rotational frequency or any whole number multiple of shaft speed (synchronous frequencies). Absolute phase is required for rotor balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 3. Absolute Phase Measurement &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 4. Absolute phase is calculated between the tach signal and vibration waveform.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Relative phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured on a multi-channel vibration analyzer using two or more (similar type) vibration sensors. The analyzer must be able to measure cross-channel phase. One single-axis sensor serves as the fixed reference and is placed somewhere on the machine (typically on a bearing housing). Another single-axis or triaxial sensor is moved sequentially to all of the other test points (Figure 5). At each test point, the analyzer compares waveforms between the fixed and roving sensors. Relative phase is the time difference between the waveforms at a specific frequency converted to degrees (Figure 6). Relative phase does not require a tachometer so phase can be measured at any frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 5. Relative Phase Measurement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Relative Phase Calculated Between Two Vibration Waveforms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both types of phase measurements are easy to make. Relative phase is the most convenient way to measure phase on a machine because the machine does not need to be stopped to install reflective tape on the shaft. Phase can be measured at any frequency. Most single-channel vibration analyzers can measure absolute phase. Multi-channel vibration analyzers like the Pruftechnik VibXpert illustrated in Figure 7 have standard functions for measuring both absolute and relative phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 7. Pruftechnik VibXpert 2-Channel Vibration Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;When to use Phase Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Everyone needs phase analysis. A phase study should be made on problem machines when the source of the vibration is not clear or when it is necessary to confirm suspected sources of vibration. A phase study might include points measured only on the machine bearings or it can include points over the entire machine from the foundation up to the bearings. The following are examples of how phase can help analyze vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Soft Foot &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The term soft foot is used to describe machine frame distortion. It can be caused by a condition where the foot of a motor, pump or other component is not flat, square and tight to its mounting, or many other things, such as machining errors, bent or twisted feet and non-flat mounting surfaces. Soft foot increases vibration and puts undue stress on bearings, seals and couplings. Soft foot on a motor distorts the stator housing creating a non-uniform rotor to stator air gap resulting in vibration at two times line frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good laser shaft alignment system should be used to verify soft foot by loosening the machine feet one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase can be used to identify soft foot while the machine is in operation. Measure vertical phase between the foot and its mounting surface. If the joint is tight, the phase angle is the same between surfaces. If the phase angle is different by more than 20 degrees, the foot is loose or the machine frame is cracked or flimsy. Figure 8 is an example of the phase shift across a soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 8. A phase shift between the foot and mount may indicate soft foot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cocked Bearings and Bent Shafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect cocked bearings and bent shafts. Measure phase at four axial locations around the bearing housing. If the bearing is cocked or the shaft is bent through the bearing, the phase will be different at each location. If the shaft is straight and the bearing is not twisting, the phase will be the same at each location (Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 9. Phase identifies in-plane or twisting bearing motion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Confirm Imbalance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A once-per-revolution radial vibration usually means rotor unbalance. Use phase to prove imbalance is the problem. To confirm imbalance, measure the horizontal and vertical phase on a shaft or bearing housing. If the difference between the phase values is approximately 90 degrees, the problem is rotor unbalance (Figure 10). If the phase difference is closer to zero or 180 degrees, the vibration is caused by a reaction force. An eccentric pulley and shaft misalignment are examples of reaction forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 10. Horizontal to Vertical Phase Shift of about 90 Degrees Confirms Unbalance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Looseness, Bending or Twisting &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect loose joints on structures and bending or twisting due to weakness or resonance. To check for looseness, measure the vertical phase at each mechanical joint as indicated by the arrows in Figure 11. When joints are loose, there will be a phase shift of approximately 180 degrees. The phase angle will not change across a tight joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 11. A phase shift between bolted joints indicates looseness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shaft Misalignment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Shaft misalignment is easily verified with phase. Measure each bearing in the horizontal, vertical and axial directions. Record the values in a table or bubble diagram as shown in Figure 12. Compare the horizontal phase from bearing to bearing on each component and across the coupling. Repeat the comparison using vertical then axial data. Good alignment will show no substantial phase shift between bearings or across the coupling. The machine in Figure 12 has a 180-degree phase shift across the coupling in the radial directions. The axial directions are in-phase across the machine. The data indicates parallel (offset) shaft misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 12. Phase Data Indicates Parallel Shaft Misalignment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operational Deflection Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Instead of comparing the phase and magnitude numbers from a table or bubble diagram, operational deflection shape software (ODS) can be used to animate a machine drawing. An ODS is a measurement technique used to analyze the motion of rotating equipment and structures during normal operation. An ODS is an extension of phase analysis where a computer-generated model of the machine is animated with phase and magnitude data or simultaneously measured time waveforms. The animation is visually analyzed to diagnose problems. ODS testing is able to identify a wide variety of mechanical faults and resonance issues such as looseness, soft foot, broken welds, misalignment, unbalance, bending or twisting from resonance, structural weakness and foundation problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 13 is a simple ODS of three direct-coupled shafts. Phase and magnitude were measured from permanently mounted X and Y displacement probes on a turbine generator. The values listed in the table were used in ODS software to animate a stick figure drawing of the high- and low-pressure turbine shafts and the generator shaft. The picture to the right of the table is a capture from the ODS animation showing the vibration pattern of each shaft and the relative motion between shafts at 3,600 cycles per minute (turning speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 13. Shaft Operational Deflection Shape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many machines vibrate due to deteriorated foundations, looseness, resonance of the support structure and other problems that occur below the machine bearings. A phase study might include hundreds of test points measured all over the machine and foundation. Good ODS software can make it easier to analyze phase and magnitude data from a large number of test points. Analysis of an ODS involves observation and interpretation of the machine in motion. Figure 14 is an ODS structure drawing of a vertical pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 14. Vertical Pump Operational Deflection Shape Structure Drawing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition-based vibration testing is a vital component of a reliability based maintenance program. Vibration sensors, instruments and software are able to provide key information about machine health. The weak link in the chain is the analyst&amp;rsquo;s ability to interpret the data, accurately diagnose the problem and trend the fault until it is time to recommend corrective action. Phase analysis is a very powerful diagnostic tool. Every vibration analyst should be using phase to improve vibration analysis accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Vibration analysis is like winning the lottery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ah, to be able to predict the winning numbers in a lottery &amp;ndash; who hasn&amp;rsquo;t had that dream! Life would be so easy and carefree with a crystal ball. And, would not your maintenance job be so much simpler if you could just identify machine damage in time and predict the point at which repairs really become necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to DIN 31051, condition-oriented maintenance is not limited to inspection, servicing, determination of the machine condition and maintenance scheduling. It also encompasses predicting the length of service life remaining for machines and systems. This means it is not always necessary to replace a rolling bearing when an inspection measurement reveals inner raceway frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article describes how it was possible to keep a damaged bearing running for several months until the scheduled annual outage came around &amp;ndash; naturally under close observation. Periodic measurements had shown that there had only been a slight change in the envelope spectrum. But one thing at a time &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, a contractor was awarded a contract for the mobile condition measurement of a double-shaft extruder gear. So, before the diagnostic specialist carries out measurements on location, the gear construction data is established by way of the factory number and the bearing frequencies are calculated for the entire drive (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca111.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this purpose, the contractor used a computer program that recognizes almost all gear types, including variable speed drives. Having calculated the excitation frequencies, the diagnostic specialist visits the customer to determine the current condition of the drive &amp;ndash; which in this case was already 7 years old &amp;ndash; and to find any deviations. Beginning bearing damage was identified during control measurement as a result of the distinct, albeit not yet critical, vibrations of an inner raceway frequency that were picked up in the input shaft area. The gear condition was recorded and the recommendation to procure replacement parts for the intermediate shaft was made to the operator. Repeated monthly measurements were recommended to assess whether the bearing needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows two envelope spectra that were recorded three months apart at the same measuring point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca112.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Measured Values Recorded at a Three-month Interval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because changes were only slight, an immediate replacement of the bearing was not deemed necessary, and the decision was made to continue operation until the scheduled annual outage. The bearing was exchanged five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca113.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Dismantling the Intermediate Shaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon dismantling the bearing, the damage diagnosed on the inner raceway could be confirmed as expected &amp;ndash; nine months after initial diagnosis. Pittings are clearly visible on the inner raceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca114.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Inner Raceway with Diagnosed Pitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The extruder was back in operation two days later as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In hindsight, both the diagnosis and the predicted remaining service time proved to be correct and economically wise. Expensive &amp;ldquo;crash repair&amp;rdquo; was unnecessary in this case. And, avoiding downtime was almost like picking a &amp;ldquo;winning number&amp;rdquo; in the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>That's amore! Italian power plant loves new filter strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management&amp;rsquo;s AMS Suite: Equipment Performance Monitor is helping Centro Energia Teverola S.p.a. improve the efficiency of its 150-megawatt combined cycle co-generation power plant in Teverola, Italy. Using this combination of software and services has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to optimize its maintenance strategy for inlet filters on the gas turbines, contributing to an overall efficiency improvement of more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing that even a small increase in plant efficiency can provide a significant increase in operating profit, Centro Energia Teverola deployed AMS Performance Monitor to plan and monitor its maintenance practices, including evaluating the return on maintenance costs. An integral part of Emerson&amp;rsquo;s PlantWeb digital architecture, AMS Performance Monitor combines thermodynamic model-based software with support from Emerson experts to detect degraded machinery performance and aid predictive maintenance planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before Centro Energia Teverola adopted AMS Performance Monitor, unexpected performance degradation of the filters on gas turbines required emergency installation of replacement filters, resulting in costly downtime, especially during a peak production period. Emerson&amp;rsquo;s solution now monitors the gradual deterioration in filter performance and calculates the cost of the resulting reduction in turbine performance. By comparing this with the cost of the maintenance required, Centro Energia Teverola can determine the most appropriate point to replace the blocked filter. AMS Performance Monitor also makes it easy to establish the manpower required to complete individual maintenance projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance at the plant is now scheduled for periods when energy production is less profitable and penalties for being offline can be avoided. This improved planning also has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to reduce average repair times from seven hours to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With AMS Performance Monitor, the return on investment is very fast. A single filter change has already paid for this service for two years,&amp;rdquo; said Vincenzo Piscitelli, general manager, Centro Energia Teverola. &amp;ldquo;We can assess the effectiveness and economic return of our maintenance activities, which allows us to determine, in a strategic and effective way, what maintenance work is required to improve equipment performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a remote service, AMS Performance Monitor does not require complex hardware or software deployed on site. Instead, process data is sent to Emerson&amp;rsquo;s performance monitoring center of expertise, in Teesside, United Kingdom, where experienced engineers produce periodic reports showing monitored performance. These reports can be accessed via any standard Web browser and are based on thermodynamic models developed for each machine. In addition to the online information, Emerson also provides advice about the operational efficiency of machinery. Existing or potential problems are highlighted, as well as new opportunities to improve overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>System for non-destructive testing and measurement</title>

            <title>How to prevent costly downtime from power outages at petrochemical plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Unplanned downtime at petrochemical plants due to electric power failure is more common and costly than the total of fires, floods, earthquakes, network outages, service failures and hardware problems combined. Recent economic studies estimate the cost of downtime to the U.S. economy due to power outages exceeds $150 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hourly downtime cost in the petrochemical industry is calculated in the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the health and safety implications of outage incidents can include catastrophic accidents and releases, making the system vulnerable to subsequent outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A utility problem? Not hardly. Eighty percent of outages at industrial plants are the direct result of the distribution system inside the plant &amp;ndash; i.e., failed equipment and systems belonging to, and maintained by, the industrial plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Even in the electric utility industry, the overwhelming approach to power outages is mitigation &amp;ndash; not pre-emptive measures for prevention,&amp;rdquo; states John Lauletta, CEO of Exacter Inc., an international provider of outage-avoidance systems and services. &amp;ldquo;How can plant managers take advantage of utility-grade solutions, when most utility strategies are run-to-failure?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a variety of new solutions being developed in the utility industry using Exacter technology that identify failing equipment in the formative stages &amp;ndash; long before an outage incident. &amp;ldquo;Our system finds electrical signatures emitted from overhead lines that indicate equipment degradation, or pre-fail condition,&amp;rdquo; continues Lauletta. &amp;ldquo;After surveying over two million poles for more than 120 utilities over the last three years, our technology has helped to pre-empt thousands of power outages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With Exacter, petrochemical plants finally have a utility-grade early-warning system that allows them to remove failing equipment long before an outage shuts the plant down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Exacter finds failing equipment that visual, infrared, and other methods cannot identify &amp;ndash; meaning it will prevent outages that even the world&amp;rsquo;s best systems could not uncover,&amp;rdquo; states Exacter vice president Geoffrey Bibo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Exacter technology is not new to electric utilities, it is new to the petrochemical industry. &amp;ldquo;For plant applications, our field team conducts multiple physical surveys of the facility grounds each year. Equipment in pre-fail condition is identified, located, verified and photographed for easy preventive maintenance action,&amp;rdquo; says Bibo. &amp;ldquo;The technology has been field-verified to be 100% accurate, and it&amp;rsquo;s the most far-reaching, pre-emptive measure for outage prevention in the petrochemical industry.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/udWF-v75scY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Static and dynamic testing as part of PdM programs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Predictive maintenance programs (PMPs) are becoming universally accepted as the best method for maintaining motor reliability within most modern plants and facilities. A complete PMP will include as many technologies as possible, with each technology providing vital pieces to the diagnostic puzzle. Periodic static testing and more aggressive dynamic testing of motors are essential parts of predicting the potential for a motor to continue a safe and successful operation. Tracking and trending the results of electric motor testing on a regular schedule is the most effective method of making intelligent predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The need for motor testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The steady, safe and efficient operation of electric motors is essential to the productivity of all plants and facilities. Some facilities have many critical and/or expensive motors. A motor failure could be catastrophic, causing lost production and costly emergency repairs. For example, a motor failure at a nuclear plant can cost up to $1 million a day for critical motors and may have a disastrous, long-lasting impact. Even failures at a wastewater treatment facility can have a huge, negative environmental effect and can be very costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motors fail due to numerous operational circumstances, including power condition, mechanical influences and environmental hazards. According to IEEE&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and EPRI&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; studies, at least 35 to 45 percent of motor failures are electrically related. Monitoring the motors &amp;ldquo;electrical health&amp;rdquo; is, unquestionably, an important and vital consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trending the historical operating condition of a motor makes early detection of any decline in the motors &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; possible. Planning downtime and having only minor reconditioning repairs instead of a major rewind or replacement is far less expensive in both repair costs and lost production. Since electric motors begin deteriorating the instant they are started, it is necessary to monitor their operating condition on a routine, periodic schedule. Periodic monitoring and trending of data collected and properly diagnosed provides the technician with evidence needed to prepare for downtime before a catastrophe occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is no longer practical to just &amp;ldquo;megger&amp;rdquo; a motor in order to determine its condition. Plants and facilities depend on a complete predictive maintenance program (PMP) to monitor their operations and plan their repair schedules. A good PMP requires both static (and off-line) and dynamic (or on-line) testing, with educated and trained technicians monitoring data routinely, with quality equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides voltages and currents, on-line test equipment must be able to capture and trend torque ripple and torque signatures as well as rotor bar sidebands. Off-line testing with modern, high-voltage test equipment is essential to getting reliable data. The voltages required to properly test motor windings cannot be reached with impedance-based or low-voltage test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective dynamic test equipment must be able to collect and trend all essential data that affects the operation of electric motors. Power condition &amp;ndash; including voltage level, voltage imbalance and harmonic distortions, current levels and current imbalances, load levels, torque signatures, rotor bar signatures, service factors and efficiencies &amp;ndash; should be tracked and trended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On-line testing is performed at the motor&amp;rsquo;s MCC, at the load side of a variable frequency drive or at an installed port, which allows for on-line testing without opening the MCC. Data is collected through a set of current transformers and corresponding voltage probes. The data collected, processed and analyzed provides the technician with an overall view of the normal operational environment to which the motor is subjected on a daily basis and of how the motor is responding within this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, a motor is subjected to incoming power problems including low or high voltages, voltage imbalances and harmonic distortions. Lower voltages cause higher currents and, therefore, more heat. Higher voltages cause lower power factors and ultimately higher losses. A small amount of voltage imbalance creates an exponential amount of current imbalance which causes temperature increases. Harmonic distortion also causes thermal stress in motors. Any of these voltage problems can cause severe overheating in the motor even without factually reaching an over-load situation, and excessive heat is the insulation&amp;rsquo;s major enemy. Some motors are subjected to physical obstacles that cause undue stress. Over-greasing, misalignment and over-tightened belts all cause thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many motor failures can be traced to load related situations. Erratic torque signatures can be an indicator of load-related problems. Broken or cracked rotor bars also can cause premature motor failures. On-line testing identifies these problems, and routine trending will reveal the rate of decline. Of major importance to the overall health of a motor also is the &amp;ldquo;effective service factor.&amp;rdquo; Two elements affect the service factor number are: real operating power condition (voltage quality) and steady state load conditions. The effective service factor number represents the thermal stress caused by these two conditions on the motor. On-line testing can find and trend all of these motor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing schedules should be tailored individually according to operating time, criticality and any other important element of operation. Generally, an on-line test should be performed at least quarterly. Motors that begin to show obvious decline or thermal over-stressing should be monitored more closely until the motor can be statically tested or removed from operation and repaired. New and recently repaired motors should be tested as soon as they are returned to service in order to provide a historical record (or baseline) of their performance when the motor is at its &amp;ldquo;best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Off-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In general, motors are quite reliable, and when properly maintained, you should expect at least 100,000 hours of continual operation. That is to say, a new motor operated within nameplate parameters should give us at least 11 years of steady use. Unfortunately, motors are almost always subjected to a variety of damaging elements, with the end result being a rise in operating temperature. Thermal aging of the insulation is the major cause of insulation failure. Years of testing and numerous studies have shown that, as a &amp;ldquo;rule of thumb,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;for every 10 degrees centigrade increase in temperature, the winding life is decreased in half.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides thermal problems, other causes of insulation failures include incoming line related problems. Spikes caused by lightning and surges created by switching and contactor closing contribute to insulation breakdown. Motors also are subjected to mechanical influences including bearing failure, environmental hazards and magnet wire damage caused during the manufacturing process. Even the physical movements of the windings during startups causes wear to the insulation system, especially the magnet-wire insulation, as D.E. Crawford has shown.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper testing of all components of a motor requires a series of tests designed to emulate the conditions the motor will see in the field. It has been proved in numerous studies that low-voltage testing, including capacitance, inductance, impedance, etc., are not effective tools in verifying insulation problems. Quality off-line test equipment will be able to perform winding resistance tests, insulation-resistance tests, high-potential (HiPot) tests, polarization index, and surge tests at IEEE, NEMA and EASA accepted standards. Top-quality test equipment will automatically run a series of preprogrammed tests and provide a complete final report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This automatic equipment will stop testing before any damage is done to the windings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resistance test verifies the existence of dead shorts within the turn-to-turn coils and shows any imbalances between phases due to turn count differences, along with locating poor wire connections or contacts and finds open parallel coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DC insulation resistance testing detects faults in ground wall insulation or motors that have already failed to ground. Weak ground wall insulation (prior to copper-to-ground failure) can only be found successfully with the HiPot tests. The ground wall insulation system consists of the magnet wires insulation, slot liner insulation, wedges, varnish and often phase paper. DC HiPot test should be performed at twice line voltage plus 1,000 volts since motors will see voltage spikes of at least that level during each startup. HiPot testing is necessary to verify winding suitability for continued service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Surge testing detects faults in both inter-turn winding and phase-to-phase insulation systems. Turn-to-turn faults will not be seen by a megger or HiPot test. Potential faults can only be seen when the coils see more than 350 volts from turn-to-turn or coil-to-coil, as described by Paschen&amp;rsquo;s Law &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Figure 1). The typical mechanism of fault progression is a turn-to-turn short, causing excessive heat and progressing within seconds or minutes to copper to ground faults. Faults are much more likely to occur between turn-to-turn winding coils due to the added stress caused by bending and exaggerated during the winding process. The ground wall insulation is generally many times stronger and more capable of withstanding voltage spikes and other stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Integrating on-line and off-line testing into a predictive maintenance program provides the technician with verification of his motor&amp;rsquo;s condition (see case studies below). Both technologies are necessary in order to have a complete picture of a motor&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Collecting both on-line and off-line data on a routine schedule allows for early warning of impending failures and opens the opportunity window for planned downtime. Performing resistance, HiPot and surge testing along with dynamic testing provides the technician with a total picture of the motor&amp;rsquo;s condition and allows him or her to track its rate of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern test equipment includes enhanced and detailed reporting. Reports are easily generated, providing a written hard copy of test results and making diagnosing and comparing of data clearer and more accurate. Setting up and managing a program to monitor the motors within any facility is essential to insure the safe and continued operation and production of the facility. In most cases, a properly managed and operated PMP will save a plant or facility much more than it will cost to implement, administer and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	1) At a large wastewater treatment facility in Florida, 14 identical motors were scheduled for predictive maintenance. These motors were 40-horsepower aerators for a large treatment tank and operated continuously. Static tests were performed on all 14, and each received passing marks on all tests. When dynamic testing was complete, it was noted that 13 motors were acting very similar running within expected parameters at approximately 85 percent load, while the 14th motor was running at just over 30 percent load. Further inspection revealed a sheared coupling on the motor running at reduced load. The operators had no way of detecting the problem, and the location of these motors made visual inspection difficult. The dynamic testing found a problem that was costing the customer both in wasted kilowatt usage and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Twelve 60-horsepower pump/motors were tested at a large office building. Six were chilled water pump/motors and six were condenser water circulating pump/motors. All 12 were installed at the same time and ran continuously. Dynamic testing was performed one day on all 12, and all appeared to be operating within expected parameters. The motors were shut down for a scheduled annual routine building maintenance, and static testing was planned for the following morning. Resistance tests appeared normal on all, but two would not pass HiPot testing at the preset voltage. Three others failed the surge tests. The five motors were removed from service, disassembled and inspected. Two were found to be extremely dirty, while three had no visual damage. All five were reconditioned, retested and replaced in service. The off-line testing prevented five potential catastrophic failures and allowed the customer to dictate the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						A large steel mill wanted to make every machine ready for easy oil sampling. After installing more than 1,200 new oil sampling ports, it began getting strange data on oil analysis reports. After investigating, it found that each of the new sampling ports was installed in the wrong location.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						A company that had been using oil analysis for several years wondered why it was never able to detect pending bearing failures. After a bearing failure shut down production for more than a day, it discovered that the oil analysis tests being conducted were not capable of detecting impending failure. Instead, the tests were designed to identify wrong or degraded lubricants only.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					&lt;strong&gt;The Experts Agree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
					Oil analysis offers far superior early warning signals than other maintenance tools - including vibration analysis. Learn how to get maximum benefits at this intensive three day course.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Creating a lean but effective oil analysis program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a budget issue, management buy-in, lack of individuals or just a small company with limited funds, there are ways to establish an effective oil analysis program with minimal startup and operation costs. In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll read case studies on alternatives to expensive in-house test equipment, good utilization of outside labs, oil storage solutions, methods of reporting findings to further the program, selling the program to upper management as well as to operations and maintenance, and starting over again when your facility is sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This article will cover the steps I experienced setting up our oil analysis program, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purpose of an oil analysis program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our attempts to set up a state-of-the-art program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		My course of action after management turned down our original plan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment employed in a lean oil analysis program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Current program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of an oil analysis program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In my opinion, reliability is the No. 1 reason we perform predictive maintenance. Uptime is the only way to compete in today&amp;rsquo;s highly competitive world. Detecting problems and preventing failures are ways to get the most uptime possible from our equipment. Along with uptime, reducing cost is also important to the profitability of any company. If an equipment problem can be detected early, it can be scheduled for repair or replacement before it causes expensive downtime or equipment damage. The ultimate goal would be to run each component as long as possible and be able to predict in advance when it needs to be changed. This also includes the oil. More and more, the oil is becoming a very expensive component of any piece of equipment; getting the longest life you can out of oil is no different than a bearing or a gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cost of a predictive maintenance program also adds to production costs and is scrutinized more than other expenses, as it is not looked at as being directly related to production. Unlike vibration and thermography, oil analysis usually requires an outside lab to perform the tests for analyzing the samples. It is imperative to show success early and it must be communicated quickly not only to management but also to production and maintenance. Getting support from production and maintenance will go a long way in selling management on spending money for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So if you are a small company with not a lot of capital to work with, a larger company dealing with cost control, no support of the predictive maintenance by management or, in some cases, there is a combination of issues that keep you from starting or maintaining a predictive maintenance program, success can be achieved with a little determination and a little thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To start with, I will give you a little history on how I had to set up a lean oil analysis program, what led to it, how it progressed and the success achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Our attempt at a world-class program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In my case, the problems kept changing as our company grew and then was sold twice. At the beginning, we were set up to be a fully cross-craft maintenance, and every technician would be an expert in every aspect of maintenance, including predictive. Everyone was given some basic training on vibration, alignment and oil analysis. It was very evident to us that only certain techs were interested in each of the disciplines, but everyone was expected to complete whatever work order they were given. This produced very erratic trending and even worse analysis of the data. Many motors, bearings and reducers were diagnosed incorrectly, wasting labor, materials and reducing reliability. Management was still sold on having everyone as an expert in every discipline of maintenance. To achieve this, they planned to send two techs at a time to training. Fortunately, the first two sent to vibration as well as the two sent to oil analysis training were passionate about the process. They took ownership of each of the programs and were able to achieve some early success, but no one was allowed to be a dedicated predictive maintenance tech; we still had every maintenance tech collecting data and doing the analysis. Whenever there was an alarm condition, the reply was, &amp;ldquo;Change the oil,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Change the motor,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Run it and watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The change began when two of the people picked for the original training &amp;ndash; one oil analysis and one vibration &amp;ndash; decided to take matters into their own hands. Thinking back to what made us do this behind management&amp;rsquo;s back, it had to be a passion for the predictive maintenance process, or maybe just the thrill of getting away with something. Some of the original group trained in oil analysis and vibration lost interest in the programs because management wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to invest in the equipment needed or staff the program full time. Even after putting together a proposal that showed all the benefits and payback of a full-fledged program, management maintained their philosophy of a full cross-craft maintenance department with no specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Before Picture of Clarion Boards&amp;#39; Oil Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Change of plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another train of thought was to go slow and convince management through results. The methods used were a little different and required some risk, going behind the back of management, but they had encouraged us to be a self-directed workforce. All techs at our mill were on-shift and worked 12-hour rotating shifts. Management works straight days and no weekends, which left us to manage ourselves nights and weekends. This gave us a great opportunity to get our oil analysis programs set up using non-traditional means. I would get my scheduled work done as quickly as possible or recruit the other techs on my shift to help out with the scheduled work so I could spend a little time each shift on the setup of the program. I also volunteered to perform all oil change preventive maintenance (PM) tasks on down days. This provided me the opportunity to design and install oil sampling ports on all of our equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this process, we found some support from our corporate office. We started asking questions of the industrial training department, which sparked some interest in what we were doing, and questions were asked of our supervisors about progress. For example, they wanted to know how many sampling points we had for our vibration and how many sampling ports were installed on equipment for oil analysis. When my supervisor was given a pat on the back for having 150 sampling ports installed in equipment, he was surprised and confused and wanted to know how this was achieved without him knowing. After seeing the interest corporate showed, he began the process of dedicating a couple of techs to the predictive maintenance process. He ran into the same resistance with mill management that we had in the past (no specialist), but because pressure was being applied from corporate, his proposal was pushed through, with some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan agreed on by the managers at our facility was a three-month, three-person team to work day shift, to set up and start the PdM program. After three months, three more techs would be brought off-shift, and they would continue with the program. This rotation would continue with our entire maintenance staff. Only three people applied for the positions; the rest knew that management was only doing this because of corporate pressure and would not give the program support needed to succeed. After accepting the position and listening to the rules and restrictions, we went to work developing the program with one goal in mind &amp;ndash; no matter what obstacles they gave us, we would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were told right away that there would be no money for the PdM program. We had to use the equipment and resources we already had. Our first goal was to use what tools we had to show success as quickly as we could. Working with the oil supplier, which gave us free oil testing (which turned out to be worth exactly what we paid for), I spent my time working on perfecting the data-collection process. Keeping the samples clean and getting them to the lab quickly gave me somewhat of a stable trend on most of the equipment. Having one person collect all the data gave us a more stable trend as opposed to having every maintenance tech collect the data. On most of the equipment, I was able to get a nice trend except for the lab deviations &amp;ndash; the free oil-testing thing. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into that a little later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My next step was to develop a report where we could show all of our success and savings for the company. I used very conservative figures when estimating the money saved or downtime averted. I would make sure the report was sent to management as well as maintenance and process techs. To promote the program, I also forwarded the reports to the industrial training center at our corporate headquarters, which, with their help, went on up the ladder. This created some issues with our plant management, but it secured our place because they could not justify shutting us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the quickest ways to show a savings turned out to be a benefit from having so many sampling ports installed in our equipment. Every reducer, from the largest to the smallest, as well as every hydraulic and lube system had a sampling port installed. Samples could be taken while the equipment was running. I was able to set up all of this equipment for condition-based oil changes. The OEM-recommended oil changes for the majority of our hydraulic system came due about this same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using the lab results, I was able to show that all of the hydraulic oil in the systems was as good as new. The total oil for these systems was more than 900 gallons. To this day, 11 years after startup, we are still running with the original fill on the hydraulic systems. Going to condition-based oil changes reduced our oil consumption by about 70 percent in the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The oil storage room became my room as no one else wanted to take ownership of the mess. We had a separate building attached to the side of our plant just for storing our oil. This room became a hiding place for everything messy. Some of our systems produced a lot of waste oil contaminated with wood fiber as part of the process. This waste along with other waste oil was everywhere in the storage building, along with our new oil and containers used to fill systems. I had to take charge of the oil room if I was going to have any success with the oil analysis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of our sister mills had an oil storage system that consisted of storage tanks built into a nice racking system with hoses and pumps to transfer and keep the oils clean. My purchase request for this system was turned down, so I set out to use what we had and, using some ideas from Noria training, designed my own storage system. Adding legs to the drum rack system we had, I set out to clean up the oil storage room. I was able to purchase a new waste oil tank as well as some storage cabinets and over time purchased dedicated oil transfer containers. The finished oil room (Figure 2) eventually became the standard for the entire company, including our sister mill. They had to give up their fancy storage system and replace it with this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Oil Room After Taking Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I set my sights on improving sampling, testing and analysis. I had approximately 100 samples to take each month to keep a close watch on our equipment and to manage the condition-based oil changes of all our equipment. This meant that we would run out of our free samples in about five months. I projected out what it would then cost to continue the program for the other seven months of the year. Particle count testing was not part of the free sample deal, and there would be a charge for this test to be added to the package for all samples. As I mentioned earlier, our free lab service we had with our oil supplier was worth exactly what we paid for it. Now we were going to have to pay for the tests, particle count for the first 500 and then full price for all samples after that. I needed to find out if the lab service they offered was going to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having all the data collected by one person, the trending started to level out, but I was still seeing test results at times that were all over the place. Unable to contact the lab, except through our oil representative, I decided to run a simple test to see how reliable the results were that we were getting from the lab. After pulling enough oil from a new drum of oil to make four samples, I sent them into the lab for testing. Before separating the oil into four bottles, I thoroughly agitated the oil. The results I got back were all different. Particle counts, viscosity and additives results were all over the place. I ran this same test in qualifying an independent lab. I picked the lab with the best repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still not having a budget to work with, I put together a proposal that would get us some in-house testing, along with support of an independent lab with very little investment. I compared the cost of a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Full in-house lab with all the necessary equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An independent lab doing all the lab work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our current system projecting out the fact that we would run through our free samples half way through the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These all turned out to be very expensive and were all turned down by management. I started looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lean equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If I could come up with a way to do some in-house testing and only use an outside lab for very critical and questionable samples, I would get more useful data at a lower cost. The criteria I set for my in-house test equipment was repeatability, ease of use and being able to perform tests quickly. Repeatability would be the biggest factor. Knowing that every test was accurate was a must. The three tests I felt were needed to have an effective in-house program were viscosity, particle count and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Viscosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Viscosity can be measured using a visgage, a handheld unit with two tubes each containing a steel ball. One of the tubes is filled with a reference fluid; the other can be filled with the fluid to be tested. After tipping the gauge to get the balls to the one end, the gauge is held at a 45-degree angle until one of the balls reaches the end of the gauge scale; the other ball will indicate the viscosity of the fluid. When sending out a sample to the lab, I would use the visgage and record the data and compare it with the test results from the lab. I was surprised how accurate the visgage was with a little practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lander003.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Two visgages were purchased through an online auction &amp;ndash; one in centistokes and the other in Saybolt seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Patch test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After reading an article about patch tests, I decided to look into what equipment was needed, how accurate the tests were and if the results were repeatable. I also needed a way to trend data viewed in the patch. I found a microscope on the Internet that had a digital camera that connected to a personal computer. With the camera attachment, I was able to save the patch images and trend any changes. I also found that a top light is necessary to see and identify particles on the patch. A small handheld magnet moved alongside the microscope would make the ferrous metals dance. Using the top and the bottom lights and either the 100 times or 400 times lenses helps to identify the type of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before testing a sample, it needs to be agitated. I found very early on that the proper agitation of the sample makes a big difference in the accuracy and repeatability of the tests. I priced commercial agitators and found them to be quite expensive. Our vibration tech made a vibration training station from a discarded reducer and an old motor. The output of the reducer turned very slow, attaching a wheel to hold the sample bottles; the slow rotation agitated the samples as well as any vibrating shaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The patch test became the backbone of my program. I used the patch to check the sample for contamination, wear debris and to perform a rudimentary particle count. Using the digital image to store and trend the collected data made it easier to detect a change in the equipment condition. If something out of the ordinary is observed, then the sample can be sent to the lab. Because the patch test uses so little of the sample, there is still enough left to send to a lab for further testing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are patch test atlases available to assist in the identifying of contamination and wear debris. Actual images of the different types of wear debris can help you identify what you are seeing in the microscope. To get a feel for estimating the particle content of a fluid, I would send the sample off to the lab and compare my estimate to the actual from the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lander004.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I found two methods to make patches. One consisted of a funnel-shaped patch holder that used gravity or a vacuum to run the fluid through the patch. This worked well but had several issues: time, cleanup and exposure. Using gravity to get the fluid through the patch took time and was very dependent on having the right amount of thinning fluid added to the sample to make it thin enough to go through the patch. Cleaning the funnel between tests not only required time but could also affect the next sample if any residue is left. Pouring, mixing and the time the sample is exposed to the air can affect patch results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second method, using a syringe with a two-way check valve, solved all of the issues I had with the funnel method. With the two-way check valve, I can draw up the right amount of oil and then thin fluid in the syringe as well as push it through the patch with minimal exposure to the atmosphere. Cleaning the syringe is very easy and quick, in addition to purging all fluid and contamination quickly using the same method. It only takes a few minutes to create a patch ready for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lander005.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. This bottle agitator was built in-house using discarded parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Moisture test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Testing oil for water can also be simply done in-house. Water in the systems I test in-house is not as critical as those I send to the lab. Small reducers running under normal load can handle a small amount of moisture without too much trouble. However, for reliability checking to make sure moisture is not an issue, I use the crackle test. A couple drops of oil placed on a hot plate set to the right temperature will give you a quick check for the presence of water. Having a magnifying light over the hot plate not only protects you from the hot oil but also gives you a better view of the test. I also have used this in emergency tests for our critical equipment to test for a cooling water leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The in-house test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A typical oil sample would go through the following steps after collection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Visual test: &lt;/strong&gt;Look at the color and clarity of the oil. For this purpose, I use clear bottles only. I have a rack of new oil samples handy for comparison and record any change in color. Loss of clarity can indicate contamination by water, wear particles, dirt or wrong top off oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Smell test:&lt;/strong&gt; This can reveal issues with contamination, oxidation and varnish. Samples of new oil come in handy for this test as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Viscosity: &lt;/strong&gt;Use the visgage to test the viscosity and record the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Crackle test:&lt;/strong&gt; Deposit a couple of drops from the visgage unto the hot plate and check for water in the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Patch test:&lt;/strong&gt; Produce a patch and analyze. Check for ferrous metals, using a magnet, and record the amount and size of particles. Look for and record the amount of other contaminants on the patch. Save the image to a database for trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Report: &lt;/strong&gt;This is probably one of the most important parts of keeping the program running. Reporting findings and successes will generate a lot of interest in the program. Keep reports short and to the point. Usually only the first page of a report gets read, so try to keep it to one page and cover your successes. I found that sending the reports to management to process helps in keeping everyone aware of the success of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Starting over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Shortly after getting everything working well and getting experience with the equipment, we were shut down. Market issues caused the shutdown, which lasted 18 months. When we were finally sold, half of the maintenance techs did not return. In September 2004, we restarted the mill; and to this day, we are still trying to restaff our maintenance department. Again, I have to start over-selling the importance of oil analysis to management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Finding the right person for the job is key to success. To make it work in a lean environment requires someone who is dedicated and has a passion for the process of oil analysis. Currently, I am still looking for the right person to fill this position &amp;ndash; someone who is willing to take ownership of the oil storage, take charge of the setting up the sampling, testing and reporting as well as someone who can think outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Datastick announces machine vibration seminar in California July 20-23</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A four-day Machine Vibration seminar with hands-on practical experience will be held on July 20 through 23 in San Jose, Calif. Attendees can become certified as Level I vibration analysts by taking a test on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analyzing the vibration of rotating and reciprocating machinery provides an early warning system that alerts maintenance and reliability managers to machine health problems to help avoid costly, sudden breakdowns. Datastick&amp;rsquo;s handheld VSA Vibration Spectrum Analyzer will be used in the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four-day seminar includes hands-on practice as well as training on the basics of vibration, such as: what is an FFT; waveform vs. spectrum; an introduction to spectrum analysis; when and how to use the displacement, velocity and acceleration domains; and how to set up and manage inspection routes. Also covered are: effective sensor placement, onsite troubleshooting, detection of unbalance, eccentric rotors, gear wear and bearing failure, as well as how to measure vibration, create reports, and analyze the results to determine the likely cause of machine function problems such as resonance, rotor bar issues, and more. A full agenda can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.datastick.com/training"&gt;www.datastick.com/training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, predictive maintenance and Reliability-Centered Maintenance programs are replacing run-to-failure methods &amp;ndash; as well as preventive maintenance methods that were based on taking a piece of equipment offline for costly service, regardless of condition, after a certain number of hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hands-on practical experience is important to effective training, and this seminar provides it,&amp;rdquo; said Penny Melrose, CEO of Datastick Systems. &amp;ldquo;The Datastick VSA is an excellent tool for someone new to vibration because of its extremely fast learning curve and exceptional ease of use, along with full analysis comparable to or better than some analyzers at more than double the cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The course and exam meet the ISO 18436-2 and the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) SNT-TC-1A standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Datastick Systems Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>UE launches Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Using knowledge based on three decades of experience, the engineers at UE Systems have developed an entire ultrasonic condition monitoring laboratory &amp;ndash; to fit in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The latest advancement from the manufacturers of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading ultrasonic detection instruments, the Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch provides plant inspection professionals the ability to use iPhone like Touch Screen technology to analyze conditions with a wide range of on-board features including: a spectral analyzer, the ability to take equipment temperature with an infrared thermometer, photograph test points with an on-board camera, select from multiple data screens including dB, temperature, and spectral analysis, pinpoint locations with a laser pointer, store data, sounds, and images, generate reports, review historical record data, plan/review routes, review alarm groups for planning corrective actions, adjust emissivity, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Used for all plant applications, the Touch is something truly special. &amp;ldquo;We are very proud and privileged to introduce such powerful, intuitive technology to plant maintenance professionals&amp;rdquo;, said Alan Bandes, vice president of marketing for UE Systems. &amp;ldquo;Truly a full-featured inspection system, the (Ultraprobe 15,000) Touch takes the most necessary components of ultrasonic inspection and simplifies the process to intuitively guide inspectors through their routes more quickly and effectively.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip on spectral band alarms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When reviewing spectral data rich with peaks from an unknown origin, consider establishing band alarms around these peaks. Properly designed and applied band alarms allow varied severity indications for a range of frequencies. If the application being monitored is operating in an otherwise healthy condition, then an increase of 25 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent from baseline could be used for observe, caution and severe setpoints, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Audible, visual and tactile inspections for PdM personnel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is the backbone of any vibration monitoring effort, yet opportunities to gather additional data while at the machine are typically ignored. Is the vibration industry finally beginning to feel the effects of the pure data collector who has not transitioned into the reliability group from the mechanical trades? What about the site operators and craftsman? This paper covers basic inspection techniques that can be applied to optimize time spent in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations separate personnel who perform technology monitoring into a predictive maintenance (PdM) team or reliability group. Their job is to periodically collect machinery information using various forms of technology and use this data to assess the condition of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Different technologies exist for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical components, and especially for detecting impending failure. Each technology has it own applications, advantages and disadvantages. Effective condition monitoring makes use of multiple techniques and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An under-utilized group of checks that provide valuable data are basic visual, audible and tactile inspections. These inspections can be performed and used to supplement the formal technology inspections. The key to successful implementation of a visual, audible and tactile inspection program is training the participants on the basic operation of the component to be inspected and following a list of items to be checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition monitoring steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective condition monitoring programs consist of four major elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to thoroughly understand each of these elements. Valuable time is too often wasted when too much emphasis is placed on any one component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many problems can be found using visual, audible and tactile inspections. The goal is to identify bad machines or identify deteriorating conditions. The question becomes how to quantify the results of these inspections. Technologies like vibration, thermography, ultrasound, oil analysis and motor circuit testing may be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After identifying machines in need of further analysis using detection, the next step is to determine the root cause of the problem. This is achieved during the analysis phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1. Problem Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The purpose of performing an analysis is to determine the root cause of the problem. The analysis phase involves studying the machine&amp;rsquo;s operation, defect characteristics, maintenance history, etc. Only the machines indicating problems should be analyzed. Once the analysis is complete and the root cause of the problem found, the results should be communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2. Problem Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction/Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, it can be corrected. The most common problems require balancing and/or precision alignment. In order to maximize the reliability of the machine in question, it is also advisable to improve the source causing the asset to be in exception. This will extend the life of the machine. We at Universal Technologies emphasize that the incremental time required to improve the machine is small compared to the costs of the unanticipated machine downtime and the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3. Problem Correction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, correcting the problem and improving the machine, it is important to verify that the correction or improvement has occurred. One mechanism for this verification is comparing before values to the original baseline data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other common verification methods include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased bearing life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased seal life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring reduced energy consumption&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring vibration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor current signature analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4. Correction Verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the simplest, but often neglected, forms of condition monitoring is visual inspection of machinery. While this is subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;gut feel&amp;rdquo; for where the problem is most severe. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective visual inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General cleanliness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on surrounding machine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on machine casing or bearing caps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on coupling guard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unusual marks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visible leaks (lubricants, cooling water, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lighting conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Local instrumentation for proper levels, temperatures, flows and amperage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fretting and wear particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Signs of overheating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper operation of slinger rings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Condensation/water in bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Differential temperatures, pressures and flows&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loose parts or components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machine guard or cover condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audible inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another simple form of condition monitoring is audible inspection of machinery. While this is also subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for the area where the source is originating. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner. The use of stethoscopes, sounding rods and other listening devices can enable an experienced practitioner to detect such problems as rubs, bearing defects, cavitation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When listening to a machine, try to determine if the sound is complex or simple, high frequency or low frequency, and from where the sound appears to be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective audible inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sounds that are out of the ordinary&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Humming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Squealing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Growling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rubbing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cavitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Arcing/popping sounds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hunting/beats&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Noise from leaks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Comparison noise from bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water hammer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lifting sentinels/relief valves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flow through system / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactile inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To hand-feel a machine for excessive vibration, perform the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Start at the bearings, feeling in vertical, horizontal and axial directions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work downward and outward from the machine, feeling the base, structures, pipes, pipe supports, valve stems, electrical boxes, electrical conduit, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Try to get a sense of the frequency of the vibration. For instance, is it high frequency, such as a buzz or a tingle? Or, is it low frequency, such as a shudder or a sway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10. Motor Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other tactile observations should be performed as well. Effective tactile inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on seal flush systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on cooler / heat exchanger inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on filters / strainers inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel oil for contaminants and metal particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel for flow through systems / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhancing visual inspections with spot radiometers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Infrared thermometers measure the amount of infrared energy emitted by a target object and calculate the temperature of that object&amp;rsquo;s surface. Typical features include laser sighting, adjustable emissivity, alarm functions and trigger locks. Other features may include data loggers and graphic displays, thermocouples, and software interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that the temperature reading is the outer surface temperature of the first surface the laser beam penetrates. If taking a reading through Plexiglas or other transparent material that the laser penetrates, the temperature reading will represent the Plexiglas surface only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11. Spot Radiometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; emissivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Emissivity is ability of a material to reflect heat. Different materials have different emissivity values and must be accounted for when attempting to obtain an absolute temperature reading. For comparison readings, emissivity is less of an issue provided that the two target materials are the same. If there is a need for accurate absolute temperature measurement, then the contact thermocouple provided should be used to cross-check the infrared data. Your instrument has functions that allow you to select the correct emissivity value for the target material, but for the intent of this article and general instrument use, the &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; setting will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; measurement spot size: &lt;/strong&gt;The measured spot size depends on the distance between the object you are measuring and the infrared thermometer. This will vary depending on manufacturer and by models from the same manufacturer. Note that the temperature is an average of the temperatures contained within the spot circle. Move closer to the target to get a smaller measurement area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strobe lights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Visual inspection of rotating assets in conjunction with using a strobe light allows other components to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coupling, shaft and key condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leak detection from bearing caps, mechanical seals and couplings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mechanical looseness of machine components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Belt condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Even tensioning / loading of belt drive systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Precautions and safety:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Performing visual, audible and tactile inspections can provide tremendous value when integrated into an overall reliability effort. Formalizing and documenting inspections that are being performed by non-PdM technicians will allow data to be utilized by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acceptance of integrating technologies to gain a better picture of equipment condition is widely accepted. Why not use this same model to leverage information from personnel who traditionally are not viewed as having an active role in reliability? Many times, operators and maintenance personnel can provide that &amp;ldquo;missing piece&amp;rdquo; of information that cannot be seen by the PdM technician when viewing equipment on a monthly or quarterly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many organizations would jump at the chance to add dozens of additional personnel to the reliability effort without adding additional cost? By training and engaging operators and maintenance personnel, that is exactly what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Azima DLI ensures reliability of Panama Canal locks using vibration monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on June 21 announced that its advanced vibration monitoring capabilities will be used by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) to achieve important equipment reliability and uptime goals associated with the operation of its lock system. The ACP is the autonomous agency of the Government of Panama in charge of managing, operating and maintaining the Panama Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Panama Canal is in constant operation, so uptime of critical equipment, such as the motors and hydraulic pumps used to ensure the locks operate as they are supposed to, is vitally important to the commercial and private vessels that rely on the Canal every day. Of the three locks, Miraflores was the first to select, through a public bid (provided through Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Central American distributor Termogram), the Azima DLI DCX, a rugged, four channel vibration data collector and real-time analyzer. Miraflores Locks&amp;rsquo; maintenance unit will use the Azima DLI vibration data collectors after training is complete. Termogram can provide the onsite training and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Panama Canal locks have long been recognized as significant engineering accomplishments. All lock chambers have the same 110 by 1,000 feet dimensions, and they are built in pairs. That means two lanes of chambers run side-by-side to accommodate two lanes of traffic, either in opposite directions at the same time or in the same direction, depending on transit needs. To make sure the locks are performing as needed, the ACP&amp;rsquo;s Miraflores Locks&amp;rsquo; maintenance unit will collect all its own data using the DCX to take vibration measurements on Miraflores&amp;rsquo; 200 motor pump groups (MPGs), which include gates, valves, locomotives and other motors throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our maintenance program includes thermography, remote visual inspection, oil analysis and vibration, which is an important component of measurement,&amp;rdquo; said Miraflores Locks maintenance manager Carlos Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Windows-compatible Azima DLI DCX allows vibration analysts to record, collect and analyze vibration information directly from a military-grade Tablet PC that features embedded ExpertALERT vibration analysis software. Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s ExpertAlert software allows analysts to have all their machinery history, analysis tools and automated diagnostic results at the point of data collection, supporting timely maintenance and repair decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the case of the Panama Canal, although MPGs are redundant in the lock machinery, failure avoidance is of utmost importance. If the MPG redundancy fails, the lock doors don&amp;rsquo;t open, causing delays with Canal traffic,&amp;rdquo; said Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Director of International Sales Ron Sullivan. &amp;ldquo;Due to the critical nature of its operations, the Panama Canal Authority is a leader in developing effective machine condition monitoring programs, maximizing the use of critical software to ensure its equipment is in peak condition. We are proud that Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX data collector and ExpertAlert diagnostic software will become important components of the maintenance team&amp;rsquo;s overall program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Azima DLI &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Azima DLI is the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services that align with customers&amp;rsquo; high standards for reliability, availability and uptime. Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s WATCHMAN Reliability Services utilize flexible deployment models, proven diagnostic software and unmatched analytical expertise to deliver sustainable, scalable and cost-effective condition-based maintenance programs.

            <title>NV Energy installs wireless solution to increase plant reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	No matter where an asset sits in the plant, the need to understand its health has become increasingly vital. While most facilities continuously monitor their critical machinery, their less-critical assets &amp;ndash; often called &amp;ldquo;essential assets&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; cannot typically justify the expense of a traditional continuous monitoring system due to the installation costs of running wires and installing sensors. As such, these assets tend to be addressed with portable data collection programs where operators make rounds at monthly or quarterly intervals, manually collecting data. However, these data collection intervals are rarely satisfactory for essential assets, and problems can progress from &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; from one data collection interval to the next. Or, in some cases, manual data collection is simply not practical or possible due to the nature of the asset &amp;ndash; jeopardizing the safety of the employee tasked with collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To address such challenges and elevate plant reliability, industrial facilities are increasingly turning to wireless. NV Energy highlights this trend with its recent installation of GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Bently Nevada Essential Insight.mesh wireless condition monitoring system. The system was installed at the company&amp;rsquo;s Fort Churchill Operating Station in Yerington, Nev., with the goal of reducing operating expenses and increasing reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before the installation of Essential Insight.mesh, these assets were only infrequently monitored by a walk-around program. The wireless condition monitoring systems help to improve overall plant reliability and efficiency by extending condition monitoring to a broader array of essential assets that were previously underserved and classified as mid- to low-criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We were excited to be the first plant in NV Energy to utilize this new technology,&amp;rdquo; says Greg Bushman, plant manager at Fort Churchill. &amp;ldquo;We have always used Bently Nevada condition monitoring for our critical assets, so it seemed like a natural fit to extend this to our essential assets, as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the course of two days, the entire wireless system was deployed and configured on a wide range of rotating machines, including boiler feed pumps, condensate pumps, AC lube oil pumps, service water pumps, circulation water pumps and an FD fan. The system consisted of 21 vibration sensors, seven wSIM nodes, three Repeaters and System 1 software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system began returning useful information almost immediately as anomalies were detected on cooling water pumps and confirmed the need to plan and schedule repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because the data from these assets is transmitted wirelessly to the plant&amp;rsquo;s Electronics Room, where a System 1 display computer is located, it is now within easy reach of plant operators and is integrated with all of the data from other monitored assets, such as the plant&amp;rsquo;s critical turbine-generator sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This provides operators with plant-wide analysis and insight capabilities on the mechanical condition of their assets, allowing data-driven decisions and thus reducing costs of plant operations and maintenance. Armed with these benefits, and the considerably lower costs of installation and deployment that wireless technology affords, customers can more confidently and easily justify expansion of online condition monitoring to a broader spectrum of assets in their plants, such as remote deep-well pumps, cooling towers and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By helping plants extend affordable, online monitoring to more asset types, they can operate smarter &amp;ndash; increasing efficiency, reliability, and uptime, which can translate to a reduction in operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Oil and fuel quality monitoring on power gen equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There exists a critical need in the mobile and fixed asset market to empower field units to determine oil quality on demand and provide complementary oil condition information that has been traditionally obtained from oil analysis labs. The current methodology of testing in off-site labs is non-optimal and costly due to the logistical challenges of shipping samples and the time delay in getting information back to personnel to be able to make quick and informed decisions. Determining oil quality in real time with embedded and portable oil assessment devices operated by mechanic personnel provides the operational flexibility and rapid means of screening oil quality that is key to establishing a program to provide real-time condition-based monitoring products for the care of all assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring the viscosity of oil is a rapid method of determining oil condition, and is considered an important parameter in assessing asset readiness. The SenGenuity ViSmart viscosity sensor, which can compliment IR spectroscopy and other bulk property sensors, can provide instantaneous on-line viscosity and temperature data, has no moving parts with an extremely wide operating range and offers universal plug-and-play connectivity for integration with and into other handheld products. The sensors have been on the market for close to a decade and are currently installed in markets ranging from oil condition monitoring in machine tool and rotating equipment industries to process control in coating applications. It is in these rigorous environments where ROI benefits have been realized, and are now been evaluated for mobile and fixed assets where oil condition monitoring is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SenGenuity&amp;rsquo;s acoustic wave (AW) sensors offer a number of advantages over conventional mechanical and electromechanical viscometers as they are small solid-state devices that can be completely immersed in the oil providing an instantaneous viscosity data stream for embedded OEM or end-user spot-check applications. The sensors are unaffected by shock or vibration or by flow conditions, so they can be used in harsh operating conditions to measure viscosity from zero to 500 cP with a temperature range of minus-15 degrees to 125 degrees Celsius with a high degree of accuracy. At the same time, sensor measurements are not affected by particulates in the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conventional mechanical and electro-mechanical viscometers designed primarily for laboratory measurements are difficult to integrate into the control and monitoring environment. As a consequence, many companies rely on decisions based on intermittent &amp;ldquo;snapshot&amp;rdquo; data acquired from periodic sampling where conventional instrumentation can be affected by temperature, shear rate and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given that contaminants in oil (water, solvents and fuel) are known to degrade viscosity and cause damage to internal components of diesel assets, whether they are trucks or construction equipment or military vehicles or power gen equipment, it is important to not just rely on snapshot data. High water contamination levels in diesel fuel have been shown to be the reason for corrosion and pitting, leading to increased metal wear particle counts. The presence of residual cleaning solvents and fuel contamination has caused seals to swell and create less-than-ideal engine operating situations. Knowledge of viscosity in real time provide a significant benefit to measure aging of oil, ingress of contaminants during commercial operations and prevent incipient mechanical failure due to loss of oil lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This case study, together with customer data, shows the SenGenuity ViSmart viscosity threaded bolt sensor (Figure 2) that is targeted at embedded integration to fi xed and mobile diesel assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SenGenuity has developed a unique method to offer a viscosity sensor with a wide dynamic range (air to several thousand cP) in a single sensor (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/sengen101.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. The SenGenuity sensor uses an acoustic waveguide with electrical transducers on one surface and being in contact with the fluid on the other surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ViSmart is a commercially available, robust, reliable and cost-effective surface acoustic wave solid-state viscometer for integration into in-line, real-time monitoring and process control systems for scalable applications (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/sengen102.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. SenGenuity Solid-state Low-shear Bolt Viscosity Sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sensor has no moving parts (other than the atomic scale vibration of the surface) and, due to the high frequency of the vibration, several millions of vibrations per second, is independent of flow conditions of the liquid and immune to vibration effects of the environment. High-temperature electronics are utilized that allow a very wide operating temperature range for the sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of these acoustic sensors lies in the distinctly different measurement principle. Whereas one class of mechanical devices measures kinematic (flow) viscosity and the other class measures intrinsic (friction) viscosity, the acoustic wave (AW) sensors measure acoustic impedance, (&amp;omega;&amp;rho;&amp;eta;)1/2, where &amp;omega; is the radian frequency (2&amp;pi;F), &amp;rho; is the density and &amp;eta; is the intrinsic viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The viscosity measurement is made by placing the quartz crystal wave resonator in contact with liquid. The liquid&amp;rsquo;s viscosity determines the thickness of the fluid hydro-dynamically coupled to the surface of the sensor. The sensor surface is in uniform motion at frequency, &amp;omega;=2&amp;pi;F, with amplitude, U. The frequency is known by design and amplitude is determined by the power level of the electrical signal applied to the sensor. As the shear wave penetrates into the adjacent fl uid to a depth, d, determined by the frequency, viscosity and density of the liquid as d=(2&amp;eta;/&amp;omega;&amp;rho;)1/2, as depicted in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/sengen103.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. This figure depicts a cross-section of the sensor showing transducers on the lower surface and liquid molecules (gold balls) on the upper surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Acoustic viscosity is calculated using power loss from the quartz resonator into the fluid. The unit of measure is acoustic viscosity (AV) and is equal to &amp;rho;&amp;eta;, (g/cm3 &amp;bull; cP) (density times dynamic viscosity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic wave resonator supports a standing wave through its thickness. The wave pattern interacts with electrodes on the lower surface (hermetically sealed from the liquid) and interacts with the fluid on the upper surface. The bulk of the liquid is unaffected by the acoustic signal and a thin layer (on the order of microns or micro inches) is moved by the vibrating surface. Also present is a proprietary hard coat surface that is scratch proof and abrasion resistant which allows the sensor to be operable in extreme environments and enabling the ViSmart sensor to be a suitable candidate for oil condition- and fuel quality-based monitoring applications in mobile and fixed asset markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Application and Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A customer in a third-world country in the telecom and data enterprise industry has strategic and critical power generation equipment in far-flung locations. Challenges of logistics are such that they would rather not have to conduct frequent site visits. Due to the remoteness of the sites, they are not part of power or telecommunications grid, and as such are susceptible to weather damage, equipment malfunction, vandalism and asset theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partnering with remote site monitoring solution providers, the ViSmart sensors, as part of an overall solution package, can provide secure and reliable monitoring for the quality of the oil and fuel present in the power generator sets that present in these telecom and data enterprise infrastructures.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The goal of the customer was two-fold. First, they wanted to be able to identify if the quality of oil was within the nominal operating performance parameters over time and to determine if oil change intervals could be improved (currently oil is changed every 150 to 200 hours). Viscosity reading was identified as the key indicator parameter (it is important to note that the ViSmart sensor also measures temperature). A secondary goal was to ensure that the sensor would identify an event wherein a non-specified oil was introduced to the power-gen set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, the customer had a requirement of identifying if there was contamination in the fuel line, either due to the water or kerosene. Again, viscosity reading was identified as a key indicator parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Test conditions were set up and actual oil samples were obtained from a power-gen set supplying continuous electrical power (at variable load) in lieu of commercially purchase power (output rating of 22 kVA, 18 kW at 220V/60 Hz). In Figure 4, the relationship between viscosity of virgin and used 15W40 oil as a function of temperature is observed. The used oil has a run time of 150 hours; it is clearly observed that the shift in viscosity in nominal and there is no need to change the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Viscosity-temperature Data for New and Used 15W40&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the same set-up, different grades of oil were checked for viscosity values in order to confirm the ability of the ViSmart sensor to differentiate between types of oil. Furthermore, the different types of oil were introduced to the power-gen set equipment specified 15W40 to determine if the sensor can notify the customer of an event when incorrect oil is present. The data is shown in Figure 5, acquired at a temperature of 40 degrees C, and clearly shows the differentiation in the condition of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5b. Different Viscosity Values for Various Oil Condition States at 40 Degrees Celsius (in detail)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Viscosity data also was acquired at 100 degrees C; and again, the differentiation in the different oil condition states is observed (see Figure 6). With viscosity data acquired at multiple temperatures, determining the condition of the oil and verifying if it is within its operational parameters is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/sengen107.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Different Viscosity Values for Various Oil Condition States at 100 Degrees Celsius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the same set-up in the power-gen equipment, viscosity of diesel fuel, combined with contamination in the fuel was measured at various temperatures. The contamination consisted of water and kerosene, and all conditions were measured at 25 degrees and 40 degrees Celsius. As the data in Figure 7 clearly shows, the ViSmart is capable of monitoring the fuel viscosity and ensuring that it is within performance parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/sengen108.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7. Different Viscosity Values for Various Fuel Quality States at 25 and 40 Degrees Celsius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the data above indicates that with simple logic employed at the remote monitoring station, together with warning and alarm conditions, the viscosity and temperature of oil and fuel acquired can monitor the proper conditions needed for the power-gen equipment to function reliably without downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ViSmart viscosity sensor can be readily applied in field operations or installed directly on the equipment for continuous monitoring of viscosity to enable the mechanic personnel to test the oil or fuel in minutes. It would be complementary to lab oil analysis test burden by providing real-time viscosity data and would enable streamlining of logistic costs. And given no calibration is required for the rugged vibration and shock proof sensor, once it is installed in a harsh industrial environments, maintenance costs are extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sensors are currently used in 24/7 applications in the commercial sector, with real-time data transfer for decision making abilities. The real-time in-line threaded bolt sensor can be fully immersed in the oil and/or fuel and be simply used for spot-checking or continuous monitoring. Providing real-time viscosity data and using the sensor continuously would provide the necessary information to personnel to make critical decisions in actual field applications leading to extension of machine life and maintenance schedules while complimenting the other oil quality parameter data stream obtained from the labs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Download the new SDT ultrasound App for iPhone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the more perplexing things for new (and old) ultrasound inspectors is what conclusions to draw from their data and trends. The new i-Phone app from SDT North America is designed to make sense of ultrasound trends and baseline increases. For instance, if your baseline is 20dB&amp;micro;V and today&amp;#39;s reading is 26dB&amp;micro;V and you want to know what the 6dB&amp;micro;V increase represents, tap it on your iPhone and you&amp;#39;ll know the increase is a factor of 2X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Detect machine problems early: Best practices for operators</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When working around equipment for a long time, it is easy to become accustomed to it working as it should. It can make us numb to potential problems, especially if they come on gradually. This article will present some techniques that will allow you to detect problems early, and hopefully eliminate downtime and/or reduce maintenance costs. Further, it will give insight into what is in common driven equipment and their drivers. How a centrifugal and positive displacement pump works will be explained in the simplest of terms. Some important relationships of flow, heat and horsepower are highlighted so troubleshooting can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This article will outline lubrication systems, bearings, drivers, and both centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. The one secret to detecting problems early is to know what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; is. The operator is one of the few people who knows how a piece of equipment is supposed to sound, what the pressure normally produced is, and what the equipment feels like when it is doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Types of lubrication systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Splash &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; This type of lubrication system is one that usually consists of a reservoir of oil and some part of the spinning shaft and attachment, or the rolling elements of the bearing, that touch the oil and cause it to splash to allow lubrication to take place. There is a place to check the oil level, and it is most important for operators to ensure there is oil.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ring&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This lubrication is accomplished by use of a large ring, usually brass, riding on the turning shaft. It dips down into the oil reservoir and, by viscous drag, brings oil up onto the shaft where it is distributed along the shaft to the bearing. As above, there is a place to check the oil level and it is most important for operators to ensure that oil is present. There also is usually a place to look at the ring while the piece of equipment is running. This should be viewed often to ensure the ring is turning; if the ring stops, the lubrication also will stop.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Circulating &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; In this type of lubricating system, there is usually a reservoir, a pump, a filter, and it may or may not have a heat exchanger. It supplies oil to the lubricated item at very low or essentially no pressure. It is used when a control flow of clean lubricant is necessary to one or more places that may not be at the same level as the reservoir. It is very similar to a forced-feed lubrication system but uses its pump to circulate oil only. Check the level in the reservoir and the color of the lubricant. If there are changes, the question &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; should always come to mind. If there is a heat exchanger, it should be clean. In Figure 1, the circulating system heat exchanger should be cleaned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Forced&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This system is very similar to the circulating system, but it does operate at a system pressure. It usually has a pressure regulating valve to maintain pressure on the system, and it has coolers, multiple pumps, a pressure regulator, auto start of the standby pump, filters and a reservoir. This system is required to remain at pressure or the equipment to which it is supplying lubrication will fail. There are usually safety switches that will cause the lubricated piece of equipment to shut down if the level in the tank falls below a set amount, or if the pressure in the system becomes too low. In addition to the checks of the circulating system, additional checks should be made, such as: &amp;ldquo;Are both the main and auxiliary oil pumps running?&amp;rdquo; If so, why? What is the system pressure? Is it normal? Touch the discharge side of the relief valve on the discharge of the pump. Is it relieving? It should not be. See Figure 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Oil mist&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a system that consists of a tank, tubing and piping to each item being lubricated, an atomizer, and various safety devices relating to flow and level in the reservoir. With this system, there may or may not be a level in the lubricated piece of equipment. There are two general types of mist systems. One is pure mist where there is no lubricant reservoir in each piece of equipment. The other type is a purge mist system where there is a level in the lubricated piece of equipment and oil mist fills the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; space above the reservoir to control that atmosphere. See Figure 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Automatic grease lubricators&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; These are often used to grease inaccessible places. They have a timing mechanism that can be electronic, chemical or mechanical. They may or may not put out much pressure, so they can be prevented from delivering lubricant in some instances. It is important for these lubricators to be marked on their reservoirs with a permanent marker line with the lubricant level and a date as to when the lubricant was at that level. It is one of the few ways to know that lubricant is being put to what is being lubricated. The operator then has a visual reference as to if lubricant is being provided. If the lubricant is being delivered slowly, it should be remarked every few months with a new line and dated to ensure lubricant is being delivered. See Figure 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication is one of the most important aspects of rotating equipment. It is also the neglect of lubrication that causes many pieces of equipment to fail. Lubrication performs the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Entirely separates moving surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removes heat generated within the bearing and/or from an outside source&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Protects metals from corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flushes away contaminants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dampens noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 5 illustrates the difference between full fluid film lubrication with complete separation of surfaces and boundary layer lubrication. Boundary layer lubrication is where there is oil present but not sufficient to keep all surfaces separated, and some wear does take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From an inspection view, it is important to notice the following properties of the lubricant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				It is important to notice changes in the lubricant, smell, color and level.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the reservoir is small and an oil leak is detected, check the level immediately as not much leakage can be tolerated before the level is dangerously low.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the color has changed significantly from yesterday, or what you know to be normal, find out why.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Ensure that levels are maintained. This problem will cause equipment to fail catastrophically in a relatively short period of time if not corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the level is increasing, find out why; water may be entering the system. A simple test is to drain some of the lubricant out onto a napkin or paper towel. The oil will be absorbed into towel but the water beads will stand on the oil soaked towel.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bearings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Plain:&lt;/strong&gt; These are a general category of simple bearings. They can also be called sleeved bearings and, in its simplest form, bushings. They consist of a bearing material that is stationary usually and a rotating shaft. They may be lubricated by any of the above methods of lubrication and are a very common bearing, especially in large, heavy, rotored machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One type of plain bearing is called the pillow block bearing. Many of these have water connections going into them for cooling. It normally consists of a water in and water out line on the same side of the bearing and a loop or &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo; on the other side. Many times, these are rubber hoses and after years exposed to the outside elements they can dry and crack, allowing a leak which reduces the cooling water to the bearing. Where these connections enter, the pillow block bearing can become poorly sealed, allowing the elements to enter the bearing oil; or if the hose is leaking, the leakage can enter the bearing oil and result in a bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Rolling element:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a large group of bearings including roller, tapered roller, ball and needle. They can be lubricated by either grease or oil depending on the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. If a frictionless type of bearing is known to be hot, do not put a water hose on it. The water could get into the lubricant and the cooling water on the outer housing will shrink. The result will likely be the elimination of internal clearances and may cause the bearing to seize immediately. Figure 6 lists numerous bearing types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Motors: &lt;/strong&gt;This is likely the most common type of driver for not only pumps but many other types of equipment found in industry. They consist of two major components. The rotating element inside the motor is called the rotor, and the stationary housing is called the stator. The stator has the electrical wiring in it, and most industry uses three-phase power. From an operations point of view, the three-phase power means that if any two leads are moved to a new mounting location externally at the connection to the power source, the direction of the motor will be reversed. This is really important because many types of equipment must turn in one direction. That is why the direction of rotation is checked before the coupling is installed between the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		As a general rule, if you touch a motor and it is too hot to keep your hand on, it is likely that it is running too hot. The fins on the outside of a motor are to aid with cooling. These should be clean and clear of debris and insulation. A rule of thumb is that motors that run hotter will likely have a shorter life than one running cooler. There are many factors in determining &amp;ldquo;too&amp;rdquo; hot, such as the class of insulation and load on the motor at a given time. The best analysis is done by knowing what is normal and detecting a significant change. When the change is noted, get additional information as to the significance of the change; that would include help from an acknowledged professional as to insulation type and acceptable upper limit of operation. The motor will not fail immediately as the higher temperatures are reached, but running at the higher temperatures is cumulative. It will eventually cause the motor life to be shortened. If you have large motors with an enclosure for outdoors, ensure that the screens or filters that are supposed to be kept clean stay clean. If not, the temperatures will go up and the motor life can be significantly reduced. Figure 7 is a totally enclosed fan-cooled motor (TEFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Steam Turbines:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam turbines are another common driver for industrial equipment. They act like a child&amp;rsquo;s pinwheel in the wind. The turbine may have multiple &amp;ldquo;pinwheels&amp;rdquo;, or stages, and the wind is normally replaced by steam. The shafts are sealed by some means of trying to keep the steam from leaking out to the atmosphere. This is done to save the heated and treated water and to keep the steam from going where you do not want it. If the steam seals are leaking badly, it is not uncommon for the steam to enter the bearing housings and condense. The water will return with the oil to the reservoir. And since the oil pumps draw near the bottom of the tank eventually if allowed to continue, the oil pumps will be circulating water or a mixture of water and oil, which are not good lubricants. If visible steam is seen leaking out, the reservoir should be checked to insure that large quantities of water are not accumulating in the reservoir. Just remember that when visible steam is being seen, check lubricant reservoirs to ensure the water is not displacing the lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If there is cooling water being supplied to the bearing area, touch the inlet and outlet water lines to ensure heat exchange is taking place or at least flow is taking place. Watch for oil leaks as the oil may collect in the insulation and come in contact with the hot piping or casing and a fire will result.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Notice if the turbine seems to vibrate more with it rains that when the day is sunny. The insulation may allow water to enter and cool the casing in an uneven manner, affecting alignment and how smoothly the turbine runs. No one but operators will likely notice the set of cause and affects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Gearboxes:&lt;/strong&gt; These are often used when there is a large difference between the speed of the driver and the driven piece of equipment. From an operator or casual point of view, the items that are most notable when passing are the sound the gear is making and the temperature and vibration of the gearbox to the touch. This needs to be compared to what it has been. Remember, we are looking for changes from what is or accepted as normal. Always check foundation bolts by looking for oil being squeezed in and out between the base plate and the foot of the gearbox. Look at the shims as well. Do they look like they have been squirming out? This is a potential sign of looseness or high vibration at some time. Figure 9 is an example of a parallel shaft gearbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Heat exchangers: &lt;/strong&gt;A heat exchanger is a device built for efficient heat transfer from one medium to another, whether the media are separated by a solid wall so that they never mix, or the media are in direct contact. One of the most common types of heat exchangers in the oil and petrochemical industry is the shell and tube. A severely fowled tube is shown in figure below. The fowling will reduce flow and affect the ability of the exchanger to exchange heat. Figure 10 is an example of a shell and tube heat exchanger and Figure 11 is a badly fowled exchanger tube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Driven: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Only centrifugal and positive displacement pumps will be discussed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Centrifugal pump &lt;/strong&gt;(Figure 12 is a generic centrifugal pump): These are one of the most common types of pumps in industry. They can be of the open or closed impeller type, and may be single or multiple stages. They use the principal of increasing the velocity of the fluid being pumped and Bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle to develop pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps consist of a shaft with bearings for support and an impeller as well as a pump casing and a method of sealing the spinning shaft to keep the liquid being pumped from getting into the atmosphere. The pump has the relationships as listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember in centrifugal pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pressure is increasing on the discharge pressure gauge, the flow is likely decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, then the horsepower required is increasing. That can be shown by increasing amps or kilowatts.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity is increasing, the discharge pressure will fall and the horsepower required to pump the fluid will increase.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR will also increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Typical pump curve&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 13)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Positive displacement pumps&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 14)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		A positive displacement pump is one that, as it turns, liquid is ejected from the pump. As the pump is turned faster, more liquid is ejected from the pump. In this pump, flow on the discharge side of the pump must never be stopped as something will be damaged. There are many types of positive displacement pumps, but no matter how the pump is configured inside, the results are the same. As the pump turns, the liquid must have a place to go.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps have pump curves as do the centrifugal pumps and show much of the same information, but they look differently. Figure 15 is a typical positive displacement pump curve.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember for positive displacement pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the discharge pressure is rising, the horsepower required to pump is also rising.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pump is required to put out more gallons per minute, then the speed of the pump must be increased.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity of the fluid is increasing, then the horsepower required to pump it is also increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR also must increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques available to operators and field people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These inspections are done during rounds. Listen to the equipment and notice differences over time. In motors, a loud hum may mean an internal motor problem or potentially a soft foot condition. If it was quiet yesterday and noisy today, what happened to cause the change? Squealing belts can indicate an overload condition or just loose belts. A scraping sound or rhythmic sound can indicate a dragging or rubbing. A broken tooth on a gearbox may be detected by a clicking or regularly reoccurring sound from inside the gearbox. If a ringing sound is heard, it is important to find the source and ensure that it is not something that will cause a problem with the piece of equipment. Sometimes putting a listening device on a piece of equipment can help identify the source of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Bad or poorly lubricated bearing can be heard using the auditable techniques listed. This is especially useful on frictionless types of bearings. Rubs and other noise-producing maladies can be detected in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Look for leaks; look at fluid levels, burned paint, vibrating shafts or housings. Paint burns at about 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 230 degrees Celsius); and if that is near lubricating oil, then it is likely that the oil has gotten that hot as well. That could mean the condition of the oil is no longer viable as a lubricant. Look at motor fan guards for blockage and the fins on TEFC motors to ensure cooling can take place.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Ensure that pressure gauges are installed and working. The most accurate readings are when the pressure of interest is between the 10 and 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock position on the gauge. It is most important to know what the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; pressure is for any piece of operating equipment. Look for signs of over-lubrication. This condition will not only make a mess, but will shorten equipment life. It is also a potential environmental problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If equipment is ring oiled, it is generally easy to look at the ring while the equipment is running. This is a good check because if the ring stops turning for any reason, it has the same affect as the oil pump stopping in a forced lubrication system. There will be no lubrication for the bearings. (Figure 16)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 16 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		After making sure you will not be burned, touch the equipment. Notice if it feels like tingling in your fingers; that would indicate a high-frequency or fast-occurring vibration. Is it hot? Is it hotter than the last time you touched it? Is the hot spot localized or generally hot all over? The temperature on the outside of bearing housings is generally less than the temperature of the bearing itself. The actual temperature of the bearing will be about 30 to 50 degrees F (2 to 10 C) higher than the outside temperature. If a seal pot is used, touch the two lines going to the seal gland. If circulation is taking place, one should be hotter than the other&amp;nbsp;; it is a way to know that circulation is taking place. If a pump has multiple filters on it, touching the outlet of the pump and then each filter down stream, it is possible to determine which one is in service. If a pressure relief valve is leaking through, it can be detected by touching the discharge side of the relief valve and the inlet to the relief valve. There should be a difference in the temperatures of the two lines if there is not leakage. If the temperatures are the same, it is likely that the relief valve is leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Lightly touching a piece of equipment with fingertips can give a subjective evaluation of how smooth a piece of equipment is running. With practice, it is a reasonably good method of detecting vibration. It must be done regularly as that is the only way to note the changes from yesterday or last week.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		If belts were loose, it may be possible to detect it not only by the sound but also by the smell of the rubber being removed from the side of the belts. Burned oil has a distinct scent that can indicate a potential problem. Paint that gets hot enough to discolor gives a distinctive odor. Each scent may indicate a particular problem with the equipment. Other problems can be indicated if the product being processed in the plant gives a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; odor and when there is a problem it gives a distinctly different odor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The advantages of these types of inspections are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Always available&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Inexpensive&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Can be done by anyone&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The disadvantages to these techniques are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Subjective&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to communicate to work request or someone else&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to repeat&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Problems cannot be detected at their earliest stages of inception&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tools available to improve detection or quantify what your senses detect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasonic gun: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a relatively inexpensive device for listening to noises in the ultrasonic range. It is sometimes used in leak detection and sometimes when listening to bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Stethoscope:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an inexpensive tool that can pick up every sound that the equipment is making. It must be used regularly or it is impossible to determine if there is a problem or not. The good news is that it picks up everything, and the bad news is that it picks up everything.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Screwdriver: &lt;/strong&gt;A steel or aluminum rod can be used to touch the piece of equipment where the suspected noise is and the other end touched to the ear to listen for unusual noises. The end touching the ear should be padded and the other end kept away from rotating shafts.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Valve wrench:&lt;/strong&gt; A valve wrench can be used in the same way as the other techniques to get the sound of what is happening inside a piece of rotating equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Hard hat:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a hard hat can be turned on edge and touched to the equipment and the other end touched to the ear to listen for potential problems inside the rotating piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR gun:&lt;/strong&gt; The infrared handheld non-contact temperature-measuring device is an easy tool use if it is used within its limitations. The limitations are: Many IR guns use a laser pointer to tell where you are aiming the device. The area the device looks at is cone-shaped and the laser is at the center of the cone (Figure 17). That means the further away from the item of interest you are, the more surface area will be averaged into the reading. The laser spot does not represent the measurement area of the device. The first surface that the device sees is the one that will be measured. You can&amp;rsquo;t measure the temperature of something behind a glass or plastic cover, as that cover will be what is measured. If correct temperatures are important, the device must be used on flat, dark-colored objects. It will give very low readings on shiny objects. The best use of the device is to mark a black paint spot on the areas of interest and use the infrared gun, as close as possible at that spot. It is the only way to get useful repeatable readings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR camera: &lt;/strong&gt;These devices are similar to the handheld guns, but are like looking through a camera. The objects look gray, with a color scale range showing different temperatures. What appears to have no problem with the naked eye will show very differently with the infrared camera. Typical pictures of what the eye can see and what the infrared camera can see are illustrated in figure 18.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Strobe light&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 19): This device has a high-intensity light that can be controlled to a specific flash rate. When an object is turning at a specific speed and the strobe flash rate is tuned to the same flash rate, the moving object appears to be stopped. A good visual inspection can be done while a piece of equipment is turning at running speed. Things like broken shim packs in couplings, missing keys or broken fans on electric motors can all be inspected without having to stop the piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Vibration equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A handheld vibration meter can be used to get overall readings. The use of equipment to augment the five senses is useful because it is objective and not subjective. Everyone that uses the equipment and measures in the same place will get the same number. If 50 people touch the same piece of equipment in the same place, there is likely to be 50 different interpretations of how much vibration there is. This is also true for how hot a piece of equipment is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If quantitative analysis is required, a contact parameter is an inexpensive and accurate tool for temperatures. It is simple to use and will give repeatable results no matter what color the surface being measured is.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GUIDES FOR OPERATORS TO INSPECT EQUIPMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These types of inspections can be generated for all types of equipment, such as fans, compressors, extruders, turbines, motors, conveyers, elevators, etc. This list is limited to centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, gearboxes, motors, heat exchanger and turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;PUMP INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le-Bleu_oil.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the pump as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Smoking?&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the pump that have come loose?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the motor amps. Pump capacity problems do not cause the motor to pull excessive amps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the seal leaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there proper level in the seal pot if used?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the discharge pressure gauge steady? (If not, there may be cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is paint burned off in new places? Why? (Paint discolors around 400 to 450 degrees F / 200 to 230 degrees C)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at vibration levels on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the pump.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Bearings? Cavitation?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday? Is the noise the motor or the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing? (It may be a control valve opening and closing.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound like gravel inside of the pump casing? (Cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If used, are the drive belts squealing? Are belts loose?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the pump with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it warm, hot, cold?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it shaking too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary oil pump running if it has one? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil relief valve dumping oil? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the pump vibrating? Is it the same as yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the bearing housing hot? (It may be too much oil or bad cooler.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch the seal lines; is there a difference in temperature indicating flow?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;MOTOR INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; (mechanical)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the motor as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it smoking or sparks flying?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there anything loose, shaking or vibrating on the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the flex conduit in good condition or broken?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Has the dust cap come off of the bearing on the coupling end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan on the TEFC motor turning?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the air filters or fins on a TEFC motor clear so air can circulate?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there any paint burned on the motor? If yes, why and where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Bearings? Fan?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise the motor or the driven piece of equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or a rhythmic hum?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the belts slipping on the drive end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Touch the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it vibrating?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan turning and putting out air?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the cooling system for the motor and/or lubrication system functioning correctly?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GEARBOX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the gearbox as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Smoking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the gearbox that have come loose? (Coolers, bearing caps, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary pump running? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;

			Is the delta P for the oil filter high? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check the vibration readings if continuously monitored.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the gearbox.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the gearbox?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is an oil cooler, is heat being exchanged? Touch the inlet and outlines to insure heat is being removed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;TURBINE INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the turbine as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it smoking? There may be an oil leak and fire potential&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the turbine that have come loose? (Coolers, bearing caps, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is steam leaking out of the glands that seal the shaft to the casing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the governor hunting (a continuous speeding up and slowing down in speed)?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the steam traps near the turbine working?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary pump running? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil cool enough? Is the cooler working?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the vibration readings for the turbine; are they steady and low? If not, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil level correct in the sump? In the bearing boxes?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the ring oilers turning or hung up?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there steam leaking out of the stem of the control valve?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the air purge turned on for the bearings to keep steam out of the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there coupling pieces on the pedestal under the coupling guard?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the trip mechanism resting on its knife edge?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the delta P for the oil filter high? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check the vibration readings if continuously monitored.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at piping support springs to ensure that blocks were not left in after maintenance, especially if a hydro was performed on the piping system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the coupling area and see if there are shims from the spacer or dust if an elastometric type of coupling is used.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Is steam leaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing? Is the governor steady or hunting?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the turbine?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the turbine bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check oil cooler to ensure it is removing heat from the oil.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;HEAT EXCHANGER INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the heat exchanger as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the differential pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is heat being exchanged in the cooler? Touch the inlet and outlet and insure there is a difference in temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the delta T for the exchanger normal?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the exchanger&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there the sound of gas or boiling going on inside?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the exchanger your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch or test the inlets and outlets of the exchanger to see if an exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment start-up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check and start all auxiliary system. That would include lubrication, seal, and cooling systems as they apply.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure there are adequate liquid levels in all areas that have liquids&amp;nbsp;; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers and barrier or buffer systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated prior to starting.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for warm up to allow all parts to come to temperature. A rule of thumb is to allow the pump temperature to rise at 100 degrees per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the pump uses a double seal or other arrangement that has a cooler, ensure that the cooler is functioning by touching the inlet and outlet parts to ensure that heat exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is a device such as a guided slide or flex plate as on steam turbines, it must be free to allow movement or flexing as temperatures rise from ambient. The same is true for extreme cold temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			On motors, ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that the area around the equipment is clean and free of hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Ensure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that all valves are in the proper position.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Start the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform operational checks after startup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment shutdown:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for cool down to allow all parts to come to temperature and oil left circulating long enough to ensure the bearings will not be damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant prior to shutdown while it is still circulating. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that there are adequate lubricant levels in all areas that have lubricant; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the auxiliary systems, again to include lubrication, seal systems and cooling. If rotors are extremely hot (above 250 F / 120 C), allow the lubricating system to circulate to cool the shaft and bearings. This is especially necessary if the bearings are made of babbited material.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the equipment has a cooler to regulate temperatures, it is ideal to have a method of back-flushing the cooler. This should be done at each opportunity such as shutdown or equipment swaps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow. If they are obstructed, see that they are cleared before the next use. If the motor has filters, look at the condition of the filters and have them changed if they are dirty before the next start.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Insure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform a visual inspection for leaks after shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		While appearing elemental, the list of inspection items, explanation of equipment, and important relationships is essential to good equipment operation and longevity. It is not unusual for people to accomplish these tasks away from work but are not always practiced at work as an operator. The simple techniques of touching, listening and visually inspecting equipment while on rounds or passing by equipment will ensure the best life possible for equipment and reduce the likelihood of unexpected failures.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

            <title>SDG&amp;E improves operations and safety, extends asset life</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management&amp;rsquo;s Smart Wireless technology is helping San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&amp;amp;E) increase throughput, extend asset life, and improve process efficiency and safety at its Palomar Energy Center in Escondido, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five applications of Emerson&amp;rsquo;s WirelessHART network use Rosemount wireless transmitters communicating with a single Smart Wireless Gateway to collect new, continuous data for SDG&amp;amp;E. The wireless network is integrated with Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Ovation expert system in the plant. The data from the wireless network is integrated into Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Ovation expert control system which monitors and controls critical plant processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Emerson Smart Wireless is very easy, very reliable,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Lyons, SDG&amp;amp;E instrument technician. &amp;ldquo;We used wireless for the ease of installation; we did not have to run any power or instrument wiring and that was a great cost savings benefit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved efficiencies and asset protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;SDG&amp;amp;E has increased its cooling tower throughput with the help of real-time cooling riser data delivered by Rosemount wireless temperature transmitters. The reliable technology helps it tap process data that was previously uncollected and use it for efficiency calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Now we can use the efficiency calculation to confirm that cooling fans are running at correct speeds,&amp;rdquo; said Lyons. &amp;ldquo;With this confirmation, we do not have to over-compensate, which gives the plant better thermal efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a second application, turbine compartment temperatures are checked continuously by wireless temperature transmitters to detect leaks of turbine exhaust cooling air. Previously, SDG&amp;amp;E had only switches that would close if the temperature reached a certain point, but had no temperature data to indicate leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The new data allows us to perform maintenance when needed, and less on a scheduled basis. As a result we have cut our preventive maintenance on the turbines in half,&amp;rdquo; Lyons said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A third Smart Wireless application of Rosemount wireless pressure transmitters detects air leaks from two forced draft fans as each alternately sits idle while the other runs to cool turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Wireless pressure data has helped us find leaks in a more expeditious manner,&amp;rdquo; Lyons said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re able to lower the fans&amp;rsquo; amps, which has lengthened their lifetime. Every five years, we will save approximately one fan motor, which costs $15,000 to $20,000.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a fourth application, Rosemount wireless DP transmitters check inlet air filters that protect turbine blades in an area subjected to construction dust. When filters are fouled, turbine efficiency is severely reduced. SDG&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s filter cleaning system did not provide accurate filter condition readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;After installing wireless DP, we have improved turbine efficiency and reduced our megawatt usage,&amp;rdquo; Lyons said. &amp;ldquo;With better DP information across the filters we can clean them at the proper time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personnel safety improved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In a fifth Smart Wireless application, SDG&amp;amp;E installed a Rosemount wireless temperature transmitter to monitor pipes on the facility&amp;rsquo;s fire safety system. Pipe temperatures can rise to 160 degrees if pumps are accidentally left on after weekly tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This protects against pump damage, which could cost the plant $20,000 per pump. But the greatest benefit is protection of personnel from burns,&amp;rdquo; Lyons said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Installation and commissioning of the devices were easy and the cost-effective, self-organizing network has performed without problems since start-up. It took company personnel about an hour to install each device; it would have taken an estimated two weeks to run cable to install a single wired monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of the great benefits of Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Smart Wireless devices is that we can install them ourselves instead of hiring contractors,&amp;rdquo; Lyons said. &amp;ldquo;The ability to do it ourselves in a fraction of the time delivered big savings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, SDG&amp;amp;E saved $15,000 to $20,000 per device, compared to a wired solution for each DP transmitter installed on the turbine air filters, because of the distance between the equipment and the control room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the Smart Wireless solutions already installed at SDG&amp;amp;E, Emerson offers a wide range of wireless field instrumentation and plant operations equipment, including Fisher position monitors, Rosemount analytical and Machinery Health Management devices, and native wireless interfaces to AMS Suite predictive maintenance software, and SmartStart services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because wireless is flexible and scalable, power producers can use the technology wherever it makes sense for their plant. By picking even one small application, users can achieve improvements that would not be possible in a traditional plant configuration. In addition to those at SDG&amp;amp;E, potential power plant applications include monitoring pressure relief valves, monitoring the corrosion in pipelines and vessels, monitoring temperatures at pre-heaters and pumps in order to improve thermal efficiencies, and freely deploying vibration analyzers &amp;ndash; even when the equipment itself is rotating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Vibration tester keeps the good stuff flowing at Alpenrose Dairy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At Alpenrose Dairy in Portland, Ore., operators process the raw milk into a dozen varieties of milk, six cultured products (cottage cheese and sour cream) and 31 flavors of ice cream. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to keep the complex Alpenrose production facility, with its hundreds of motors, pumps and gearboxes, running butter-smooth. But thanks to the new Fluke 810 Vibration Tester, it&amp;rsquo;s easier today to maintain Alpenrose as the cream of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn&amp;rsquo;t your average dairy. Family owned and operated since 1916, Alpenrose Dairy Inc. has evolved over time into a community entertainment center that includes Alpenrose Stadium, Dairyville, a replica of a western frontier town, a 600-seat opera house, a Quarter Midget racing arena and an Olympic-style bicycle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hub of this high-profile enterprise is the production plant, churning out dairy products that get to market the day they left the farm. Maintenance manager Eric Trummel and maintenance technician and electric motor expert Todd Toburen keep their fingers on the pulse of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke21.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the U.S. Navy, Toburen learned vibration analysis to find and diagnose electric motor problems. &amp;ldquo;We would take our readings and send the data to Annapolis. Annapolis would compile tons of data bouncing off of different frequencies and give us a call back to tell us whether it was good or bad,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;We would rewind and rebuild the motor and retest it, just to make sure what we sent out to the fleet was a good piece of equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pumps, motors, gearboxes and more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In his five years at Alpenrose, Toburen has taken charge of the hundreds of pumps, motors, gearboxes, compressors and other equipment required to operate a midsize dairy plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got equipment here that if it goes down, processing stops,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If the bad part is a high-dollar item, we don&amp;rsquo;t have sitting on the shelf. We could be down for a couple of days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the dairy business, where fresh products are essential, such an outage is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prevent such incidents, Alpenrose manages a more proactive maintenance program to help understand when a motor or machine may encounter problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our biggest concerns are the pieces of equipment that are critical to the processes,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If we see that there&amp;rsquo;s deterioration in the bearings or what have you, we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to schedule the downtime to take care of that problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But accuracy is key. Trummel recalls an incident when a vibration analysis contractor doing a semiannual check warned of bearing deterioration in an important air compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;He claimed that one of the bearings had gone bad, and that we needed to take care of it in the next couple of months,&amp;rdquo; Trummel said. &amp;ldquo;The next week, the coupling on the compressor disintegrated. The air compressor went down, and it represented a limitation of the plant. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized these guys may not know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. This is why this Fluke 810 is relevant to us. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have this capability in-house and check this equipment every couple of weeks. We get a better idea and a better feel for what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The handheld Fluke 810 is designed for maintenance professionals who need to troubleshoot mechanical problems and quickly understand the root cause of equipment condition. It&amp;rsquo;s programmed to diagnose the most common mechanical problems of unbalance, looseness, misalignment and bearing failures in a wide variety of mechanical equipment, including motors, fans, gearboxes, couplings, pumps, compressors and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The diagnostic technology in the Fluke 810 analyzes machinery condition and identifies faults by comparing vibration data to an extensive set of rules and algorithms developed over years of field experience. The Fluke 810 is not merely a vibration detector, but a complete diagnostic and problem-solving solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the Fluke, we&amp;rsquo;re able to take a reading once a week or once a month&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;If we notice something different, we can build a trend analysis with that data. If we notice there&amp;rsquo;s a change in our frequencies, that&amp;rsquo;s something we need to look at. Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able every single month to do every piece of equipment here at the dairy. We&amp;rsquo;ll prioritize what equipment we want to check on a monthly or a quarterly basis, and I&amp;rsquo;m basing that on what my baseline reading is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;The diagnosis was right on&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Machine operators form an important early warning system. If a machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel or sound right to them, Toburen troubleshoots the equipment with the Fluke 810 to see exactly what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The nice thing with this is you&amp;rsquo;re able to tell, &amp;lsquo;Is it the gearbox? Is it the compressor? Is it the motor? Is it the drive end? Is it the off end?&amp;rsquo; It even breaks it down to if you have a loose coupling or not,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fluke 810 also rates the level of severity of any problems it finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It has four different levels,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;Green being slight, yellow being moderate, orange being serious and red being extreme.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Toburen said it took some checking to fully trust the opinions of the Fluke 810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I had to develop a comfort level with the Fluke&amp;rsquo;s interpretation,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a bit of that. Somebody would come up and say they had a real loud motor. I&amp;rsquo;d go out and take a vibration analysis on it, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done that it&amp;rsquo;s come back as &amp;lsquo;extreme.&amp;rsquo; The Fluke will actually give you &amp;lsquo;loose bearing&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;bearing wear&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; it will give you the diagnosis. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the motors apart, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it, the diagnosis was right on. Then I&amp;rsquo;d also rebuild the motor, throw it on the workbench, put the 810 back on it and it comes back as either &amp;lsquo;no problem detected&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;slight wear or vibration.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Has the Fluke 810 saved money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;But being able to say there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with our equipment, troubleshoot that, get the parts on order, repair it in our downtime and bring it back up online &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s almost priceless. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that part on the shelf it could be two days out, and you&amp;rsquo;re not doing any processing. The amount you can save? It could be significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Doing what it takes to maintain custom textile equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In 1838, the Martin family began dyeing and finishing canvas for applications such as luggage, awnings, boxing ring covers, theater curtains, hunting apparel and medical bandages. To satisfy so many different customers, the family&amp;rsquo;s company has designed and built a wide range of custom machinery. But when a machine breaks down, Martin Corporation engineers and technicians cannot simply call in a service engineer from the manufacturer. They must fix it themselves, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Martin Corporation has been passed from father to son for nearly two centuries. It was founded in Philadelphia and moved to its current location in Bridgeton, N.J., in 1949. Plant engineer Thomas Martin, son of the current owner, states that the company has long developed its own production equipment. That&amp;rsquo;s partly because the machinery can be customized to exactly fit its production needs, and also because the company dyes and finishes canvas for a wide variety of applications, many in niche markets. Thus, its equipment requires a level of flexibility that most equipment suppliers overlook in favor of designing more specialized machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The fact that most of our production equipment has been engineered and manufactured in-house has allowed us to remain flexible to our customers&amp;rsquo; needs and competitive in the very challenging global textile market,&amp;rdquo; Martin said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s dyeing machines, or jigs, have two rollers that move the fabric back and forth as it passes through a bath of dye liquor or washing solution at a speed of 150 to 250 yards per minute. &amp;ldquo;Some of our machines date back to the 1950s, but we are continually upgrading ... their control and actuation systems,&amp;rdquo; Martin said. Each roller is powered by a hydraulic motor with electrohydraulic controls. Electric motors are used to drive the pumps that power the hydraulic system. The electric motors are controlled by variable frequency inverter drives, and the hydraulic pumps are controlled by electronic displacement controllers (EDCs) with ramp functions that prevent the rollers from being started or stopped too quickly. Encoders are integrated into the rollers to provide feedback to the EDCs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke011.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. The textiles plant has many motors, and they all get serviced and rebuilt in the in-house shop. Tom Martin uses the Fluke 1587 Digital Insulation Multimeter to test the motor&amp;rsquo;s internal windings and check their condition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You break it, you own it &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Of course, the fact that the company builds its own equipment means that it bears complete responsibility for maintenance and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have always had an exceptionally large maintenance department,&amp;rdquo; Martin said. &amp;ldquo;Our equipment operates continuously under very demanding conditions &amp;ndash; including corrosive liquids, high temperatures and high levels of humidity &amp;ndash; so breakdowns are a regular occurrence. And even when something is not broken, our maintenance department is busy trying to improve it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s early efforts to automate its equipment failed, in Martin&amp;rsquo;s opinion, because the company did not have the expertise to troubleshoot equipment in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Fixing broken production equipment does not satisfy customer orders, so for a long time, automation and electrical improvements were put on the back burner to improving overall mechanical reliability,&amp;rdquo; Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To keep production rolling, the maintenance staff would override the automation systems so production could continue. Then, approximately five years ago, Martin took over responsibility for maintenance of the electrical system and initiated new electrical troubleshooting methods that have greatly improved the plant machinery&amp;rsquo;s electrical reliability &amp;ndash; and the company&amp;rsquo;s ability to quickly and effectively troubleshoot and resolve problems as they arise.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke012.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Martin uses the new Fluke 233&amp;rsquo;s remote display to look at the supply voltage of one of the drive motors on the textile spooling machine. The remote display allows him to work at a safe distance from the moving machine parts and live voltage. To operate this machine and monitor live voltage would have been a two-person job in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Seeing&amp;rsquo; electricity &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I by no means consider myself a professional skilled test tool user, but rather a mechanical engineer who relies on my test tools to &amp;lsquo;see&amp;rsquo; electricity,&amp;rdquo; Martin said. &amp;ldquo;I use Fluke tools because they work so well. Most of the measurements we take arise in the process of solving problems or making an improvement. Now, when a machine stops operating because of a control system problem, instead of just overriding the system and operating the machine manually, I begin a troubleshooting process with the confidence that we can get the machine back into full automated operation quickly enough to avoid affecting our production targets. It is much more productive to troubleshoot and resolve a problem than to override automation &amp;ndash; making changes that will need to be reversed when the actual problem is addressed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Martin typically begins by looking at the minus-200- to plus-200-milliamp signal that controls the servo on the hydraulic pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Fluke 337 Clamp Meter is the first tool I use when, for example, an operator tells me that a machine seems to be slowing down, even though he has not touched the controls,&amp;rdquo; Martin said. &amp;ldquo;I throw it around the wire on the servo. If the servo is receiving current, this indicates the problem is in the servo or the pump. If the servo is not receiving current, then the problem is upstream, in the control system or wiring. In a matter of seconds, I can identify the general area of the problem. I can move the meter to the electric motor that drives the hydraulic pumps, and the amp reading gives me a general scale of how much tension the fabric is under. If the amperage is high, I would start looking for a mechanical problem, such as a bad bearing. If it is low, I would immediately suspect a problem in the control system.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the servo and pump are ruled out, Martin uses a Fluke 189 digital multimeter (DMM) to check the EDC. &amp;ldquo;I am waiting to replace the 189 with a 289, but it will just not die,&amp;rdquo; Martin laughed. He checks the output of the EDC to see if it is delivering a run signal. If so, then the problem most likely lies in the wiring between the EDC and servo. The next step is usually checking the resistor-capacitor circuit that ramps the EDC signal. He measures the capacitor and resistor with the 189, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke013.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Martin uses the Fluke 568 to look at the temperature of the drying drums in between fabric runs. The operator can dial in the temperature on the cans by setting the steam pressure. The typical temperature range is 215 to 275 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The jig operator control panel also controls a number of electronic solenoid-operated water valves on each machine that deliver hot and cold water to the baths and provide cooling water to the hydraulic system. The valves have an internal pilot valve that opens and closes a small orifice that in turn opens and closes the main valve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the past, we had no way to diagnose problems in the valves, so we would usually replace the whole valve and take it back to the shop for more extensive testing,&amp;rdquo; Martin recalled. &amp;ldquo;This involved a considerable amount of downtime. Now we can diagnose the valves in place and, in most cases, fix them with much less downtime because the min/max mode of the 189 is fast enough to provide a meaningful measurement of the voltage transient of the valves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the valves sometimes get stuck in the on or off position. Martin troubleshoots that problem by energizing the valve that he wants to open or close and then uses a 189 DMM to measure the peak of the voltage transient when the valve is de-energized. &amp;ldquo;These are 24-volt AC coils, and when a valve is working properly, there is typically only a measurable transient peak of 80 volts AC,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mechanical movement of the pilot inside the valve prolongs the transient spike but reduces the peak voltage measured. When the 189 indicates, for example, that the maximum voltage is 170 volts AC, it is a clear indication of a mechanical problem on the pilot side of the valve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;While, at first, even I thought measuring the transient spike was a useless measurement except for designing suppression circuitry, my 189 has proved to me that it has the performance and repeatability to provide meaningful information that can be used to troubleshoot mechanical performance inside a solenoid valve,&amp;rdquo; Martin said. &amp;ldquo;That one strange measurement has completely changed our ability to troubleshoot, diagnose and repair installed solenoid valves throughout the entire plant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recently, two temperature controllers failed. Operators normally address this type of failure by powering the controller down and sending an on/off signal to the steam valve operators manually. Instead, Martin used a Fluke 1587 Digital Insulation Multimeter to perform low-voltage insulation tests. These showed that the units were not shorted; rather, the problem was isolated to a single card that could easily be exchanged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Martin uses a Fluke VoltAlert to check whether wires are live or dead for personal protection before starting many troubleshooting tasks. He also uses the 189 meter for troubleshooting the variable frequency drives on pumps, electric solenoid valves and level sensors in the system used for recovering heat from the plant&amp;rsquo;s wastewater. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke014.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Martin uses the 773 Milliamp Process Clamp Meter to check the 4 mA to 20 mA signal between an electronic temperature controller and an electric-to-pneumatic pressure transducer that operates a steam valve. He compares the output percentage reading on the 773 with the output that the electronic controller displays in a diagnostics mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automation closes the loop &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Martin wants to incorporate more automation into the production equipment. He is developing a PC-based control system for the entire plant and all production equipment. The company has already installed humidity sensors to provide data for the new system. To calibrate and troubleshoot the sensors, Martin purchased a Fluke 971 Temperature Humidity Meter. &amp;ldquo;The 971 has quickly become a valuable tool for monitoring electrical enclosure temperatures,&amp;rdquo; he said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Martin views a PC-based system as the way to close the loop between the company&amp;rsquo;s production equipment and wastewater heat recovery systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I am designing the system to be easy to override in a non-permanent way to allow production equipment to operate reliably in a state with automation bypasses,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I decided a PC-based control solution was the best way to integrate multiple systems with quick and easy logic adjustments or overrides, without the need for physical wiring changes.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Martin said he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to implement such a system without the ability to accurately and efficiently diagnose electrical problems. &amp;ldquo;Fluke meters fulfill that need and provide a window into what is going on at the plant. They provide a visibility that enables me to quickly diagnose problems and then direct others to solve them. This saves the maintenance team time and, more importantly, enables us to keep production machinery operating with minimal interruptions to achieve higher levels of throughput and quality.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His most recent controls investment? The new Fluke 773 Milliamp Process Clamp Meter, for troubleshooting 4 mA to 20 mA signals. &amp;ldquo;While I previously had to break the circuit and use my DMM for inline current measurement, the clamp meter is a really slick little tool that definitely gets the job done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Increase profits and reduce maintenance costs for your facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Do you want to increase profits and reduce maintenance costs for your facility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is common knowledge that technologies such as vibration analysis, shaft alignment, oil analysis, thermal imaging, motor circuit testing and several other technologies are excellent tools to help achieve these results. These technologies can be used for the identification and elimination of machinery defects on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many facilities are content with the knowledge that machinery defects (bearing defects, gearbox defects, etc.) have been identified, scheduled for maintenance and ultimately repaired utilizing these technologies. An optimized reliability program will constantly seek the root causes that create the machinery defects, thereby avoiding many chronic and recurring problems. Most facilities believe that finding the root cause of equipment defects can be difficult. This may be true in some cases, but it is not always the reality. In fact, many of the actual root causes of equipment defects can be easily identified. The elimination of these root causes will reduce the amount of equipment defects that must be repaired over time, help you achieve the goal of reduced maintenance cost and increase profits at your company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is a method of finding what forcing function is causing unwanted harmful vibrations and the resulting defects in equipment. However, these defects can be very difficult to distinguish from one another when using only vibration data for identification. If the defect is not accurately identified, then incorrect or unnecessary maintenance may be completed on the equipment as a result. If the root causes are not identified, then the same repair will be repeated over time. All of this increases the overall cost of maintenance and reduces company profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Looseness-related conditions are some of the most common issues found in equipment and can be some of the easiest to correct. These conditions, if uncorrected, can create costly routine equipment defects and haunt maintenance staff. This results in continual equipment maintenance and higher repair cost. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mechanical looseness can be placed into one of two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Structural&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rotating element (component looseness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Structural looseness may act as a vibration amplifier. The stiffness of the equipment or structure changes as the looseness develops and increases in severity. This can allow the resonance frequency to change and overlap with another defect frequency in the machine. This will increase the defect amplitudes and cause the equipment to fail more quickly. Damage due to this effect can be very costly and is completely avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Structural looseness can be created by base mounting issues, bearing caps, casings, supports, improper/broken welds, etc. These types of conditions are difficult to identify and determine the root cause when using only vibration patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase data can often be used to determine the exact problem in the equipment when the vibration data does not provide a clear indication. Phase analysis is one of the most overlooked capabilities that can be used to identify and locate unwanted equipment defects such as structural looseness. Therefore, phase analysis is a very valuable diagnostic tool available to the analyst and can be easily used to identify the root cause of many equipment problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is critical that the analyst have a clear understanding of phase relationships before attempting any type of phase measurements. Phase is the relationship between two events in time. These events may occur in sync (in phase) or out of sync (out of phase) with each other. This distinction is very important and can easily be used to identify structural looseness issues. Phase readings collected on two measurement locations in close proximity to one another should have comparable values. Dissimilar phase values are an indication that the locations are vibrating out of sync (out of phase) with each other and looseness may be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moving the vibration sensor from one radial direction to another (vertical to horizontal) should result in approximately a 90-degree phase shift. Moving the sensor within the same radial direction (horizontal to horizontal or vertical to vertical) should result in approximately the same phase values. It is not uncommon to see a phase shift of approximately plus-or-minus 30 degrees when moving the vibration sensor from one measurement location to another, and this is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 shows equipment that has been checked for structural looseness. Notice that the measured phase readings remain very similar as the vibration sensor is moved within the same measurement plane. This indicates that no structural looseness issues are present on this side of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Equipment with no Structural Looseness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase should be measured across all bolted or welded joints. Phase readings will suddenly become erratic, from point to point, once a loose component/location is found. Often, the phase shift will change between 90 and 180 degrees from the previous measurement location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows a second machine that has been checked for structural looseness. Notice that the phase readings are very similar until a specific measurement location is reached. The phase readings suddenly change. X marks the spot, and the sudden change in phase values indicates a structural looseness issue at the specific measurement location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Equipment with Structural Looseness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase measurements can be used to identify loose mounting foot conditions in equipment as well (see Figure 3). A loose foot will show a phase shift from the foot to the foundation. Also, a phase difference from the suspect foot compared to the other machine feet should be observed. The phase shift is usually greater than 90 degrees. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig3.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another option now available to the analyst is the ability to collect relative phase measurements routinely in a route. This data can be trended over time along with other route-based measurement data (Figure 4). The trend data will show an indication as the equipment condition changes over time. This can be done without a tachometer signal by using a cross-channel phase measurement in the route. In fact, collecting route-based relative phase measurements is an excellent option for machines that have experienced expensive repairs or caused collateral damage due to looseness-related issues. This type of routine information may allow such expensive failures to be avoided and the integrity of the structure or equipment to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig4.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper preparation is imperative prior to conducting any phase measurements. The measurement locations should be clean of dirt, etc. A simple drawing should be created for identifying the desired measurement locations and recording the measured results. This drawing may be simple, but it will prove critical when analyzing the results. Figure 5 shows a simple outline that can be routinely used for phase measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phillipsfig5.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Sample Phase Outline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Basic phase data is not difficult to acquire and can provide a wealth of information. This information will help identify many of the root cause conditions that create equipment defects at your facility. These conditions can be eliminated and, as a result, reduce the amount of routine equipment failures experienced (bearing defects, etc.). This results in overall savings in maintenance costs and increased profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are expected to reduce maintenance costs and increase profits, do not overlook the technologies you may have available or may purchase. Do not assume that all of the functionality these technologies offer is complicated to use. Not providing these technologies to your maintenance staff or underutilizing the technologies you already have available will actually lead to increased maintenance costs and reduced profits.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SDT North America delivers powerful ultrasound for PdM pros</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The new SDT270 ultrasonic device from SDT North America represents an evolution for predictive maintenance and reliability professionals. Sporting many firsts, the SDT270 is consistent with SDT&amp;rsquo;s mission to design progressive and smart instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first portable ultrasound instrument to include both a built-in temperature sensor and a laser tachometer, the product also has an onboard SQL database to capture and manage survey data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Building Blocks&amp;rsquo; concept adds flexibility&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The SDT270 remains true to SDT&amp;rsquo;s reputation for intelligent instrument design. The company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;building blocks&amp;rdquo; concept combines options for hardware flexibility, software for data management, and sensors that promote ergonomics and ease of use. The SDT270, in combination with the Ultranalysis Suite, maintains simplicity for those who need it, while providing sophistication for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accurate and comparable wave files&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;SDT270 uses True Amplitude to give ultrasound inspectors, for the first time, the ability to maintain a database of accurate sound files. Each wave file is sampled 250,000 time per second. The result is clear, accurate and comparable time signals stored in the SDT270&amp;rsquo;s massive internal memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote support and training&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An ultrasound detector that connects to the Internet offers new levels of support options. Remote access for support, training and measurement triggering brings new possibilities to your ultrasound program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two channel inputs&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Two-channel sequential measurement means multiple sensors can connect to your SDT270 for faster collection of data. Store static data (dB&amp;mu;V), record dynamic sound files, measure temperature and RPM, and acceleration without exchanging sensors. The SDT270 redefines intelligent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	instrument design to make more efficient use of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SDT270&amp;rsquo;s upgradeable platforms&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The SDT270 Platform gives customization with the opportunity to upgrade as your program grows. Choose from six base formats, then add sensors and software to build a collector unique to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SDT270 is even more powerful with UAS software. UAS forms a synergistic partnership between your SDT270, your PC and your PdM team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UAS &amp;ndash; Ultranalysis Suite&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;UAS manages the collection, processing and analysis of data measured by the SDT270. It&amp;rsquo;s a library to store and organize information that&amp;rsquo;s easy to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	UAS manages static data (dB&amp;mu;V, degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, RPM, SCFM, dBA), as well as dynamic data (ultrasound signals for time and spectrum analysis). UAS&amp;rsquo;s tree structure allows for as large a database as you need, with the ability to organize smaller surveys so you can set your own pace. Synchronous databases resident on both your PC and your SDT270 allows on-the-fly creation of survey points.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Martinelliâs pursues the sweet taste of safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard how an apple a day can keep the doctor away. Since the Great Depression, cider maker S. Martinelli &amp;amp; Company has been urging consumers to &amp;ldquo;Drink Your Apple a Day&amp;rdquo; in a refreshing glass of juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The health and safety of his fellow workers is also a daily issue for Keith Morin, the facilities electrician at Martinelli&amp;rsquo;s 450,000-square-foot production facility in Watsonville, Calif., south of San Francisco. Morin believes that a solid industrial safety program is vital to keep accidents and all sorts of health problems at bay, so he has worked to instill the safety ethic among the hundreds of employees in Martinelli&amp;rsquo;s sprawling plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The juice making season begins in August as a new apple crop ripens, and Martinelli&amp;rsquo;s continues to produce millions of gallons of cider each week, working 24/7 until early May. Then the facility, the size of several football fields, shuts down as Morin, the only facilities electrician, 22 mechanics and 50 other year-round employees dig into their off-season maintenance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Making apple juice in an immaculately clean plant filled with glistening equipment of German stainless steel might look completely safe, but dangers are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;No. 1, we bottle juice, so we&amp;rsquo;re in a wet environment,&amp;rdquo; Morin said. &amp;ldquo;No. 2, we have broken glass, because bottles break. Those are the two biggest concerns that we have. And, there is noise. With that much glass in one place, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty noisy. Wearing safety protective gear is probably the most important thing in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke112.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Keith Morin compares heat signatures on MCC fuses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A single bottling line can fill 500 to 600 bottles a minute, so the cost of a shutdown mounts quickly &amp;ndash; and that creates its own hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When the plant&amp;rsquo;s down, it costs several hundred dollars a minute,&amp;rdquo; Morin said. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a rush to get things fixed, to get a motor swapped out or troubleshoot an electrical problem. That&amp;rsquo;s why we implemented the program, to make sure that everybody&amp;rsquo;s working safely, wearing their protective gear and trying to correct the problems in a safe manner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A safety program was in place, but &amp;ldquo;over the last three years we&amp;rsquo;ve built on that more and more because of OSHA requirements,&amp;rdquo; Morin said. &amp;ldquo;The State of California has probably the strictest safety program anywhere in the U.S., and a lot of other states have adopted what we&amp;rsquo;ve got here in California. It&amp;rsquo;s getting more stringent every year, and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to stay up to date. It helps the company and it helps everybody to work safely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ripe apples mean it&amp;rsquo;s safety season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With support from management, Morin established a formal safety program expanding on the existing effort. Safety training starts in August as the apple harvest begins and employees arrive. Though their employment is seasonal, many employees return each year. No matter how often they&amp;rsquo;ve been trained before, everyone goes through safety training and sanitation training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training is geared to the kind of work each trainee performs: operating processing equipment, working on the line trimming apples, moving finished product with a forklift, working in recycling or handling plant maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;General safety awareness is training for everyone:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Being aware of your surroundings, having first aid training, reporting anything you see broken &amp;ndash; really this is the basic stuff,&amp;rdquo; said Morin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke111.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Keith Morin using his Fluke 787 Process Meter to spot-check AC noise on a 4-20 mA loop. The panel is an air-activated valve control center in the filter department of the plant, and it contains 120 volts AC and a single 24-volt DC power supply for 4-20 mA level sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An intensified focus on order and cleanliness in the plant creates safer working conditions and an environment that supports the training program. After this introduction to safety, workers receive additional training targeted to the specific job they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator safety: &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Next, we move into how you operate the equipment,&amp;rdquo; Morin said. &amp;ldquo;All the machinery is equipped for safety &amp;ndash; with safety doors and so on &amp;ndash; but we make sure they shut the equipment off if they&amp;rsquo;re going to reach a hand inside and take all the proper steps before interacting with a machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The forklift drivers who move finished product receive special training on safe operating procedures. Those using scissor lifts for overhead work get a special class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Chemical safety: &lt;/strong&gt;A separate chemical safety program ensures that the daily plant sanitization process proceeds without hazard. Employees use bleach to keep the plant glistening, and ammonia plays an important part in the production process. Employees receive special training on safe ways to work with these chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Electrical safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Each mechanic receives five to six hours of safety training annually. As the sole professional electrician at Martinelli&amp;rsquo;s, Morin makes sure mechanics know the dangers of electricity and follow his &amp;ldquo;test before you touch&amp;rdquo; approach. Morin checks for voltage using a vibrating tester because he can &amp;ldquo;feel the live voltage&amp;rdquo; if it&amp;rsquo;s present. Other safe operating procedures, such as standing to the side when turning breakers on or off, are also part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year, Morin is emphasizing arc flash hazards, and his company is considering the purchase of fire-resistant uniforms and arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended under National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) electrical safety standard 70E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key is lockout/tagout procedures, which Morin teaches with a special California twist: lockout/tagout/blockout. &amp;ldquo;It used to be just Lockout/Tagout,&amp;rdquo; Morin said, &amp;ldquo;but in California it&amp;rsquo;s called lockout/blockout. The reason we do that is because you can lock something out and tag it out, but most of the systems we&amp;rsquo;re using can still contain kinetic energy. An assembly line could move, a press could come down, so we need to block it in some way so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally move. A lot of people have never heard of that before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is safety working? Bingo!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The safety emphasis involves everyone, from line workers to management. Safety is now a standing agenda item when supervisors meet every Wednesday. And, Martinelli&amp;rsquo;s makes its focus on safety fun with a program called Safety Bingo. For every day without a safety incident, the company adds $1 to a bingo pot. As the pot grows, the focus on safety intensifies, because with any accident, the pot goes back to $25. Every day a new bingo number is posted, and employees have a new chance to win the pot. Employees are divided into four teams, and four Safety Bingo games are going all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I think the most we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten up to was more than 200 days without an incident,&amp;rdquo; Morin said.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kinetic Systems offers vibration surveys for sensitive equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems Inc., a manufacturer of vibration-control workstations and optical tables, offers vibration surveys for new buildings or existing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ascertain potentially damaging vibration amplitudes and frequencies in customer facilities, engineers from Kinetic Systems conduct thorough on-site surveys using a portable Fourier analyzer, high-sensitivity accelerometers, and advanced data-acquisition systems. They measure vertical and horizontal vibrations over the required frequency range and average the data over time to produce amplitude and velocity spectra of the facility&amp;rsquo;s normal vibration levels. Further analysis takes into account the weights, &amp;ldquo;footprints,&amp;rdquo; cg (centers of gravity), and expected uses of the devices to be protected, as well as the maximum allowable vibration and other specifications from equipment manufacturers. Kinetic Systems engineers are also trained to perform more advanced testing with impulse-response techniques when necessary. Finally, the data is plotted on graphs (log-scale, narrow-bandwidth spectrums, modified to octave or third-octave bands) and supplied to the customer in a complete report. If vibration control is recommended, the report will detail the degree of protection necessary and how to provide an efficient, cost-effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems provides vibration-isolation equipment for high-precision work such as biotechnology research, certain manufacturing operations (optics, semiconductors, etc.), and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kinetic Systems is a leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of vibration isolation equipment, optical tables, and related components.

            <title>An introduction to machinery vibration</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In simplest terms, vibration in motorized equipment is merely the back and forth movement or oscillation of machines and components, such as drive motors, driven devices (pumps, compressors and so on) and the bearings, shafts, gears, belts and other elements that make up mechanical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration in industrial equipment can be both a sign and a source of trouble. Other times, vibration just &amp;ldquo;goes with the territory&amp;rdquo; as a normal part of machine operation, and should not cause undue concern. But how can the plant maintenance professional tell the difference between acceptable, normal vibration and the kind of vibration that requires immediate attention to service or replace troubled equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a basic understanding of vibration and its causes &amp;ndash; and equipped with a vibration testing device &amp;ndash; the maintenance professional can quickly and reliably determine the cause and severity of most machine vibration and receive recommendations for repair. It&amp;rsquo;s all done with the intelligence built into the tester, without the extensive monitoring and recording required for typical, long-term vibration monitoring programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration is not always a problem. In some tasks, vibration is essential. Machines such as oscillating sanders and vibratory tumblers use vibration to remove materials and finish surfaces. Vibratory feeders use vibration to move materials. In construction, vibrators are used to help concrete settle into forms and compact fill materials. Vibratory rollers help compress asphalt used in highway paving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other cases, vibration is inherent in machine design. For instance, some vibration is almost unavoidable in the operation of reciprocating pumps and compressors, internal combustion engines, and gear drives. In a well-engineered, well-maintained machine, such vibration should be no cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke101.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When vibration is a problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Most industrial devices are engineered to operate smoothly and avoid vibration, not produce it. In these machines, vibration can indicate problems or deterioration in the equipment. If the underlying causes are not corrected, the unwanted vibration itself can cause additional damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we are focused not on machines that are &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to vibrate as part of normal operation, but on those that should not vibrate: electric motors, rotary pumps and compressors, and fans and blowers. In these devices, smoother operation is generally better, and a machine running with zero vibration is the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most common causes of machine vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Vibration can result from a number of conditions, acting alone or in combination. Keep in mind that vibration problems may be caused by auxiliary equipment, not just the primary equipment. These are some of the major causes of vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Imbalance &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; A &amp;ldquo;heavy spot&amp;rdquo; in a rotating component will cause vibration when the unbalanced weight rotates around the machine&amp;rsquo;s axis, creating a centrifugal force. Imbalance could be caused by manufacturing defects (machining errors, casting flaws) or maintenance issues (deformed or dirty fan blades, missing balance weights). As machine speed increases, the effects of imbalance become greater. Imbalance can severely reduce bearing life as well as cause undue machine vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Misalignment/shaft runout &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Vibration can result when machine shafts are out of line. Angular misalignment occurs when the axes of (for example) a motor and pump are not parallel. When the axes are parallel but not exactly aligned, the condition is known as parallel misalignment. Misalignment may be caused during assembly or develop over time, due to thermal expansion, components shifting or improper reassembly after maintenance. The resulting vibration may be radial or axial (in line with the axis of the machine) or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wear &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; As components such as ball or roller bearings, drive belts or gears become worn, they may cause vibration. When a roller bearing race becomes pitted, for instance, the bearing rollers will cause a vibration each time they travel over the damaged area. A gear tooth that is heavily chipped or worn, or a drive belt that is breaking down, can also produce vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Looseness &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Vibration that might otherwise go unnoticed may become obvious and destructive if the component that is vibrating has loose bearings or is loosely attached to its mounts. Such looseness may or may not be caused by the underlying vibration. Whatever its cause, looseness can allow any vibration present to cause damage, such as further bearing wear, wear and fatigue in equipment mounts and other components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effects of vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The effects of vibration can be severe. Unchecked machine vibration can accelerate rates of wear (i.e. reduce bearing life) and damage equipment. Vibrating machinery can create noise, cause safety problems and lead to degradation in plant working conditions. Vibration can cause machinery to consume excessive power and may damage product quality. In the worst cases, vibration can damage equipment so severely as to knock it out of service and halt plant production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet there is a positive aspect to machine vibration. Measured and analyzed correctly, vibration can be used in a preventive maintenance program as an indicator of machine condition, and help guide the plant maintenance professional to take remedial action before disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characteristics of vibration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To understand how vibration manifests itself, consider a simple rotating machine like an electric motor. The motor and shaft rotate around the axis of the shaft, which is supported by a bearing at each end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One key consideration in analyzing vibration is the direction of the vibrating force. In our electric motor, vibration can occur as a force applied in a radial direction (outward from the shaft) or in an axial direction (parallel to the shaft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An imbalance in the motor, for instance, would most likely cause a radial vibration as the &amp;ldquo;heavy spot&amp;rdquo; in the motor rotates, creating a centrifugal force that tugs the motor outward as the shaft rotates through 360 degrees. A shaft misalignment could cause vibration in an axial direction (back and forth along the shaft axis), due to misalignment in a shaft coupling device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key factor in vibration is amplitude, or how much force or severity the vibration has. The farther out of balance our motor is, the greater its amplitude of vibration. Other factors, such as speed of rotation, can also affect vibration amplitude. As rotation rate goes up, the imbalance force increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequency refers to the oscillation rate of vibration, or how rapidly the machine tends to move back and forth under the force of the condition or conditions causing the vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequency is commonly expressed in cycles per minute or hertz (CPM or Hz). One Hz equals one cycle per second or 60 cycles per minute. Though we called our example motor &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo;, even this machine can exhibit a complex vibration signature. As it operates, it could be vibrating in multiple directions (radially and axially), with several rates of amplitude and frequency. Imbalance vibration, axial vibration, vibration from deteriorating roller bearings and more all could combine to create a complex vibration spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Vibration is a characteristic of virtually all industrial machines. When vibration increases beyond normal levels, it may indicate only normal wear &amp;ndash; or it may signal the need for further assessment of the underlying causes, or for immediate maintenance action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding why vibration occurs and how it manifests itself is a key first step toward preventing vibration from causing trouble in the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Fluke 810 Vibration Tester takes it from there. This advanced handheld device is designed and programmed to diagnose the most common mechanical problems of unbalance, looseness, misalignment and bearing failures in a wide variety of mechanical equipment, including motors, fans, blowers, belts and chain drives, gearboxes, couplings, pumps, compressors, closed coupled machines and spindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fluke 810 quickly detects vibration along three planes of movement, then provides a plain-text diagnosis with a recommended solution. The diagnostic technology in the Fluke 810 analyzes machine operation and identifies faults by comparing vibration data to an extensive set of rules developed over years of field experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typical vibration analyzers and software are intended for monitoring machine condition over the longer term, but they require special training and investment that may not be possible in many companies. The Fluke 810 is designed specifically for maintenance professionals who need to troubleshoot mechanical problems and quickly understand the root cause of equipment condition.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using PdM technologies to determine, optimize lube condition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The life and reliability of greased machinery depend on proper bearing lubrication. Unfortunately, inadequate grease lubrication is a very common failure mode. With greased bearings, it is difficult to determine lubricant state along with knowing when to grease, how to grease and when to stop greasing. Fortunately, predictive technologies and work processes are being successfully applied to monitor and optimize the lubrication condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improper lubrication creates energy that manifests itself as mechanical stress energy and thermal energy (heat). By analyzing this energy using predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies, much can be learned about the bearing lubrication condition. This article discusses and compares the use of ultrasonic analysis, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration signal processing techniques as means toward determining lubrication state and achieving optimum lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, this article will look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics and progression of lubrication stress,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		an overview and comparision of
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				ultrasonic analysis&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				conventional vibration analysis and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				advanced vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the strengths and weakness of each monitoring method,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics of various lubricant states obtained in a controlled test environment, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		equipment lubrication case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traditional greasing programs use time-based preventive maintenance (PM). This method can result in over- or under-greasing, depending on the recommended periodicity of greasing, operating conditions and run time of the machinery. One plant surveyed stated that 90 percent of all motor failures were grease related &amp;ndash; both over- and under-greasing. This particular plant was using motor manufacturer recommendations as the foundation of their greasing program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An alternative greasing program uses PdM processes and technologies. Using PdM, greasing activities are based on the condition of the grease. Several PdM technologies for grease monitoring are available. Vibration tends to be the most common tool used. However, most commonly used vibration techniques do not detect early lubrication faults. Infrared is also an option, although it is not preferred since initial lubrication starvation has little impact on temperature. Some sources maintain grease sampling and analysis is the best method. However, in most circumstances, this is not practical. Many bearings do not have an access port to the grease and those that do present their own problems. The grease samples taken most likely do not represent the true condition of the grease inside the bearing and may also contain particulate and contamination picked up during the sampling. Ultrasonic analysis and advanced vibration signal processing are viable methods of monitoring grease condition since they measure the stress energy caused by friction between the rolling and sliding elements in the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: The Characteristics and Progression of Lubrication Stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In rolling element bearings, lubrication sound is created by friction-induced stress waves from the interaction of the roller to the race and the roller to the cage. Good roller-to-race interaction is rolling with elastohydrodynamic lubrication. Good roller-to-cage interaction is sliding with hydrodynamic lubrication. Assuming a RMS surface roughness of 0.3 micron, &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; shows that the minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-race is 1 micron, or approximately 1/75 the thickness of a human hair. The minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-cage is 10 microns. As lubrication starvation occurs, the film thickness will decrease, resulting in a greater coefficient of friction. The greater coefficient of friction creates additional energy in the form of heat and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lube sound characteristics for under-lubricated bearings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		high frequency energy,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		broadband energy, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		primarily random and non-periodic noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency domain of an under-lubricated bearing. Note the high-frequency energy hump in the 20 to 32 kilohertz (KHz) range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency and time domain for a gearbox running with an incorrectly installed oil pump. Note the high frequency in the 10 KHz to 20 KHz range. This energy probably continues to higher frequency range but shows a drop-off due to the accelerometer range and mounting conditions. The time domain shows a raised noise floor with random high spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the lubrication in a bearing degrades, the high-frequency sound characteristics change. A properly lubricated bearing creates random noise with a low noise flow. As the lubricant degrades, the noise floor begins to elevate (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 1&lt;/a&gt;). Listening to a heterodyned 30 KHz signal, the sound is like a waterfall or rushing river. As the lube degrades, spiking begins as the noise floor elevates which sounds like a mild popping sound (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 2&lt;/a&gt;). Severe lubrication faults cause more frequent high-amplitude spikes, which sound like bacon sizzling. In Chart 2, as grease was added, the noise floor immediately lowered and the spiking disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do not expect bearing to display the same sound characteristics. The amplitudes, sound patterns and frequencies of the stress energy are influenced by factors such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bearing geometry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Roller design and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Load&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cage design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Type of lubricant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following summarizes key points related to the characteristics of lubrication sound/stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		As lubrication condition degrades, stress energy increases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication stress energy is broadband, high frequency (about 8 KHz and higher) and random.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Other sources of high-frequency stress energy exist, such as:
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Bearing/gear defects, electrical &amp;ndash; periodic&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Rubs, fluid turbulence &amp;ndash; random&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; To evaluate lube condition, high-frequency diagnostic tools that can measure and differentiate random from periodic noise are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: Overview and Comparison of Ultrasonic Analysis, Conventional Vibration Analysis, and Advanced Vibration Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When monitoring for lubrication faults, sensor selection is critical. Sensors are not the same, so the characteristics of a sensor must be understood. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt; shows the sensor performance of several different diagnostic technologies. The red broad-band sensor would be a poor choice because the high-frequency sounds would be drowned out by the low-frequency noise. The blue narrow-band sensor in the bearing fault area would completely miss any lubricant stress noise. The black broad-band sensor represents a typical accelerometer. It may have a response in the lubrication range, but mounting techniques are critical (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;). The blue narrow-band sensor in the lubrication area has good sensitivity and completely isolates itself from lower-frequency noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt; shows that when using an accelerometer to monitor lubrication stress, either a flat magnet on a clean machined surface or a permanently mounted accelerometer must be used to get the required frequency response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five technologies to identify and monitor lubrication faults are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Infrared thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening using an accelerometer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ultrasonic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conventional vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Vibration analysis with advanced signal processing using PeakVue and Autocorrelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next few paragraphs will briefly introduce each of these technologies. This will be followed by side-by-side comparison test results for the latter three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is good for detecting possible late-stage lubrication problems. It is not good for catching lubrication problems early. Also, additional technologies will be required to confirm the source of the abnormal temperature signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some vibration analyzers have a headphone output to listen to the accelerometer output (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;). This can be used to listen to the noise within the bearing. A high-pass filter on the sound output is very useful to filter out the low-frequency noise so that the lubrication noise can be heard. This is a quick qualitative method that provides good signal pattern information. It can also indicate a drop in volume, while greasing can indicate that the grease has reached the rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic monitoring provides both listening capability and quantitative measurements (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt;). The ultrasonic sound is heterodyned into our listening range, and specific sound parameters are measured. The ultrasonic device should isolate the higher frequencies and filter out all lower-frequency noise. If the ultrasonic device uses a narrow-band sensor or resonant sensor, mounting is much easier than with an accelerometer. Generally, just placing the probe on a clean surface provides a good signal. Paint and other obstructions will lower the signal amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conventional vibration analysis analyzes macro vibration &amp;ndash; the motion of a body. It focuses on the lower-frequency events. For an 1,800 rpm motor, a typical maximum frequency would be 60 times running speed, or 1,800 hertz (Hz). &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 9&lt;/a&gt; shows a typical frequency domain plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CSI PeakVue measurement is an advanced signal-processing method. It performs micro vibration analysis, which measures the microscopic movement (stress waves) within a body. It analyzes the energy above the conventional analysis range. PeakVue is not an averaging process, so it captures the true peak amplitude values from the high-frequency information. To create the PeakVue time waveform, the accelerometer signal is routed through a high-pass filter to cut out all low-frequency information. The signal is sampled at more than 100,000 times per second. This digital data stream is broken into data blocks which are a function of the desired Fmax. The only value saved for each data block is the true peak &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; amplitude value. These true peak G levels create the PeakVue time waveform. This PeakVue time waveform is then processed to create a PeakVue frequency domain spectrum (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PeakVue provides a window into the area where lubrication data is located. The nature of lubrication faults make the PeakVue time domain data noisy and difficult to interpret. To assist with this, another advanced signal-processing technique, CSI Autocorrelation, can be applied. Autocorrelation is an averaging process to remove random activity from the time domain. The resultant correlation factor (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11&lt;/a&gt;) is proportional to the amount of periodic energy. If at any point on the correlated waveform the correlation factor is small, then almost all of the energy at that point is random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12&lt;/a&gt; shows a test motor. To compare ultrasonic, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration analysis, the top inboard bearing was monitoring both with and without lubricant. The next few paragraphs will compare the results from the three technologies. For the vibration measurements, a mounting pad was glued to a machine flat on the bearing housing. A flat magnet with accelerometer was attached to the pad. A CSI SonicScan was the ultrasonic test device. It measured both lower-frequency energy (4 KHz) and ultrasonic energy (30 KHz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13&lt;/a&gt; compares the time domain data for the three technologies. The conventional vibration data shows almost no difference between lubrication states. PeakVue clearly measures the stress energy caused by the lubrication fault. The SonicScan data was consistent. The lower-frequency energy measurement showed some but little change. The ultrasonic data showed significant change in both the average reading and peak amplitude reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the frequency domains. With conventional vibration, a slight change in periodic activity is noticed. This is likely because the existing bearing mechanical defects are being amplified a little without lubricant. The PeakVue spectrum shows a dramatic increase in stress energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PeakVue time domain for the no-lubricant condition is messy and hard to interpret. When the Autocorrelation is performed (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15&lt;/a&gt;), it is immediately apparent that almost all of the stress energy is random, which is a primary characteristic of lubrication faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Table 1 provides a summary comparison of the discussed technologies. The left side of the table shows technology features that make testing accurate and easy. Accelerometer listening and conventional vibration analysis will not provide good results. Headphones should be used when performing advanced vibration analysis to add a very important qualitative attribute. Advanced vibration analysis provides the best information for determining lubrication condition but requires additional vibration analysis training and special sensor mounting. Ultrasonics provides a good indication of lubrication condition (without access to detailed signature analysis tools) and are easy to use but also require some specialized training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: Characteristics of Various Lubricant States Obtained in a Controlled Test Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To better understand and verify theoretical assumption, a lubrication test stand was built for controlled lubrication testing. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 16&lt;/a&gt; shows the test stand that was used to collect the controlled grease lubrication testing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor drives a control, idler and test bearing. Grease can be introduced into each bearing through its outer race using a zerk fitting on the bearing housing. The idler bearing can be variably loaded to 1,000 pounds. The bearings tested were sealed SKF single-row ball bearings with nine balls. The bearings have an ABEC 1 rating and were driven at 1,780 rpm. For each lubrication condition, peak and average decibel (dB) levels were measured at three frequency ranges. The ranges were 30 kHz (lubrication range), 4 kHz (impact range) and 40 kHz (traditional ultrasonic range). The peak dB level records the highest signal amplitude, such as in a spike, during a data collection period. The average dB level records the average of all the signal peaks during a data collection period and is least affected by spikes. The sound parameters were collected using a Model 7100 SonicScan analyzer using a magnet mount sensor. A magnet mount sensor allowed for hands-free operation and greater repeatability. The temperature was monitored on the bearing housing using a CSI Model 515 spot radiometer with laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, to evaluate the effects on sound of over-lubrication, a new bearing running at steady state under load was slowly greased until grease squeezed through the seals (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 18&lt;/a&gt; shows no significant increase in sound up to 12 minutes after over-greasing. Over-greasing did create a 7 percent rise in the temperature on the outside of the bearing housing. It should be noted that the rate of grease oxidation and deterioration will increase with increasing temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, to evaluate the effects of under-lubrication, a new bearing with seals removed was brought to steady-state temperature under full load. The bearing was stopped long enough to wipe grease off of one side of the bearing and then retested. The bearing was then washed in solvent to remove all grease (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 19&lt;/a&gt;) and then retested. When the bearing with no grease was approaching total failure, it was progressively regreased and monitored for 30 minutes until it reached steady state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt; shows results from lubricant starvation and then re-lubrication. The dB levels increase with deteriorating lube conditions and they decrease with improving lubrication conditions. The temperature remains constant except when lubricant is absent. While temperature is a good indicator of total lube starvation, it was not a good indicator of partial lube starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seen from &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt;, the initial re-lubrication made a significant improvement in sound level and temperature even though only one pump, or 0.04 ounces of grease, was introduced. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 21&lt;/a&gt; shows the sound waveform (heterodyned 30 kHz audio output from SonicScan) immediately prior to and after the first pump of grease. A very distinct drop in level occurs when the grease hits the rollers. Additional greasing resulted in a minor sound level decrease and a negligible effect on temperature. Permanent damage likely occurred to the bearing since the sound levels did not return to their original levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in a controlled environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a poor technology for monitoring over-lubrication since over-lubrication does not significantly affect the sound parameters,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature analysis is a good technology for monitoring over-lubrication since it does significantly increase with over-greasing; however, in the field, be aware of process and environmental effects on the temperature,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a good technology for monitoring normal and under-lubricated bearings since the sound levels increase with deteriorating conditions and decrease with improving conditions,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication problems that are not corrected in early stages will result in permanent mechanical damage, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening during greasing for a decrease in the sound level is a good indicator of grease entering the bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: Equipment Lubrication Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication ultrasonic analysis was performed on the following operating industrial equipment: food processing conveyor bearings, 75-horsepower General Electric motors, and 450 HP Baldor motor. The conveyor testing occurred during a single day, while the motor testing occurred over a seven-month period. The testing confirmed and validated the characteristics of lubrication sound and the findings from the controlled environment testing. The instrument used to analyze the sound was a CSI Model 7100 SonicScan with a multi-frequency contact probe (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 22&lt;/a&gt;) instead of a magnet mount sensor. Measurements were taken on the top of the zerk fitting. In general, contact probe measurements are not as repeatable as magnet mount sensor because of variable contact angles and pressures. The advantage of the contact probe is that it can easily fit into tight places and can be used on zerk fittings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Processing Conveyor Bearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The survey included 13 bearings from a conveyor in a food processing plant. Most of the bearings were pressure-washed frequently with water and greased daily. Bearing No. 11 was elevated above floor level, in a difficult-to-reach position, and apparently not greased regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each bearing was tested three times before greasing and three times after greasing. Of all the bearings that were greased daily, the additional greasing had little or no effect on the bearing sound. Greasing significantly affected bearing No. 11. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 23&lt;/a&gt; shows a summary of the readings taken at both the 4 kHz and 30 kHz frequency ranges. It also shows the peak (PH) and average (AV) readings at each frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For each set of columns, the first column shows the mean dB reading of all 13 bearings. The second column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 before greasing. The third column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 after greasing. In both the 4 kHz peak and 4 kHz average readings, bearing No. 11 was slighter higher than mean before greasing and slightly lower than mean after greasing. The 30 kHz peak reading shows a significantly elevated dB before greasing and a significant dB drop after greasing. The greatest change occurred with the 30 kHz average reading with the average reading dropping from the upper 20s to almost zero. In this test, the 30 kHz average reading was the most sensitive parameter for measuring lubrication condition. It should also be noted that permanent mechanical damage was unlikely since the 4 kHz peak (mechanical impact) reading dropped to below mean and the 30 kHz average (lubrication) reading dropped to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headphones were used with the SonicScan to provide additional qualitative information. Unfortunately, in this environment, a lot of noise existed in all of the measurements. Metal cans were clattering on the conveyor, belts were sliding and the background was loud. For these or other reasons, the headphones did not provide useful information in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;75 HP General Electric Motors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 75 HP General Electric motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive blowers. Each bearing has a single shield toward the rotor. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 12 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 24&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. Notice that the inboard bearing dB level dropped to almost zero after greasing and remained constant through 766 hours. The outboard bearing performed similarly except that the dB level began to increase after 358 hours. This could be caused by a lot of factors, such as possibly only a small amount of the grease that entered the cavity actually made to it the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 25&lt;/a&gt; shows a similar plot for a second 75 HP General Electric motor. The 30 kHz sound level performed as expected. The 4 kHz dB level seemed to not be affected by greasing. The 4 kHz dB levels very likely can be affected by noise from other machinery and processes since sonic sound travels through material much better and attenuates much slower than ultrasonic signals. The 40 kHz signal did not perform as expected. In general, the 40 kHz signal is less reliable since the amount of lubrication energy created at 40 kHz is less than what is created at 30 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;450 HP Baldor Motor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 450 HP Baldor Super E motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive large blowers. Each bearing is neither shielded nor sealed. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock. Access to the grease vents is restricted because of the design of the motor mount. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 24 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 26&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. At 3,411 hours, the bearing was greased &amp;ndash; first four pumps and then an additional four pumps. With the 30 kHz readings, the sound levels dropped significantly, while they increased slightly with additional grease. Because of this increase, greasing was stopped. Only after 552 hours, the sound level returned to its previous level, that is most likely a state of adequate lubrication. Like with the GE motors, the 4 kHz sound was not affected by the greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 27&lt;/a&gt; charts another Baldor motor bearing. At 30 kHz, this bearing has a steady sound level until 3,278 hours. After greasing, the sound level dropped back close to the previous level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in an industrial environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In all of the GE and Baldor bearings, the 30 kHz average reading provided the most predictable readings. The 40 kHz readings generally followed the 30 kHz readings but were less consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greasing did not affect the 4 kHz readings. The 4 kHz reading can be very useful in analyzing the bearing&amp;rsquo;s mechanical condition or as a confirmation technique for conventional vibration analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Trying to determine lubrication condition by listening alone is ineffective since the lubrication sound is primarily white noise. Quantifiable and repeatable analysis is required to accurately assess lubrication condition. The qualitative information from listening is very useful for general listening and checking for other problems. It can also be useful during lubrication to determine when grease enters the bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		For all of the industrial bearings tested, optimum or baseline lubrication levels (30 kHz frequency and average sound parameter) were around 10 dB or lower. The normal operating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lubrication levels were around 10 to 20 dB. For the test stands bearing and conveyor bearing, the critical level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;before permanent damage occurred was around 30 dB. This would imply that the greasing level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;should occur between 20 and 30 dB. These estimates are very general. More exact levels should be determined by type of bearing and application. This could be accomplished through testing and long-term trending.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All the bearing testing did not exhibit a standard lubrication cycle except that increasing hours eventually resulted in increasing sound levels and that re-lubrication resulted in decreasing sound levels except for the case of already over-lubricated bearings. Specific lubrication cycles for specific bearings could be understood through long-term trending. This would provide much information on the real-time lubrication condition and projected performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By trending the sound levels along with the lubrication intervals and grease amounts, the grease interval and volume can be optimized. The most favorable temperatures will be obtained when the bearing is supplied with the minimum quantity of lubricant to provide proper lubrication. Therefore, as a general rule, less grease is better than more grease. The trending will reveal the cause and effect of lubrication quantity on lubrication condition and interval. Lubrication monitoring with vibration was performed on a pump, scrubber fan and exhaust blower.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 28&lt;/a&gt; shows the conventional vibration data for a pump. This data shows no indication of a lubrication fault. The PeakVue data for the same pump shows high G levels and random patterns which could indicate a lubrication fault (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 29&lt;/a&gt;). The autocorrelation of the PeakVue waveform confirms that the energy is almost all random (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 30&lt;/a&gt;). The pump locked up one month later due to lack of lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next vibration case history is for a scrubber fan. The PeakVue data on April 19 (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 31&lt;/a&gt;) was below the alert level. On May 29, the PeakVue data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 32&lt;/a&gt;) was in alarm with a 500 percent increase in G amplitude. The autocorrelation of the May 29 data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 33&lt;/a&gt;) revealed no periodicity. This random high-frequency energy is a strong indicator of a lubrication fault. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 34&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the PeakVue time waveforms. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 35&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the conventional time waveform data. Note that no increase occurred with the conventional data (Fmax of 3 KHz). The source of the lubrication fault was a faulty oiler bowl. As soon as the oiler bowl was fixed, the PeakVue data returned to normal levels (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third vibration equipment case study is for an exhaust blower. A new type of grease with limestone and graphite additives was used. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 37&lt;/a&gt; shows the frequency domain before and after the new grease was added. The new grease caused significant high-frequency energy &amp;ndash; 8 KHz and higher. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 38&lt;/a&gt; shows the PeakVue time domain comparison. Notice the large increase in friction energy because of the different lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These three equipment case studies show that advanced vibration analysis using PeakVue and autocorrelation are effective techniques to identify and monitor lubrication condition. They also show that conventional vibration analysis is not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To achieve optimum lubrication, it is important to be able to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the lubrication condition at any time;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the conditions when re-lubrication is necessary;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the volume of grease required for re-greasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As seen from this article, multiple predictive technologies can provide immediate information about the lubrication condition while the equipment is operating. Each of these technologies has strengths and limitations. For effective lubrication monitoring, each of the technology&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses must be understood along with the physical characteristics of lubrication energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication analysis using advanced vibration analysis should be performed on all critical machines, especially if the equipment is already being monitored for bearing defects. If equipment is critical enough to warrant vibration analysis, then the lubrication can be monitored as a part of that process. Many companies do not monitor lubrication because of the cost to prepare a proper mounting surface for the accelerometer. This cost is insignificant when compared to the cost of a lubrication fault in terms of lost production, lost equipment life and higher maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When lubrication analysis is combined with good trending and monitoring, greasing intervals and amounts can be optimized. All of this results in knowing the equipment better and being better able to maintain it, extend its life, and predict its performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>10 steps to prepare your company for the return of business</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you are like many in business today, during the past year it has been a challenge to just survive the &amp;ldquo;Great Recession.&amp;rdquo; Many companies have had to focus solely on survival, cutting workforce and other expenses just to survive to fight another day. Now that companies are starting to see some signs of rebounding demand, the question is, &amp;ldquo;Are you and your assets properly prepared to capitalize on this increased business when the demand arrives?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the downturn, many companies laid off experienced maintenance technicians and production operators, reduced production shifts, idled equipment, and spent the bare minimum, if anything, on maintaining their assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These 10 steps offer a cohesive approach to cost-effectively prepare your company&amp;rsquo;s physical assets and mitigate the risk associated with higher levels of demand for the return of business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that you have properly identified your value streams, constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;As demand for business or products that you used to produce returns and you add additional new business, it is important that you consider the effect that the additional volume will have on your flow and throughput. Unless you chose to outsource a specific portion of your prior process or downsized your capacity through equipment rationalization, you likely had very little or virtually no capacity constraints during the past year. Returning demand from prior products coupled with demand generated by new business can quickly result in capacity constraints. Any additional capacity or improvement to the cycle time of the constraint will result in additional saleable product throughput for the area.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Perform a general inspection of the constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Often times, it is necessary to re-instill the discipline to clean specific areas of the equipment, removing chips, debris or fluids that may have built up and started to affect the quality or potential longevity of the process. Depending upon the level of deterioration, you may need or want to accomplish this through a kaizen event focused on cleaning the equipment so that a more thorough inspection can be accomplished. All non-conforming issues should be noted, documented with a specific work order, captured in the CMMS and planned/scheduled for repair at the first convenient, available time.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Utilize predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies to perform a deeper evaluation of the specific condition of the constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Utilize ultrasonic equipment to inspect for hard-to-find leaks and an infrared camera to look for hot spots caused by loose or broken connections and bearings or motors that may be getting ready to fail. Utilize vibration equipment to assess the condition of specific bearings, motors, spindles and rotating shafts. Perform an analysis of the fluids to look for abnormal wear or contamination that could drastically reduce the longevity of the equipment or lead to catastrophic failure of the process. Document results and plan/schedule repair work for non-conforming items. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Consider evaluating total equipment capability (quality and reliability) of constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;New business/products may stress the capability of your current equipment, so it is important to perform a complete Machine Health Assessment (MHA) to evaluate the capability and reliability of the equipment. The MHA typically results in a detailed report that gives you the raw data and provides recommendations regarding equipment repairs or improvements. The recommendations can be categorized as nuance, important and critical to allow informed decisions to be made as to which performance criteria will be addressed and to plan those activities to minimize cost and disruption to the operation. Making these improvements proactively, before production gets ramped up, can help you avoid producing poor or inconsistent quality products, wasting your effort on expensive rework or having late/missed shipments, all of which will disappoint your customers and could result in lost business.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate the critical spare replacement parts for your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you have a comprehensive list of critical spare replacement parts identified for each constraint and critical equipment? If not, it should be a high priority to develop them. Once you have them (making the assumption that you used a robust process to develop them), make sure each of the critical spare parts has a specific parts plan identified and documented. Vendor-managed inventory, consignment, repair vs. replace and other strategies may be appropriate and cost-effective ways to mitigate risk and minimize cost. Many companies and OEMs chose to reduce the inventory levels they maintained during the past year. As a result, parts may have longer lead times or, in some cases, the supplier may have gone out of business all together. Once the plan with appropriate stocking levels has been established, audit the maintenance parts crib and the system to confirm that inventory levels match the plan and the actual physical parts available are properly reflected in the system. This is extremely important if you haven&amp;rsquo;t maintained the discipline to sustain a proper cycle-counting program during the past year. Prioritize the items that are below planned levels, determine how you will replenish them and proactively procure the items needed to execute your plan. Poor identification, inaccurate information or a poor plan for spare parts can have a devastating effect on your ability to serve your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate the preventive maintenance (PM) tasks for your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you reduce, ignore, turn off or quit executing PMs for your constraint and critical equipment during the past year? What may have been or seemed like an adequate level during the past year probably isn&amp;rsquo;t well suited to sustain optimum performance as demand increases and capacity becomes constrained. Review the prior PM plans and evaluate how predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies might be revised or expanded to help mitigate risk and reduce unplanned breakdowns. A robust, well-executed PM plan can help reduce that risk and increase uptime.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Consider integrating your production operators into the maintenance plan for constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Operators that are properly trained and engaged in autonomous maintenance tasks to maintain the equipment can make a tremendous impact on reducing breakdowns and increasing productive uptime. The level of engagement will vary from company to company, but if the company is conducive to engaging the operators and the leadership has the discipline to implement the accountability required to sustain the process, you can positively affect machine performance, operator attitudes and free up valuable maintenance resources to concentrate on more complex, higher-value activities to drive additional performance enhancements throughout the operation. While it takes some time to identify, set up and train operators to properly perform the appropriate cleaning, inspection and lubrication tasks, the payback can be quite valuable. Do not assume that the operator knows or should know what they need to do. Invest the time to do it right and get the buy-in of the operators and their direct supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ensure maintenance technicians have the proper skills and training to maintain, troubleshoot, and repair your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Do your current maintenance technicians have the knowledge and skills to properly maintain, troubleshoot and repair your equipment? During the past year, many companies lost or laid off experienced maintenance technicians. Even if your company didn&amp;rsquo;t downsize your maintenance staff, you likely minimized or eliminated much of your training program or expenses. Now may be the right time to reinvest in training your current staff to ensure they can effectively handle issues that will arise as you increase your production throughput and stress the plant&amp;rsquo;s capacity. Review the controls, programmable logic controller (PLCs) and systems associated with your constraint and critical equipment. Create a skills matrix of your maintenance personnel. This matrix can be developed in a highly scientific method utilizing tests and proof-of-performance demonstrations or you can simply develop this matrix utilizing input from maintenance peers, maintenance leadership and internal operational customers of prior maintenance support. Develop specific training plans for each of the technicians that target the skills and abilities required to support the specific controls, PLC and systems that make up the constraint and critical equipment. You should also ensure that each is properly trained and capable to perform problem-solving and root cause analysis. Proper utilization of these tools will help transform the maintenance effort from constant firefighting to one where the root cause is determined and mitigated or eliminated from reoccurring in the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Review, establish and align metrics to monitor progress for constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;It is not uncommon for maintenance personnel to use broad, general, high-level information or data to assess their overall effectiveness or performance. Wherever possible, get the maintenance data to a level of granularity that it can be aligned with operational performance data and reconcile the maintenance data or metrics against the operation performance metrics on a frequent basis. Remember, maintenance is a support service with the goals of maximizing operational performance, equipment availability, equipment performance and equipment longevity in a cost-effective manner. Routinely reviewing specific operational performance in conjunction with the maintenance metrics for specific operational areas creates an effective partnership between your maintenance and operational personnel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Expand the approach to encompass the appropriate non-constraint and non-critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Once you have completed the nine steps above with a focus on the constraint and critical equipment, review the list of remaining assets or equipment, prioritize them into groups or subsequent phases and systematically implement the process on each group. You will need to determine whether it merits implementing this approach on every piece of your equipment or just to a certain level. Make sure you look for common groups of the same type of equipment within or between multiple plants. Take advantage of the effort spent on developing the comprehensive maintenance approach on one piece of equipment and implement it on all of them that you have within your enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Done poorly, maintenance can lead to unreliable assets breaking down at inopportune times. Done well, maintenance can be an enabler of a productive, quality-oriented profitable business. By investing in the people, the process and deploying the appropriate approach now, you can prepare and position your company to take advantage of the opportunities that materialize as the economy rebounds. There are no short cuts; you really do get out of it what you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/rIO5Rpu7IQ4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Azima DLI unveils enhanced machinery condition assessment software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, a leader and provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on April 5 announced a significant upgrade to its advanced machinery condition assessment software, ExpertALERT 3.40. Manufacturers now have the ability to improve plant performance by better prioritizing machine repairs while remaining focused on reliability and uptime priorities based on the ability to more rapidly collect and process data, and access accurate results through the Azima DLI WATCHMAN Reliability Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s automated solution provides plant managers with actionable, easy-to-understand fault diagnosis, fault severity and repair priority data for each machine they measure. ExpertALERT is an ideal solution for manufactures with significant workforce and budget restrictions because it provides timely information that is crucial to not only identifying critical machinery faults before they happen, but also for avoiding unnecessary maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ExpertALERT 3.40 includes a wide array of productivity and performance features including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Fifty percent faster data collection for DCX and DCA-60 data collectors: &lt;/strong&gt;The DCX and DCA-60 data collection has been optimized with the data collection time reduced from 37 seconds to only 19 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New User Defined Point Capabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;User-defined points (UDPs) may now be defined at the plant or area levels of the database hierarchy. UDPs allow external files of any type to be embedded in the ALERT database and referenced from the application software. By allowing UDPs at the plant or area level, reports covering groups of machines now have a home in the database tree. UDPs are now replicated between master and subscriber databases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Improved Accuracy of Bearing Fault Frequencies: &lt;/strong&gt;A new Bearing Database Update Tool lets users update the &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; bearings in an ExpertALERT database without affecting new bearings that have been entered. This update improves the accuracy of the fault frequencies of the bearings included with ExpertALERT.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Windows 7 Support: &lt;/strong&gt;ExpertALERT now supports the Windows 7 Operating System.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New &amp;ldquo;Quick Review&amp;rdquo; of expert system automated analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;Results that have not been reviewed can now be automatically screened based on severity level by selecting this option from the Expert menu.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;New Support for Single-Axis Sensors: &lt;/strong&gt;A new data collector option lets users change to single-axis mode to collect data in all three directions at a bearing with a single-axis sensor connected to Channel 1. When data collection is started, the system prompts the user to connect the sensor for each axis in turn and store the data appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ability to override sensitivity settings for triaxial accelerometers: &lt;/strong&gt;A new data collector option lets users specify sensitivity settings for all three axes of the accelerometer and override the single sensitivity setting specified in the database for this particular sensor location. This allows for more accurate data collection based on the actual calibration of the triaxial sensor. When this option is selected, additional fields appear so maintenance professionals can enter the model and serial number of the sensor and the sensitivity necessary (in mV/G) for each of the three channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s services and solutions are aimed at plants that recognize the direct correlation between ROI and performance,&amp;rdquo; said Jonathan Hakim, president, Azima DLI. &amp;ldquo;The urgency to cut operational costs has left many manufacturing companies with significant challenges in maintaining the performance of their condition monitoring program. The ExpertALERT solution provides companies with critical machinery health information that helps ensure optimal machinery performance and uptime while boosting employee productivity.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/ZfEk9O9Suow" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Poll finds challenges with PdM sustainability can overshadow successes </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Azima DLI, the leader and premier provider of predictive machine condition monitoring and analysis services, on April 1 announced the results of a survey aimed at gaining insight into the state of predictive maintenance and condition monitoring programs among U.S. plants. Overall findings show that while a majority (76 percent) of respondents is satisfied with current programs, more than half of those surveyed agree that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know exactly what solutions and tools are needed to maintain a successful program. Combined with insufficient staff, limited in-house expertise and poor training as the top factors negatively impacting results, plants must re-examine existing programs now in order to ensure sustainability and the ability to meet long-term productivity and reliability goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The findings of Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s inaugural &amp;ldquo;State of the Condition Monitoring Industry&amp;rdquo; report are based on a survey conducted among engineers and plant managers. Of those surveyed, 65 percent have a machine condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place. The top three components of those programs are vibration analysis/monitoring, lube oil analysis and thermography. Of those who don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a program in place, 16 percent plan to start one this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reaching the C-Suite&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While the majority of respondents agree that predictive maintenance programs directly impact the bottom line, when queried about barriers to success, difficulty demonstrating ROI was one of the top factors. This could be directly related to other issues such as insufficient staff and limited budget support, but nonetheless, ROI remains an important measure of program traction that resonates with the C-suite. Therefore, plants must adopt the right technology and partner services to enable managers to better capture and report the benefits of condition monitoring programs, focusing on metrics such as decreased downtime, improved productivity, and cost savings related to improved equipment health and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outsourcing Predicted to Rise&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For those with a condition monitoring/predictive maintenance program in place, just over half of the respondents use a combination of in-house and outsourced solutions. While only 8 percent currently outsourcing data collection and analysis, based on this survey, outsourcing may be on the rise. Of those handling programs in-house, 53 percent responded that they believe there are benefits to outsourcing the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In considering a partner for third-party support, the following factors were ranked, in order of importance, as most influential in making that decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analytical software and services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ability to speak with a customer service representative 24/7&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Advanced reporting capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Web-based or on-demand access to data analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;While the benefits of an effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance program are clear to plant personnel and management, many programs have been left on auto-pilot during tight economic times,&amp;rdquo; said Burt Hurlock, CEO, Azima DLI. &amp;ldquo;We believe one of the keys to long-term success is greater visibility among the C-suite regarding the quantifiable impact these programs can have on productivity and plants&amp;rsquo; ability to comply with important industry standards for reliability. For example, by investing in cost-effective data collection analysis capabilities, plants can make informed maintenance decisions and generate results in terms of cost-avoidance related to unscheduled downtime and unnecessary repairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Detecting material accumulation in equipment with infrared</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared technology is one of the most important tools that can be used in a successful predictive maintenance program. This technology is not just for finding abnormalities with electrical components and equipment based on elevated temperature; it can also find potential problems based on lower-than-normal temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The capabilities of an infrared imager are limited to the imagination of the thermographer. There are many potential problems that can be identified with infrared for which you may not be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Locating material buildup in baghouse hoppers, coke gas lines and flue gas ducts are a few instances where you are not looking for the hottest temperature, but instead, the coolest. As long as there is a differential in temperature between the buildup of material and the gas passing through the equipment, you should be able to visually see the material through the lens of the infrared camera. If the differential in temperature is small, avoid sunny days when the selected equipment is located outdoors to avoid errors in the temperature readings from reflections and solar gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken011.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The example above is a baghouse in a steel mill. It is collecting the emissions from a ladle refining unit. There is a 20-degree Fahrenheit differential temperature between (Sp1) purple (the material buildup) and (Sp2) white (the gas stream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solid materials&amp;rsquo; presence is quite noticeable as witnessed by the&amp;nbsp;lower temperature in the bottom section. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken012.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This example represents a large-diameter duct elbow transferring gas and metal&amp;nbsp;particulates from an EAF furnace to a baghouse. There is a 30-degree Fahrenheit temperature difference between (Sp1) purple (the material buildup) and (Sp2) white (the gas stream), demonstrating considerable accumulation of debris in the duct.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two examples clearly show that solid material is present in both. This not only restricts the air flow through the equipment and can affect production, it also adds considerable weight to the structure that it may not be designed to withstand.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Consistency plays critical role in Ash Grove reliability program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Broken equipment is a cement producer&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy, causing lost time, productivity and money. While many of these problems can be avoided through an effective predictive maintenance (PdM) program, operators are often hesitant to implement one due to the up-front and ongoing investment required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Ken Rone, vice president of manufacturing services at Ash Grove Cement, a PdM investment is well worth the costs, paying for itself every time equipment failure and downtime is avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building the foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Overland Park, Kan., Ash Grove Cement has nearly 9 million tons of cement capacity and is considered a leader in the U.S. cement industry. The company was founded more than 125 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove first started its corporate Maintenance Excellence Process (MEP) in 2000, establishing standardized PdM equipment and procedures at each of its 10 U.S. plants. What varied was the staffing and consistency of data reporting. Some locations relied on onsite technical personnel while others used third-party consultants for various levels of vibration analysis, infrared thermography and oil analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had a high-level, sophisticated program, but we identified vibration analysis as a weak link where we lacked consistency,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to bring in an independent third party with expertise in this area and began evaluating potential partners in August 2008. We were ready to go with Timken in early 2009.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken is a technical solutions provider focused on improving uptime in industrial equipment. By applying its extensive knowledge of metallurgy, tribology, engineering and data analysis, Timken engineers help to maximize reliability and energy efficiency in machines critical to plant operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re at our best when we can bring all our knowledge together to solve a problem,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Brooks, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;When we combine optimal bearing, sealing and lubrication technology with things like proper maintenance, condition monitoring and diagnostic analysis, we really start seeing better results in how our customers&amp;rsquo; equipment performs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ohio-based company also offers in-depth training and consulting services, working with customers to develop a program that suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken was the right choice for us because of their consulting experience,&amp;rdquo; said Rone. &amp;ldquo;Their evaluation devices also use the same technology platform as our existing PdM equipment, so we were already compatible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing a new baseline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One challenge Ash Grove had was consistently collecting baseline readings for vibration analysis levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s critical to establish baselines for trending purposes,&amp;rdquo; said Tod Cotter, project manager for Timken&amp;rsquo;s services group. &amp;ldquo;Once the baselines are in place, you have something to compare future readings to &amp;ndash; if the amplitude of the readings trend upward, that&amp;rsquo;s when a problem might be occurring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing this, Ash Grove asked Timken&amp;rsquo;s reliability experts to establish baseline vibration analysis readings and provide consistent, verifiable data for Criticality 1 and Criticality 2 equipment at each plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cotter collected the data and performed analysis on all machines of 1,000 horsepower or more. He then made recommendations for changes in maintenance scheduling and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Based on our findings, we provided an audit of what was good and bad at each location,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;Each plant had different equipment and operating parameters, but the process helped us identify existing best practices that could be shared among all the facilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the Ash Grove plants in Leamington, Utah, and Seattle stood out as having solid vibration analysis programs managed by a combination of in-house technicians and outside contractors. Their effective processes were highlighted in Timken&amp;rsquo;s recommendations and later incorporated into operations at other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding the collaboration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Impressed with Timken&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise and suggestions, Rone asked the company if it would be willing to help manage predictive maintenance activities at four Ash Grove plants having issues with their existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our approach is to establish a collaboration, not just come in and dictate what a company should do,&amp;rdquo; said Brooks. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re glad to work with Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s people &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; to come up with a custom plan that helps them keep their critical assets running.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan is working. In the first 10 months alone, Timken and Ash Grove discovered 10 instances in which equipment critical to plant operations was starting to fail. These discoveries enabled maintenance personnel to make repairs and replace damaged components before a problem could cause unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Avoiding breakdowns in major equipment such as kilns, crushers and fans has the potential to save Ash Grove millions of dollars. One &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; on a raw mill motor at the Leamington plant helped the company avoid approximately $350,000 in downtime costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another case, Timken helped Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s plant in Foreman, Ark., avoid an estimated 12 hours of downtime by analyzing data that indicated a fault in a ball mill&amp;rsquo;s fan gearbox. Removal of the gearbox bearing, which showed severe pitting damage, confirmed a problem. Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s maintenance personnel replaced the gearbox before it led to a total system shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove also has made the switch to Timken&amp;rsquo;s machine evaluator for data collection. The machine evaluator is a handheld instrument that combines sophisticated vibration analysis with shock-pulse monitoring to detect bearing damage and inadequate lubrication, as well as many other problems with mechanical and electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Shock-pulse works particularly well for monitoring conditions in slow-speed cement equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Cotter. &amp;ldquo;The machine evaluator has advanced diagnosis capabilities for detecting machine faults such as imbalance, misalignment and structural weaknesses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ash Grove maintenance personnel and onsite technicians also are receiving training on how to use the machine evaluator and integrate it into a comprehensive PdM program. Additional training related to maintenance and reliability is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rone said training was a differentiating factor that helped Ash Grove select Timken, and Timken&amp;rsquo;s willingness to share its technical knowledge has translated into real business value. He also believes that the most successful PdM programs are consistent and ongoing. For example, part of Ash Grove&amp;rsquo;s MEP strategy is to reconfirm its vibration analysis baselines annually, with the help of Timken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken has definitely helped us strengthen our PdM practices,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;With their onsite support and accurate data reporting, our own people have more confidence in their decision making. Right from the start, Timken demonstrated a level of technical know-how that is helping us achieve best-in-class results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Diagnostic technology helps nuclear plant avoid unplanned shutdown</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Wolf Creek Generating Station, Kansas&amp;rsquo; only nuclear power plant, recently used Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Fisher FIELDVUE digital valve controllers to extend the life of its critical control valves. This action avoided a potential unplanned shutdown that in a plant this size could cost up to $1 million per day in lost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating since 1985, the Wolf Creek plant produces electricity for more than 800,000 homes near Burlington, Kan. FIELDVUE DVC6000 Series instruments with Performance Diagnostic capabilities are used in combination with AMS ValveLink software to monitor critical valves in the plant&amp;rsquo;s feedwater system. The instruments and software provide online, real-time data about the valves&amp;rsquo; position and condition, including variables such as valve packing friction. This performance data is easily documented and trended over time, enabling plant operators to diagnose problems and to plan and prioritize valve maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This capability proved its value after operators noticed an accumulation of graphite dust on the packing flange of a feedwater regulator valve, which indicated a problem. Packing friction acts to stabilize the valve and keep its plug from vibrating or &amp;ldquo;chattering,&amp;rdquo; which can accelerate packing failure. Loss of friction on these critical service valves could lead to a plant trip or unscheduled shutdown at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance crew discussed how to keep the valve operating until the plant&amp;rsquo;s next scheduled outage for refueling, almost 18 months later. The team decided to inject leak sealant into the packing while the valve remained in service. The sealant would extend the life of the packing and enable the valve to continue operating. The injection process would require careful monitoring, however, because the sealant might also affect packing friction. Too little friction and the valve would continue to leak and chatter. Too much friction and the valve could lock up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Justin Keim, supervisor of engineering at Wolf Creek, said this on-line repair process would not have been possible without the FIELDVUE instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The FIELDVUE DVC6000 positioner&amp;rsquo;s accurate measurement and monitoring capabilities enabled us to maintain system stability while packing friction dropped from 500 pounds to zero during the sealant injection,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The FIELDVUE instrument&amp;rsquo;s fast response kept up with the changing friction load, in spite of the valve&amp;rsquo;s heavy chatter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keim said the team would not have attempted this project using the old pneumatic positioner that the digital valve controller replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;On-line valve diagnostics via FIELDVUE instruments enabled our personnel to document drive signal, valve position and packing friction levels throughout the injection process,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The valve remained in service the entire time, and we avoided a potentially costly plant shutdown.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He added that two other feedwater regulating valves with the same problem were subsequently repaired using the same method and diagnostic tools. The work helped the plant avoided a costly unplanned shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On a day last month, in the early morning hours, I embarked on the scheduled task of inspecting the miles of power lines that are strung throughout the chemical plant in Central Florida where I work as a reliability analyst. The task was simple. I was to perform an infrared and ultrasound inspection on the high-voltage power line connections, disconnects, fuses and transformers, as well as the electrical equipment and components, located in nine substations throughout the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I started on the southeast side of the plant and worked my way northwest toward the two steam turbine generators that were supplying several plants as well as the public power grid with an approximate combined load of 59 megawatts (MW) at 69 kilovolts (KV) that morning. I found several small problems working my way around, including a few high-voltage components with corona activity present that I observed and recorded with the ultrasound equipment as well as a faulty connection at a fuse clip on a high-voltage line supplying power to a processing plant that I observed and captured with an infrared camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then I saw something strange with my own eyes. Just two power poles away from the first turbine was a bright red line above my head. At approximately 5:30 a.m., I found myself in the dark, spinning in a circle, looking up, down and all around, visually trying to figure out where the reflection was coming from. Then it hit me! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reflection. I could visually see the 69 KV power line glowing bright red in the dark.&amp;nbsp;Stepping back away from the pole, I viewed it on the IR camera from what I felt was a relatively safe distance and angle, just in case the line decided to break and fall in my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ardekani001.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the center phase jumper, I observed a pretty apparent inaccurate temperature of approximately 312 degrees Fahrenheit. That reading was due to being out of my measurable field of view with a Delta T of 228&amp;deg;F and another anomaly that was not seen visually with an inaccurate temperature of approximately 137&amp;deg;F with a Delta T of 57&amp;deg;F on the lower phase. Undeterred by the inaccurate measurements, I still saved the image. At the time, I believed that the temperature of the center phase jumper must have been at least 800&amp;deg;F in order for it to produce the bright red glow that was visually present. I also snapped a visual picture in an attempt to capture an image of the line glowing in the dark. I immediately informed the production manager in charge of the turbines and escorted him to the pole so he could see for himself that it was glowing. After his visual conformation, he informed his superiors immediately of the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few hours of discovering the fault, plant reliability engineers, maintenance planners and the plant electrical superintendent had a plan in place to perform an unscheduled power outage and repair the connections immediately in an effort to avoid the additional cost that would be incurred if the plants were to shut down abruptly without any notice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The power line that was isolated was leaving one of the steam-driven turbines carrying a load of approximately 34 MW at 69 KV when the fault was discovered. It supplied power to the local power company&amp;rsquo;s grid as well as six different processing plants, administrative offices and one maintenance shop. All of them were shut down unscheduled but were given enough notice to reduce any additional cost of corrective measures that would have needed to take place had the plants gone down without the proper procedures and protocols being followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon shutdown, the high-voltage electricians discovered the connections on the jumper that had been glowing were so damaged that the entire line length had to be replaced from one pole to the other. The initial investigation indicated an improper compression connecter was used to splice the jumper to the line going to the next pole. The connector was sized for the gauge of wire used between the two poles; however, the jumper was of a smaller gauge, thus making a weak connection. This was headed for catastrophic failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The faults were reassessed the following morning after the proper corrective measures were taken. The Delta T on both faults was reduced to within 5&amp;deg;F under approximately the same load, ambient and surrounding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/2TPfbChmIpk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ULIS to give talk on advances in uncooled infrared detectors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ULIS, a leading infrared vision specialist making affordable uncooled thermal sensors for civilian and military applications, announced March 5 that it will give a presentation on the advances in uncooled infrared detectors at the SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing symposium, April 5-9, in Orlando, Fla. These devices, also called microbolometers, are paving the way for high-definition IR products (VGA and XGA &amp;ndash; video graphics arrays) and smaller, compact formats. SPIE is the international society advancing optronics and light-based research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing 2010 is one of the defense &amp;amp; security industry&amp;#39;s leading meetings for light-based applications, and brings together top researchers, scientists and engineers from the military, industry and academia. Programs cover the latest enabling technologies and applications in infrared, sensors, image analysis, and other systems and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are focusing on reducing the pixel pitch, enhancing the high spatial resolution and lowering the power consumption of our uncooled IR detectors. We and our customers believe that this turns the TEC-less 17-micron pixel size VGA array into a product well-adapted for high resolution and compact systems, such as portable cameras or systems for commercial and military applications,&amp;quot; said Jean-Luc Tissot technical director at ULIS. &amp;quot;Every year, this SPIE forum throws a spotlight on new ideas and knowledge and we are glad to be taking a lead part in this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As co-chair, Tissot will open the session on &amp;quot;Uncooled FPAs and Applications&amp;quot;. He will then go on to present &amp;quot;High performance uncooled amorphous silicon VGA IRFPA with 17-micron pixel-pitch&amp;quot;, a technical paper he co-authored with ULIS&amp;#39; research and development team. The paper takes a close look at the high electro-optical performances of this IRFPA (Infrared Focal Planar Array) and the rapid performance enhancements ULIS has achieved. Tissot will discuss the NETD trade-offs with wide thermal dynamic range, as well as the high uniformity characteristics and pixel operability that the company has accomplished through its thorough knowledge of amorphous silicon technology coupled with the ROIC (readout integrated circuit) design. Tissot says this technology node paves the way for high-end products, as well as compact smaller formats like 320 x 240 or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ULIS uses special semiconductor compound material, amorphous silicon, to make its microbolometers. Amorphous silicon enables the development of high performance technologies and has the advantage of being able to be mass-produced, since silicon manufacturing is well established as an industrial process.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the large volumes of microbolometers ULIS produces can lower the cost per unit and open up applications in market sectors where infrared cameras and system need to be more affordable, such as cameras for thermography, surveillance or enhanced night vision driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About ULIS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ULIS, a subsidiary of Sofradir, specializes in the design and manufacture of innovative, high-quality uncooled microbolometers for thermography, automotive, safety and military applications. It enables makers of infrared equipment to produce low-weight, low-power consumption and cost-effective infrared cameras in large volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/R3P2uvsUG1g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bearing repair, PdM program address downtime at Gallatin Steel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When your rolling mill equipment has an emergency, calling a vendor is like calling the paramedics. Timken recently helped bring Gallatin Steel, a flat-rolled carbon steel producer in Ghent, Ky., back to life after a period of downtime. The Gallatin site avoided further costly downtime in its rolling mill operations as the result of an emergency bearing repair and the installation of a predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gallatin Steel employees heard an unusual noise coming from a shaft on a rolling mill stand that was critical to the mill&amp;rsquo;s productivity. With assistance from an on-site Timken representative, the noise was identified as a broken bearing cage, which was the result of high speed and impact force upon a competing brand&amp;rsquo;s two-row tapered bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. On the floor of the Gallatin Steel mill in Ghent, Ky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing, which had been in service since the plant opened 11 years ago, was removed and inspected. The cage was welded in the six places where it had fractured, and the gearbox was re-assembled. Timken also corrected the bearing clearance and made several other modifications to minimize any wear patterns that could occur after the assembly was mounted back in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help Gallatin avoid future emergency repairs, Timken installed a StatusCheck condition monitoring device on the bearing to measure overall vibration. StatusCheck, a wireless system designed to detect and monitor excessive levels of vibration and temperature, now alerts Gallatin&amp;rsquo;s pulpit operator to vibration changes, indicating potential problems in the mill drive train. The results can then be evaluated with Timken&amp;rsquo;s on-site technical team and further diagnostic testing may be required to understand the severity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Timken is an integral part of our overall preventive and predictive maintenance programs and has played a very valuable role in helping us identify potential problems before they actually became problems,&amp;rdquo; says Don Daily, president of Gallatin Steel.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How a reliability engineer improves reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	International standards define reliability as the probability that a unit will perform its required functions, without failure for a specified time period when used under specified conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reliability of an asset is set in the design phase of that unit&amp;rsquo;s life. Of course, the production phase can introduce changes to the design reliability, normally reducing it. This is the delivered reliability. Then the asset must be installed, introducing the uncertainties of quality of workmanship and oversight. After installation, the power is applied and the asset is activated and operated, creating even more uncertainty as to the actual reliability on the shop floor. When the asset has a problem, the thoroughness and quality of the maintenance performed to restore it to its original state can also vary. All of these elements affect the achieved reliability of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To a large extent, the achieved reliability of an asset is controllable first, by the manufacturer (OEM), and then by the owner/end-user. When an asset is manufactured, reliability engineers participate in design efforts to guide the reliability (and maintainability) of new products. During production, the reliability engineers monitor the prototype and production testing, which they had a hand in designing, to monitor the delivered reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At installation, world-class companies routinely assign reliability engineers to the construction/installation team to help ensure that the asset is put into an operational status in the proper condition. Reliability engineers also work with the design team to develop the asset&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program. This would include bill of materials (BOM), operator maintenance plans, and the preventive and predictive maintenance guidelines that are passed on to the owner at commissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers at the owner/end-user organization also play an important role. In a world-class operation, reliability engineers accept the data input from the OEM. This information is installed into the end-user&amp;rsquo;s data files and provides the basis for the asset hierarchy, asset maintenance plan, initial spares procurement and required training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The end-user reliability engineers will have had a part in the procurement of the new asset from the original requirement for that asset. Typically, reliability engineers are generalists. Part of their function is to provide the purchasing department with the &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; requirements for new assets. These requirements include ensuring that the proper data is required that allows building the asset bill of materials and provides the necessary information for any predictive maintenance program envisioned for the asset. The requirements also will address the allowable unbalance in rotating equipment, allowable vibration levels, degree of alignment on coupled machines and quite possibly the lubricant to be used in common items such as motors, gearboxes, etc. The end-user reliability engineers also will play a large part in the commissioning process, including verification of all of the &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; requirements prior to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is all well and good if you are in a world-class operation. But, what if you are trying to get to world class and need to justify an investment in reliability engineering? How can you show that a reliability engineer adds value? Here are some of the ways a reliability engineer can improve your achieved asset reliability, saving your organization time and money. (Keep in mind that increasing asset utilization by only 1 percent can drive measurable bottom line improvement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Outside the Box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tangible benefits come from thinking outside of the usual comfort zone of the organization. Poor practices become ingrained and lead to &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it that way&amp;rdquo; attitudes. An example is in the expected service life of equipment. Buying purely on cost is seldom a good practice for equipment. In one meat plant, buying totally enclosed fan-cooled (TEFC) motors was the norm as they cost less than washdown-rated motors. Of course, the area required a daily washdown. Convincing management that three to six months service life was not the norm &amp;ndash; and that the plant could do better &amp;ndash; allowed a trial purchase of washdown-rated motors. Changing to washdown-rated motors increased the unit cost by approximately 20 percent. Many of those motors have exceeded 10 years service to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-examine Shutdown Practices&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;During an annual shutdown, I watched a crew change belts on a critical air-handler. I watched as the 5 D size belts were rolled on over a bar. I asked the obvious question of why that was being done. &amp;ldquo;You have to pre-stretch the belts or come back later and retension them,&amp;rdquo; I was told. Taking this information up to our HVAC lead, I asked him where this information had come from. He informed me that he had been taught the trade by his father, who was a master mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I did not doubt his explanation or his father&amp;rsquo;s skills, I asked when his father had done his apprenticeship. His father had been one of the very early HVAC specialists in the area and was trained before V-belts were strengthened with cording. Our belting vendor was brought in for a training session where myths about belts were discussed. Following that session, we changed our maintenance instructions to require loosening the motor, properly installing the belts and then setting the tension. Of course, this added about 15 percent more time to accomplish than the original, so how did this change affect reliability? By not damaging the belts during the installation, we changed the task from an annual one to a tri-annual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the Air Filter System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many facilities have stringent requirements for the quality and quantity of the inside air. Traditionally, this air quality required changing filters on a strict time basis to keep from overloading and possibly tearing the filter media. But most of these facilities also keep track of the differential pressure across the filter banks. Using readily available information on the loading and potential weakening of a filter bank allows the filters to be changed on a condition basis rather than strictly time. As an offshoot, many facilities find that the change interval is lengthened on the side of the building that is on the upwind side of normally prevailing winds. This also increased the achieved life of some filter elements, decreasing total cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the Effectiveness of Maintenance Tasks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Reliability engineers also can help reduce overtime. Many of the maintenance tasks that a workforce accomplishes are of dubious value. In one case, an analysis of existing preventive maintenance tasks found that fully 40 percent had no value or did not address valid failure modes for the system. Removing these tasks from the schedule freed up time to accomplish not only the preventive maintenance program but also more time to accomplish corrective tasks without the firefighting that normally occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a research facility, this was especially evident when the annual shutdown of a building started on Saturday at 6 a.m. and went until 6 p.m. that day, started up again at 6 a.m. on Sunday and was normally completed by 4 p.m. The first eight hours on Saturday was time and a half; the last four were double time. Sunday was double time and a half. The entire maintenance staff was required to be on board for this evolution. The following year, after an analysis of the shutdown maintenance requirements, the shutdown started at 4 a.m. for fire system (statutory) cleaning. The bulk of the maintenance force started at 7 a.m. and the job was done by 4 p.m. that day. Not only were there no adverse events from this work, there was a marked reduction in trouble calls on overhauled equipment in the two weeks following the evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Predictive Technologies to Find and Correct Energy Losses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One benefit of reliability engineering that is often overlooked is the potential to lower energy costs in a plant. Using predictive technologies allows plant personnel to find energy losses and correct them. These savings are over and above the &amp;ldquo;green initiative&amp;rdquo; savings through such items as lights, improved insulation, etc. One plant used airborne ultrasound to document air leaks that cost (electricity only) $33,000 annually. Additionally, one large air compressor was taken off line with a corresponding decrease in parts and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another plant used infrared to map an oven which was in need of repair or replacement but was not in the budget cycle. The detailed scans coupled with thermal calculations showed the oven was only 6 percent efficient. The visual proof convinced corporate to invest in a new oven that is showing more than 96 percent thermal efficiency. The decrease in natural gas usage has shortened the payback period significantly. Additional energy savings can come from using premium electric motors in the plant. For example, a 200-horsepower premium efficiency NEMA TEFC motor with electricity costs of $.06 per kilowatt hour will save more than $2,100 per year. It is not hard to see a long-term saving by using this type of motor; this should be factored into any repair or replace program for motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the benefits of the reliability engineering activities mentioned above, keep in mind that there are many additional benefits that may be hard to measure but are nevertheless important to the organization. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Correlation between increased reliability and safety: &lt;/strong&gt;Numerous studies have shown that plants with high reliability and excellent maintenance programs have a lower safety incident rate than those without such programs. It stands to reason that if operations are carried out in an efficient manner, there is less haste to complete actions and less risk of an injury by carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Correlation between reliability and quality: &lt;/strong&gt;It stands to reason that a process or batch line that runs without interruption is more likely to produce a consistent product than one that is subject to starts and stops during the production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Control of spare parts: &lt;/strong&gt;With an accurate asset hierarchy and bill of materials, it is easier to carry the right quantities of parts. Couple this with an accurate CMMS and economic order quantities can be fine tuned. Along with parts, a reliability engineer will scrub the lubricant list of a plant and look for opportunities to consolidate and standardize lubricants to decrease the total cost of ownership. This subject also has been detailed in various professional journals and can make an impact not only of carrying costs of supplies but also on energy usage and disposal costs of lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers are valuable members of a manufacturing organization&amp;rsquo;s team. Through their efforts to improve the reliability of processes and equipment, they consistently increase asset availability and use resources more efficiently. While some results are easy to quantify and others not so obvious, the value goes directly to the bottom line of the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/tbP1ItqYwH4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 steps to diagnose a soft foot condition on machinery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis can be used to determine if a soft foot condition exists on a machine that is running. If you cannot shut the machine down to check for soft foot, using the simple procedure outlined in this article will help determine if soft foot is your problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mount your accelerometer on the suspected soft foot.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the live monitoring mode of your vibration analyzer to monitor the 1x rotation speed vibration. Use enough resolution to distinguish the desired peak, but not so much that it requires long collection time between averages.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While monitoring the 1x vibration, loosen the mounting bolt to approximately hand-tight.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the vibration at 1x rotational speed reduces significantly in amplitude, it is very likely that you have a soft foot condition.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Retighten the mounting bolt and schedule the appropriate corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When corrections are not made to eliminate a soft foot condition, the foot will deflect when tightened. This will affect the alignment and the motor air gap, and can cause significant vibration at rotational speed. By loosening the foot while running, the force deflecting the foot is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/FubOLhqrgCQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Optimizing oil drain intervals using BN vs. AN</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Safely extending oil drain intervals by using fluid analysis to monitor oil condition and engine wear has always been a significant means for reducing a maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s consumable costs. But in today&amp;rsquo;s economic environment, it is becoming even more critical to achieve optimal drain intervals and, at the same time, minimize engine damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advanced oil formulations have allowed the industry to make great strides in extending drains. The CI-4 and CI-4 Plus oils used in diesel engines manufactured prior to 2007 had a significant impact. Although many felt this progress would be jeopardized by the CJ-4 oils that were later introduced with a lower starting base number (BN), better CJ-4 additive technology actually enabled many fleets to increase drain intervals even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While fluid analysis is the best way to safely determine an optimal drain interval, the appropriate testing should be done by a reputable laboratory that uses reliable testing methods and produces quality results you can trust. Laboratories that are ISO 17025 accredited are required to prove the accuracy of their results on an ongoing basis or risk losing their accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safely extending diesel engine drain intervals requires the following tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/elemental-analysis.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elemental analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/wear-metals.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear metals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/contaminant-metals.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contaminant metals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/additive-metals.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additive metals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/fuel-dilution.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel dilution percentage by gas chromatography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/soot.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soot percentage by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/viscosity.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viscosity at 100 degrees Celsius (ASTM D-445)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/water-by-crackle.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water by crackle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TBN ASTM D-4739&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.polarislabs1.com/test-explanations/oxidation.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidation/nitration by FTIR (infrared analysis)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past, standard practices for determining optimal drain intervals using fluid analysis have required testing the oil for TBN and TAN. The theory was that when new, an oil&amp;rsquo;s BN is high and its acid number (AN) is low, and the longer the oil is used, BN decreases while AN increases. The point at which they meet is the optimal time to change the oil. It is important to note that ASTM D-4739 should be used when testing the BN of used (in-service) oils as opposed to ASTM D-2896, which may be used when testing BN in new oils. ASTM D-4739 uses a weaker acid for titration than does ASTM D-2896 and, therefore, produces slightly lower BN results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historical test data shows the relationship between BN and AN to be quite consistent. AN just begins to increase when BN depletion reaches 50 percent. As the BN drops below 50 percent, AN begins increasing rapidly. So in reality, BN depletion can reach about 65 percent before it becomes necessary to change the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider a CJ-4 engine oil with a starting BN of 9.0. AN will hold steady at around 1.75 to 2.0 until BN depletes to around 5.5, at which point AN begins to increase. The two will meet at around 3.15 to 3.5. As a result, most laboratories do not require both a AN and a BN to make extended drain recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following table represents BN/AN test results across a fleet of more than 450 pick-up/delivery trucks. TAN remains fairly steady until the TBN depletes from 12 to about six. The two meet at between 50 and 65 percent depletion of the BN. The AN is significantly higher than the BN after the BN has reached 65 percent depletion, which indicates that the oil&amp;rsquo;s ability to neutralize acids has dropped significantly. The oil should be changed to prevent corrosive engine wear from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1. Determining Optimal Drain Intervals Using Acid Number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Monitoring BN, viscosity, oxidation and nitration simultaneously and changing both the oil and filters when contamination from dirt, coolant, fuel dilution or soot reaches critical alarm limits is ultimately the best way to determine optimal engine oil drain intervals regardless of the time on the oil.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Preventive maintenance vs. predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For some time, a considerable amount of confusion has existed over the appropriate way to inspect for the presence of a given failure mode. Should I perform some type of sensory inspection? Should I perform some type of quantitative inspection? Should I apply one or more condition-monitoring technologies? Should I apply some combination of these techniques to maximize the conditional probability of finding the defect? Essentially, how do I identify the presence of a defect in such a way as to maximize the amount of time my planning department has to effectively and efficiently develop the job procedures, order the parts, and schedule and complete the work before the conditional probability of failure becomes too high? An explanation of the types of inspections and how they complement one another goes a long way toward clarifying which ones are most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sensory inspections have long been considered the backbone of any good inspection program. It was believed that sending someone around often enough to inspect for problems with machinery would result in identifying defects in plenty of time to effectively mitigate unplanned downtime. The inspector would use sight, sound and touch to determine if anything had changed since the last inspection. Any change would be recorded, reported and investigated by a craftsperson on the next scheduled outage. While there is a tremendous amount of benefit to sending someone around to perform inspections, there are so many holes in this strategy that it should never be considered the backbone of the inspection program. Sensory inspections typically only identify the most obvious and drastic of problems. It is all but impossible for a sensory inspection to identify early, internal defects in machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enhanced sensory inspections fill that gray zone. They are both a sensory inspection and a quantitative measurement with condition-monitoring characteristics. These inspections utilize instruments like spot radiometers, strobe lights, handheld vibration pens and simple ultrasonic meters to detect defects further up the P-F curve. While these tools multiply the power of the human senses, they have their limit. These simple tools do allow for different failure modes to be detected, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t replace a comprehensive condition-monitoring program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantitative inspections can provide useful information when it comes to generating data for trending and determining the characteristic life of a failure mode. Quantitative inspections require someone to measure something. Very common quantitative inspections include measuring the temperature of a seal on a pump or measuring the backplate clearance on a pump impeller. These measurements provide data to the planner and engineer and help determine the need for further maintenance action. When designed properly, a quantitative inspection procedure details limits and typically expected measurements. Any inspection that requires someone to measure something should have the minimum, maximum and typical values, with conditional tasks defined for when the limits are exceeded. But a quantitative inspection performed at the proper inspection frequency rarely will have a measurement that exceeds the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring, also known as predictive maintenance (PdM), is the application of condition-based monitoring technologies, statistical process control or equipment performance for the purpose of early detection and elimination of equipment defects that could lead to unplanned downtime or unnecessary expenditures. And generally speaking, you must conduct this while the equipment is in normal operation, with little to no process interruption. The purpose of these tools (vibration analysis, infrared thermography, motor circuit analysis, etc.) is to find defects not possibly found through previously available inspections methods, specifically while the machine is in normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking advantage of the available technology lets you accurately assess the condition of parts and the presence of defects heretofore impossible to detect. An example of the advantage these tools have in the area of quantitative inspections or sensory inspections is the use of vibration analysis to determine the presence of a defect on a rolling element bearing. Previously, mechanics and millwrights relied on &amp;quot;lift checks&amp;quot; to determine the amount of clearance in a bearing. Unfortunately, this technique is only valid for bearing defects that resulted in the removal of material from the raceways of the bearing; this bearing would be pretty bad off to have thousandths of inches of play in it. Sub-surface fatigue is easily seen with vibration analysis and at this point in the failure propagation has resulted in no removal of material from the raceways. This is the most common example of the advantages of condition-monitoring technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, there are different types of defect inspection techniques that can be brought to bear on a machine, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. However, these techniques aren&amp;#39;t necessarily exact replacements for each other. Each determines the presence of the defect at different places along the P-F curve and, as a result, each gives the planning function different amounts of time to respond to the defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) can help you determine which inspection techniques should be applied, how often and with what degree of redundancy. Remember, the trick is to balance risk with rigor. How much risk you are willing to take with a given failure mode coupled with how much you are willing to pay for the inspection determines the appropriate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Case studies in data analysis through predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The case studies provided in this article are actual data analyzed by the author. The case studies representing vibration analysis will present examples and comparisons of bearing faults, unbalanced conditions and impact testing for natural frequencies. Each example will be represented as a spectrum and, in some cases, a timewave form which will provide evidence of a fault that is present in the particular segment of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil reports will also be presented to give conclusive evidence of a dirty oil condition, with the target ISO cleanliness level identified for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil cleanliness is critical in eliminating premature component failure and extending equipment life. It enables maintenance departments to work toward increasing uptime and machine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is represented by thermal images of equipment components with temperature variations. Even slight temperature variations can indicate a potential problem in a machine component. Trained personnel capable of interpreting thermal images are a valued commodity in the reliability maintenance arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motors are essential to the operations of an industrial manufacturing facility. There are primarily two potential failure modes that affect electric motors, bearing failure or electric winding failure. Each type of failure mode can be detected and predicted, enabling maintenance to plan and schedule removal of the motor to avoid unwanted downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric winding insulation breakdown can be detected by motor current analysis enabling&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; predictive maintenance personnel to predict the premature failure of a potential problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Data (Gear Mesh) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	All gear sets create a frequency component referred to as gear mesh. The fundamental gear-mesh frequency is equal to the number of gear teeth times the running speed of the shaft. In addition, all gear sets create a series of sidebands or modulations that are visible on both sides of the primary gear-mesh frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data shown in Figure 1 below represents a block of data collected on a planetary gearbox in a dimensional lumber operation. The frequency of interest is visible at 37,915.8 cycles per minute (CPM) with a harmonic of that frequency visible again at 75,831.6 CPM. The sidebands are clearly visible on either side of the frequency in question. The diagnostics of this problem were somewhat difficult to diagnose because of the complicity of the configuration of the gear unit. This particular unit was a planetary gear set, meaning that the input shaft (sun gear) has three gears that rotate or orbit around the sun gear, which in turn meshes with the outer ring gear. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all of the meshing of gears inside the gear box, identifying gear-mesh frequencies can be difficult. In Figure 1, the frequencies were identified and matched to the frequencies in the spectrum. Notice the impacting in the time waveform at the bottom of the example. This is a good indication of meshing teeth with defects on the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This type of pitting and spalling on the gear teeth is caused by contamination in the oil inside the unit. The pressures between the teeth when meshing with each other can reach 300,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Sand and dirt are much harder than metal; when pressed between the teeth of the gears, they cause indentions in the teeth, leading to spalling and pitting. After the problem was diagnosed, a report was generated and the unit was taken out of service. It was sent out to a repair shop, and after disassembly, it was found that all three planetary gear units had visible defects on the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img height="306" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_01.jpg" width="468" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="384" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_02.jpg" width="512" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Gear Mesh Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is just one example of the benefits of predictive maintenance technologies, in this case vibration analysis. If this problem had not been detected by vibration analysis, it would have continued to progress to the point of catastrophic failure. When defects form, the gear teeth continue to grind away the metal surface, putting metal into the gearbox and creating a domino effect.&lt;br /&gt;
	This problem could have also been detected with oil analysis. By taking an oil sample, one would have been able to detect the wear metals in the gearbox through analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corrective predictive maintenance procedures can reduce the certainty of catastrophic failure. Figure 2 shows the vibration data of a blower that is in need of balancing. Figure 3 shows the reduction of vibration after the balance job was completed. This is just another example of how predictive maintenance can change the condition of a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Figure 2, notice the high amplitude at 1X running speed of the blower. This is an indication of imbalance in the rotating element of the blower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="516" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_03.jpg" width="492" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Vibration Data from a Fan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	After completion of the balancing job shown in Figure 3, there was a drastic change in amplitude. The reduction of vibration will extend the equipment life and enable problem-free operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="431" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_04.jpg" width="528" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Vibration Trend Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Notice the trended data in Figure 3. After balancing the fan vibration, amplitude dropped well below the alarm levels set for the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diagnosing the problem is just the beginning in the predictive maintenance process. Once the problem has been detected, making sure that the problem does not repeat itself again in a few months or even a few years is the goal. One of the goals of a good analyst should be not only to detect failure modes but find the root cause of the problem and prevent it from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figures 1-3 examined gear-meshing problems and the data associated with them, as well as an imbalance condition in a blower. Figure 4 represents a bearing problem with an outer race defect. Notice the side bands around the outer race fault frequency? This is caused by modulation in the time waveform. If you look at the time waveform below the spectrum, you can see the amplitude modulation that is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, this type of modulation will represent the operating frequency of the rotating element of the machine in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="378" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_05.jpg" width="528" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Vibration Data from a Bad Bearing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Other information that is present on the data presented is the bearing type SKF 22222CC. This information is entered into the software to allow the software to label the fault frequencies within the spectrum. The software has a database that has more than 10,000 bearing fault frequencies calculated. This helps cut down on valuable time and makes the analyst&amp;rsquo;s job much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis can be a powerful diagnostic tool. Identifying bearing failures, gear problems, and imbalance and misalignment conditions are not the only positives this technology provides. Determining operating parameters such as potential resonance conditions pays big dividends when designing and determining operating speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The pressure to continue to speed up or change operating conditions will only increase with the highly competitive manufacturing facilities that we work in on a daily basis. The problem with changing speeds of a rotating machine is that at some point we venture into the natural frequencies of the structure or rotating element. When the operating speed of the rotating machine and the natural frequency become too close, a condition called resonance is excited. This will increase the amplitude of the machine by as much as 20 times and can cause it to shake itself apart. To determine the frequencies to stay away from when modifying or designing a machine, a test such as an impact test should be conducted. In Figure 5, an example of the results of an impact test is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="503" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_06.jpg" width="528" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Data Identifying the Natural Frequency of a Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data in Figure 5 represents a valid impact test. Trying to operate a rotating machine within 20 percent of 7,313.1 CPM will cause poor operating conditions and an unreliable machine throughout the life of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrared Thermography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Infrared thermography is a popular technology for predictive maintenance for obvious reasons. It is easy to see where the problem lies, and problems detected are somewhat easier to diagnose for the technician. National training and certification is still strongly recommended in order to become competent in analyzing thermography data. It is very important to consider ambient temperature when analyzing and trending collected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data in Figure 6 represents a motor control starter with a loose connection on the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; terminal lead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="254" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_07.jpg" width="408" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Infrared Data of Motor Starter, Taken by the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The temperature in the rectangle on the infrared image identifying the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; terminal has a maximum temperature of 172.8 degrees Fahrenheit. When connections become loose, they generate excessive heat. When this condition occurs, the wire will burn in two, causing the motor that is being controlled to single-phase. This condition will cause the electric motor to fail prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="276" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_08.jpg" width="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7. Image of Problem Area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 7 is a control photo taken to aid the electrical technician in identifying the problem area. Part of the predictive maintenance process is to develop a report that will make the repair technician&amp;rsquo;s job as easy as possible. The technicians that diagnose the problem are generally not the ones who make the repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The applications for infrared thermography are still being discovered and utilized. The benefits of infrared as a PdM tool are by far the most beneficial from a monetary standpoint for manufacturing facilities across the world. Figure 6 is an example of a low-voltage application. Infrared has no limits when it comes to detecting minute changes in temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 8 represents data taken on a high-voltage power line. A failure on this application would shut down the entire plant, costing millions of dollars. Luckily, it was caught by an infrared technician on a scheduled monthly inspection route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="280" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_09.jpg" width="444" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8. Infrared Data of a Loose Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The temperature on the line jack was recorded at 160.2 degrees Fahrenheit, more than twice the ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you can see from the examples of analyzed data, infrared thermography is an effective tool for predicting and preventing premature failure. When utilized to it fullest and combined with other PdM technologies, infrared thermography is a very beneficial technology to the condition base maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Figure 9 below, the ISO contaminant level is 22/21/17. This far exceeds the standard set for all operating equipment in most industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For each numerical increase in ISO contaminant level, the amount of contaminants in the oil doubles. If the standard is a 16/14/11, then the increase in contaminants in the oil for a 22/21/17 is 64 times dirtier than the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil analysis is a reliable predictive maintenance tool and is very effective in detecting contaminants in oil that are a result of ingressed dirt or internal wear debris generated by the effect of machine degradation and wear. An increase in contaminant levels accelerates the wear-out process of all components in industrial machine applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contaminants in oils can be prevented. Good filtration on the return side of hydraulic power units will help in taking out dirt and other ingressed particles. Usually 3-micron filtration with a 200 beta ratio is the standard set for most machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eliminating leaks and insuring that clean oil is used to refill any oil that may need replacing is another best practice that can help maintain oil cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img height="577" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_fore_10.jpg" width="504" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9. Oil Analysis Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor Current Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Motor current analysis is another PdM tool that has paid big dividends to manufacturing processes across the world. Predicting premature insulation breakdown in the windings of electric motors enables technicians to diagnose electrical problems before catastrophic failure. If you combine motor current analysis with infrared or vibration analysis, you can detect both electrical and mechanical failures of electric motors, drastically reducing the risk of unscheduled downtime. By instituting root cause failure analysis, one can then increase the reliability of a machine in a plant process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Figure 9, the data provided represents a humidifier recirculation fan motor on which the analyst had been conducting monthly routine data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10. Data Taken by the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data provided above shows a comparison from two readings; one is the baseline taken on September 7, 2005, and the other one taken July 27, 2006, indicating a breakdown in insulation is beginning to take place. Notice the increase in the percentage of resistance imbalance. This is a cause for alarm, and measures should be taken to schedule the motor to be removed from service and sent out to be reconditioned. This is just one of the examples of the benefits of motor current analysis in the PdM arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another contribution, like vibration analysis, is the ability to detect air gap anomalies. If unchecked, air gap problems between the rotor and the stator can cause rotor and stator rubs that can lead to catastrophic failure of the motor. This can occur even if all other indications show that a healthy rotor and stator exist. Air gap as a fault zone describes the measurable distance between the rotor and stator within the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The benefits of predictive technologies are evident in every example of data provided in this article. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if a maintenance department starts with vibration analysis, infrared thermography, oil analysis or motor current analysis. Each will provide monetary benefits to the bottom line if implemented with commitment and well-trained personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data provided illustrates how vibration analysis can detect gear meshing defects in power transmission units, bearing defects in rotating equipment, imbalance conditions in fans and the detection of natural frequencies of structures supporting rotating equipment. Each problem represented and diagnosed has proved to save thousands of dollars in repair cost and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data provided by thermal imaging shows how minute changes in temperature can be detected, enabling the analyst to head off a problem that would ensure eminent failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil analysis data provided has shown to identify contaminants in oil that can cause parts to wear out prematurely and reduce equipment life. Identifying wear particles in machine oil can detect bearing problems and gear problems that could otherwise go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor current analysis provides the analyst with the ability to diagnose insulation breakdown and predict failures that cannot be detected with other predictive equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a maintenance department can afford to employ two or more of these technologies, the process reliability goes up drastically. Overlapping data analysis by combining these technologies will aid in establishing an effective predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Survey seeks respondents on how to sustain reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ARC Advisory Group is undertaking a survey to better understand manufacturers&amp;rsquo; approach to reliability for the management of physical assets.&amp;nbsp;ARC hopes to better understand the organization&amp;rsquo;s objectives and strategy, what assessment tools have been implemented, and the improvements realized. In addition, it also hopes to understand an organization&amp;rsquo;s commitment to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers are facing a variety of challenges including a mass exodus of skilled labor and related knowledge base, operating with aging equipment, environmental, health and safety issues, mountains of data to process, and energy management concerns while simultaneously producing quality product. Reliability of operational assets is proving to be an effective tool where the benefits can be directly impact the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), predictive maintenance (PdM), Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and root cause analysis (RCA) are just some of the many techniques available that are designed to maximize productivity through improvement in maintenance and operations practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Should Participate in this Survey?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This survey is designed for, and should be taken by, end-users at the executive, management and plant level who are involved in the maintenance and operational aspects of an organization, and have knowledge about the business situation of their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If there is someone else in your organization that could also contribute, feel free to invite them to also take the survey. All answers are kept strictly confidential, and no company specific information or individual responses will be disclosed. Furthermore, ARC states that it does not disclose the fact that you participated in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits of Taking the Survey&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Respondents can view preliminary results immediately after they take the survey, and all will receive a free summary report after the research is completed. The survey is designed to take less than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey can be found at &lt;a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e2nh4lflg2xmlno8/start"&gt;Sustaining Reliability&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/uTTId7kiKvU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to identify, correct a resonance condition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many experts working in the field of vibration analysis will agree that resonance is a very common cause of excessive machine vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resonance is the result of an external force vibrating at the same frequency as the natural frequency of a system. Natural frequency is a characteristic of every machine, structure and even animals. Often, resonance can be confused with the natural frequency or critical frequency. If equipment is operating in a state of resonance, the vibration levels will be amplified significantly, which can cause equipment failure and plant downtime. It is, therefore, important that the running speed of equipment be out of the resonance range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to identify a resonance frequency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many techniques can be used to identify and/or confirm a high vibration level caused by a resonance frequency. It is very important to confirm a resonance phenomenon by at least two different types of tests before trying to correct it. We will look at a few techniques commonly used in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techniques used to confirm a resonance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Impact test:&lt;/strong&gt;One of the most commonly used methods for measuring a system&amp;rsquo;s natural frequency is to strike it with a mass and measure the response. This method is effective because the impact inputs a small amount of force in the equipment over a large frequency range. When performing this technique, it is important to try impacting different locations on the structure since all of a structure&amp;rsquo;s resonant frequencies will always be measurable by impacting at one location and measuring at the same location. Both drive point and transfer point measurements should be taken when attempting to identify machine resonances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This type of test must be performed with the equipment off. This way you can easily identify the natural frequencies of the equipment (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="282" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino001.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Impact Test, Equipment Off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Impact test using an instrumented hammer:&lt;/strong&gt;This test is basically the same as a regular impact test, except that an instrumented hammer is used to excite the system. This hammer, equipped with an accelerometer at one end, is used in tandem with the sensor used to measure the vibration. A two-channel vibration analyzer is needed, in which one channel is connected to the instrumented hammer and the other to the vibration sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using this technique, you can effectively measure the force induced to the system by the instrumented hammer and the response at different frequencies. When the phase shifts by 90 degrees, the frequency at which it occurs is a natural frequency (Figure 2). The advantage in using this method is that it allows you to monitor phase shifts and coherence. With this information, you can create operating deflection shapes to visualize the vibrating body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="450" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino002.jpg" width="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Impact Test with Force Hammer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coast down peak hold:&lt;/strong&gt;Another method used is to monitor the vibration level using a peak hold function, while shutting down the equipment, as performed normally. The vibration level should drop at a steady rate. If the vibration levels start rising at any time while the equipment is being shut down, the speed at which the amplitudes increase is a possible natural frequency (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="324" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino003.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Coast Down Peak Hold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coast down peak phase:&lt;/strong&gt;Like the coast down peak hold, this test is to be conducted while the equipment is being shut down. By installing a photo tack and a piece of reflective tape on the rotating shaft of the equipment, you can monitor the vibration and its phase. This will allow you to see the amplitude and phase shift at all running speeds of the equipment. If there is no resonance excited by the turning speed, the vibration levels should drop at a steady rate. If the vibration peaks at a certain speed and the phase shifts by 180 degrees, this indicates a natural frequency of the equipment or structure. The actual natural frequency is the frequency situated in the middle of the phase shift (90 degrees) (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="321" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino004.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Coast Down Peak Phase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formula for natural frequency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The natural frequency is the frequency of free vibration of a system, in which a system vibrates to dissipate its energy. The natural frequency (&amp;omega;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) of an equipment, expressed in radian per second, is a function of its stiffness (k) and its mass (m), as shown by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="72" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/pellegrino005.gif" width="100" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If any of these two parameters are altered, the natural frequency will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you modify a natural frequency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we want to modify the natural frequency of a body, we have to either change the stiffness or the mass. Increasing the mass or lowering the stiffness will lower the natural frequency while reducing mass or increasing stiffness will increase natural frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we operate critical equipment if we can&amp;rsquo;t change the natural frequency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we cannot change the stiffness or the mass of the equipment, two possible choices are offered to us. One easy solution is to change the operating speed of the equipment by 20 to 30 percent, but this is not usually an option. Another solution is to install a dynamic absorber on the equipment to significantly reduce the vibration levels of the equipment. The dynamic absorber is a spring-mass system that is installed in series with the resonant system to create an out-of-phase exciting force to effectively counteract the initial exciting force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resonance is probably one of the five common causes of excessive machine vibration. Identifying a resonance frequency effectively can be challenging. We need to positively identify the natural frequency by performing at least two different tests such as impact test, coast down peak hold, coast down peak phase or impact test using a force hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the resonance is confirmed, either change the mass or the stiffness of the equipment to change its natural frequency. If it cannot be accomplished try to change the operating speed of the equipment. If that fails, consider installing a dynamic absorber to counteract the initial exciting force.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Leveraging the power of IR cameras for condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared technology can detect subtle variations in motors, pumps, conveyors and other machine components. For decades, portable, infrared cameras have provided non-contact temperature measurement on a constantly expanding list of applications. Infrared technology provides real-time analysis of entire &amp;ldquo;scenes&amp;rdquo; allowing for quick and safe monitoring. Infrared technology is an accepted and credited maintenance technology generally considered to offer the best return on investment of predictive maintenance tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The numbers of infrared cameras in the field have increased dramatically over the last 10 years. Technology improvements have opened the doors to potential infrared users who never considered infrared cameras in the past due to cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an increasing base of infrared users and applications, the challenge is to leverage the technology effectively. Proper use of infrared technology requires an understanding of the components and the fundamentals of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Infrared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared energy is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and behaves similarly to visible light. It travels through space at the speed of light and can be reflected, refracted, absorbed and emitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="330" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis01.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which is longer in wavelength than light. Other types of electromagnetic radiation are X-rays, ultraviolet rays and visible light. Infrared detectors or systems are categorized by their wavelength. The unit of measurement is the micron. For example, a system that can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; from 8 to 12 microns is considered a longwave, infrared camera because it &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo; in the longer side of the infrared spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All objects emit infrared energy as a function of their temperature. This means all objects emit infrared radiation. Infrared energy is generated by the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules. The higher the temperature of an object, the more the motion and hence the more infrared energy emitted. The cameras do not see temperature, they detect thermal radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="332" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis02.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Petronas Towers&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E+T+R=1 &amp;ndash; Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No IR camera reads temperature directly. IR cameras read the IR energy coming from a target which includes: E emitted, T transmitted and R reflected energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we discussed earlier, all targets emit energy. The infrared radiation that is emitted by a target is dependent on two things: the absolute temperature of a body and the emissivity of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Emissivity &lt;/strong&gt;is a material property. It is the efficiency of the body as a radiator or emitter. In our world, emissivity might be defined as the ability of an object to absorb infrared energy. We calculate emissivity as a property set by a number from 0 to 1. 0 would be a perfect R, or reflector &amp;ndash; all energy that strikes the target with a 0 emissivity would bounce off of it. Any object with an emissivity of 1 would be a perfect absorber &amp;ndash; all energy that strikes the target with a 1 emissivity would be absorbed. Neither example exists in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to note the emissivity is not a set number. It is a material surface property and is affected by shape, viewing angle, wavelength and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reflectivity&lt;/strong&gt;,in our case, is infrared energy that bounces off our target. Reflectivity defines the energy on a target that was not emitted by the target itself. Often defined as Tref or Tamb in cameras, it is the temperature of incident radiation from the target&amp;rsquo;s surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Transmissivity &lt;/strong&gt;of a material is the percentage of infrared radiation that transmitted through it. For example, glass has poor transmissivity in the longwave, infrared spectrum. Thus, infrared camera manufacturers often use Germanium for their lenses. Germanium has almost perfect transmissivity in the longwave, infrared spectrum. When dealing with infrared systems, spec sheets, salespeople, users, etc., will often only address the issue of emissivity. However, emissivity is only one-third of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we are interested in temperature measurement, we must realize only the sum of an object&amp;rsquo;s emittance, transmittance and reflectivity will get us to the complete number 1 and, for our work here, an accurate temperature measurement.Remember, E+T+R =1 gives us our best chance for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spot size ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another important factor when considering measurement is spot size ratio. Spot size ratio is the ability of an infrared camera to measure an object from a given distance. Infrared systems have to average a certain number of pixels together to calculate an actual temperature. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="300" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis03.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cross hair, or Spot 1, in the above image has a circle in the middle. The circle represents the number of pixels that are averaged together to create a temperature reading. Any object we want to measure has to &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; inside this circle. If our target does not completely fill the circle, we know we will be finding average surrounding components, and, thus, temperatures around our target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spot size is usually represented as a ratio. For example, an infrared system with an approx. 20&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo; spot size ratio can measure a 1-inch object from 20 feet away. Remember, a spot size ratio is a ratio. As we move closer or further away from the target are spot size ratio will grow correspondingly smaller or larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pixel count and optics play a large part in determining the spot size ratio of an infrared system. For example, if we assume the same optics for three systems with different pixel counts, 160x120, 320x240, and 640x480, we will have significantly different spot size ratios. The larger the pixel count, the smaller or more densely packaged the pixels on the detector. The more pixels we can get on a smaller target, the better our spot size ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, below are three images saved by three different systems. The images were taken from the same distance with approximately the same optic configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="241" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis04.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="192" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis05.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="242" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/curtis06.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Notice the maximum temperature in scene results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	160x120 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 127 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	320x240 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 243 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	640x480 Infrared System &amp;ndash; 280 degrees F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As our spot size ratio increased, we are measuring a smaller and smaller point and, thus, measuring a more accurate hot spot. In fact, we can actually see an impending problem on the 640x480 image that we could not see in the other images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A telephoto optic improves the spot size ratio of an infrared camera by narrowing the field of view. By tightening the pixels into a narrower field of view, we can place more pixels on a target and improve our accuracy. For example, a spot size ratio of a 160x120 infrared system with a standard, 25 degree lens is approximately 10&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo;. If we use a telephoto, 12-degree lens in place of the 25-degree lens, our spot size ratio improves to 20&amp;rsquo;:1&amp;rdquo; despite the fact we are using the exact same camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, by using a narrow field of lens, we have doubled the amount of area we have to scan. An argument for higher resolution cameras is that we can often use standard lenses with wider field of views and still measure small components from distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Over-emphasizing Temperature Measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ever since the introduction of radiometric systems there has been a tendency to rely on temperature measurements as an indicator of component operability. NETA and others have generated &amp;ldquo;equipment severity ratings&amp;rdquo; based on temperature. Therefore, through training and subsequent research, infrared thermographers have become accustomed to providing temperature measurements in their reports. However, a large issue for &amp;ldquo;temperature measurement&amp;rdquo; is whether that measurement is meaningful or not. For example, let us consider a relatively small, apparent, Delta T between two battery studs. In our example, the temperature of the bad stud is 119 F, +/- 3F. Under most common severity guidelines, this would be classified as a minor problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The important information regarding this component is not necessarily the temperature but the electric current (load) running through it. The battery stud is hot due to high resistance. At the time of measurement, the battery was being trickle charged 60 milliamps (MA). The battery was rated for 200 amps. Ignoring the fact that the resistance and heat transfer will increase with temperature, a simple ration of the power dissipated at a load of 200 amps, the connection would dissipate about 11 million times the power it is in the images. This would cause a failure that we would have missed! The load (current) is one example of a crucial factor in electrical system analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Ignoring temperature measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since we have just discussed relying too much on temperature information, we should consider the inverse. What if we only relied on qualitative finding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, measurement of a hot conductor indicates a hot spot at the connection. Common methodology would indicate that the corrective action is to clean and tighten the connection. This may solve the connection problem but is the connection problem the whole story. Measurement tells us in this example that the conductor temperature is 115 degrees Celsius, at or above the temperature limit on the cable insulation. The insulation has degraded to the point where new conductors must be pulled to correct the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantitative thermography is essential when equipment temperature limits are approached. There are many other examples where quantitative measurements are required such as diagnosing steam traps, safety relief valves or determining corrective action priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common mistake: Misidentification of components&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The many hats that infrared thermographers have to wear include the hat that says &amp;ldquo;expert.&amp;rdquo; Whether you like it or not, you are considered the expert in whatever you are looking at with your IR camera. It is very tough for a non-electrical person to identify electrical components. There is no excuse for not correctly identifying components yet this is done every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sources for the correct identification of components include plant personnel such as mechanics, electricians, technicians as well as engineers, management, equipment operation manuals and the industry groups on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IR is an extremely useful predictive maintenance tool. By learning more about infrared properties and how infrared cameras operate, we can learn how to more effectively apply the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to manage a multi-technology condition monitoring program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Managing a multi-technology condition monitoring program at a large mining operation was a challenging task, especially when there has been a cultural shift required to integrate the ideas of condition monitoring into an already complex maintenance strategy. One of the major challenges included shifting the focus of an experienced maintenance crew from a run-to-failure mentality to a proactive mentality. Another major challenge was folding the new work practices into the current work flow model, one which didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of emphasis on backlogged maintenance items. Finally, coaching the supervision and management about why this is the right move proved to be one of the more difficult tasks of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now less than a year later, dramatic results are being realized. As the condition monitoring statistics trend in the right direction, maintenance costs are shifting sharply as well. Overtime has dropped, and unplanned downtime has decreased significantly. The best part is the workforce is becoming more and more focused on fixing problems rather than fixing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This paper will share some of the stories and many of the measures that made this shift possible. In addition, some of the software tools and work flow models that helped drive the measures and decision making processes will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine is a large, open-pit mining operation located 25 miles south of Lakeland, Fla. Four Corners is one of six mines belonging to The Mosaic Corporation, the world&amp;rsquo;s 13th-largest producer of phosphate fertilizer. The Four Corners Mine produces approximately 6.5 million tons of phosphate rock annually. The mine has three distinct areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dragline Operations: Electric draglines are used for mineral extraction. There are six draglines averaging 50 cubic yards each.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field Pumping System: 82 large 2,000-horsepower pumps are used to move the unprocessed phosphate rock (matrix) from the draglines to the float plant. This makes for nearly 70 miles of 20-inch and 22-inch pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Float Plant: The float plant includes numerous conveyors, vibrating screens, pumps and log washers that are all used to clean the phosphate rock and separate the debris and unwanted material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told there are 775 pieces of rotating equipment on the entire facility. There are 270 employees at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four Corners Mine, with 110 of them in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine embarked on the implementation of a multi-technology condition monitoring program in March 2005 and has seen some very dramatic changes take place since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand the Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were and still remain several large challenges to getting the process completely ironed out. Like any process that involves more than one person, the relationships between the people play a vital role in continued success. Each of the individuals has to develop a level of trust in the others and as a group they have to develop a unified sense of purpose. Finding and retaining qualified personnel is another large challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring personnel who want to work in a mining environment and have any experience at all are very difficult to come by. As everyone begins to work together on a daily basis attitudes and personalities start to play major roles in the group&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping all these technical people working and working together can prove to be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key challenges is developing an understanding of the process between the maintenance group and condition monitoring group. The maintenance people have to understand the condition monitoring process, and the condition monitoring people have to understand the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without each fully grasping the other&amp;rsquo;s process and where they themselves fit into the other process, any kind of forward momentum will be difficult to initiate. Finally, internal group politics can play a large role in extinguishing improvements in the overall process. If there are individuals who tend to not give credit where credit is due, hard feelings can develop. On the other hand, if the leaders of the change process are quick to hand out pats on the back and do it often, then everyone feels they are appreciated and tend to work even harder to advance the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desire to Succeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key role in the success of any process is a strong desire to succeed. That desire is easily seen at the Four Corners Mine. The maintenance manager is the catalyst that keeps the program rolling on a daily basis. The manager&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward condition monitoring as a part of the overall maintenance strategy is what keeps the rest of the maintenance department focused. Above the maintenance manager, in the corporate office, the desire for the program to succeed is seen as well. The benefits of the condition monitoring program have been folded into the overall financial strategy of the mining operations at the Mosaic operations of central Florida. The condition monitoring program is expected to produce results in the safety, costs and availability areas of the overall plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety measures have been affected by means of reduced overtime and call-out work. When crafts personnel are not called out as much at night to work on equipment that has failed during a scheduled production shift, the likelihood for injury has been reduced. When the precise nature of a problem has been identified prior to work commencing and the craftsmen don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend unnecessary time and effort looking for the problem, the likelihood for injury has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being able to identify problems and get them corrected long before additional damage happens to other components of a machine reduces the overall cost of the repair. All of these add up to reduced unplanned downtime which is increased machinery availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Technology vs. Asset Ranking Graph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multi-technology Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine decided early to employ as many condition monitoring technologies as they could to provide the highest likelihood of identifying the actual failure modes of the assets. Vibration analysis, contact ultrasonic emissions, oil analysis and mechanical infrared thermography were chosen to identify rotating machinery defects. Motor circuit analysis and electrical infrared thermography were chosen to identify the failure modes of the electric motors and the associated switchgear. See Figure 1 for the percentage of coverage by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Technology Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mosaic Company also decided early on that an investment in the best technology available would help ensure the best results. CSI 2130s were chosen as the vibration analysis platform. Mikron infrared cameras were chosen for the thermography effort. The UE Systems 10,000 was selected for contact and airborne ultrasonic analysis. And, the venerable PdMA MCE/Emax was selected as the motor circuit analyzer of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="342" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon02.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Integrated Condition Status Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web-based Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Web-based reporting platform is used to communicate the results of all condition monitoring technologies to Mosaic personnel. A Web-based reporting tool was selected for numerous reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It requires no software to be installed on customer&amp;rsquo;s computers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It can be accessed from any computer with access to the World Wide Web.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is not limited to any particular hardware or software platform for the different technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is easily expandable as other technologies are added or removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mosaic wants all levels of supervision to be involved in the identification and elimination of machinery faults. Consequently everyone has access to the software. Figure 2 shows an example of a report available in the software that summarizes all of the problems identified in a given area of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated Work Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A fully integrated work flow model would be defined as one where both the Mosaic personnel and the Allied Reliability personnel had equal ownership in getting the work identified and accomplished. Figure 3 shows the work flow model, which is color-coded to quickly identify who is responsible for which part of the process. It was decided that this integrated workflow would provide the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get Mosaic and Allied interacting on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure Mosaic personnel took ownership of certain portions of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technician can make clear recommendations not just alert the customer to the technical aspects of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interaction at the lowest level creates a learning process for both the technician and the craftsmen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The &amp;ldquo;Post Check&amp;rdquo; is the feedback loop for the maintenance repair process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Relationship between the technician, supervisor and mechanic &amp;hellip; crucial for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="307" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon03.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Four Corners &amp;ndash; Condition Monitoring Work Flow Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was agreed that workforce education was an important foundational element that would keep the process going. Four Corners continues to make a significant effort to educate all maintenance employees about P-F intervals (see Figure 4). In addition, technology familiarization was also a major topic. Making all of the front-line supervisors and craftsmen aware of the different condition monitoring technologies and how they worked was seen as a key component of gaining acceptance. The reliability engineers conduct monthly &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions where sandwiches are brought in and key program elements and/or technology demonstrations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="256" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon04.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. P-F Interval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a dedicated focus, it is very easy to lose sight of the goal. To ensure this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, Four Corners dedicated a good portion of the reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s time to overseeing the process. Their goal is to maintain maintenance engagement and awareness while at the same time measuring and benchmarking the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s results and success as well as Allied Reliability&amp;rsquo;s. Successes are purposely celebrated at weekly meetings and misses are clearly identified and root causes eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon05.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. MTBF &amp;ndash; Motor Failures (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The entire process must be inundated with an attitude of constant improvement, and at Four Corners, it is. The maintenance manager is always pushing for more and better results. The reliability engineers are always pushing for more detailed explanations of problems and more focus on eliminating root causes. In an effort to help maintain this focus, Allied Reliability provides Four Corners with a monthly report on numerous measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Red, Yellow and Green Condition Entries, both overall and by technology&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Condition Entries Implemented&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Work Orders Generated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Route Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average Time to Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title> PdM benefits overall maintenance strategy at Linde gas plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Linde Group is a leading gases and engineering company operating in more than 100 countries. With such large and widespread operations, it is no surprise that maintenance activities are well run and that the company is no stranger to advanced monitoring techniques and equipment. In the United States and the United Kingdom particularly, but also elsewhere in the world, online machine monitoring has been used for a number of years at Linde plants. And, at the company&amp;rsquo;s Shanghai headquarters, it has a large and impressive &amp;ldquo;remote operations center&amp;rdquo; where it monitors and tracks the process operations of all its major gas plants in China 24 hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But Henry Aung-Kyi, Linde reliability engineering manager for Greater China, also knows that the key to successful maintenance operations is the right balance of techniques, systems and methodologies. An experienced and knowledgeable engineer, Aung-Kyi is convinced of the value of highly sophisticated online monitoring for critical machinery. But for some of the equipment at his gas plants, this level of technology and cost is not needed for optimum management of his company&amp;rsquo;s resources. And he has, for a long time, believed in the value of predictive maintenance (PdM), even if there is a price to pay in terms of time to acquire the skills and train the workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many process and manufacturing plants operate preventive maintenance (PM) activities. PM activities are usually time-based, with machine adjustments and replacements parts being made on a routine basis without regard to the operational performance or condition of the major piece of equipment or its component parts. However, PdM is a condition-based approach that builds a picture of the anticipated condition of a component or piece of equipment based on trend data taken while the equipment is in service. Such data is mostly vibration analysis data, but can include lubricant analysis, temperature measurements, etc. Based on this trend data, and applying principles of statistical process control, an engineer can predict when it is the best time to carry out maintenance activity. This allows him or her to plan work when it is most cost effective with a full understanding of the relative performance loss at risk. Since most PdM actions are made while equipment is in service, there is minimal disruption to production and can result in substantial cost savings and higher equipment reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating into Linde&amp;rsquo;s High-Performance Organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When Linde Group acquired the BOC gases company in 2006, it embarked on a program of integrating its new assets in China into Linde&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;High-Performance Organization&amp;rdquo;. With Linde operations and maintenance being process driven, focusing on process optimization and continuous improvement, it was only natural for Aung-Kyi to assess the situation at each plant separately and develop a plan for improvement to the next level of technology. The long-term goal is to bring all maintenance activities at all plants to the same advanced level, and share information and knowledge for optimal benefit. But, that will take time due to differences in the existing experience at each plant and the required level of learning needed by the workforce at each plant.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	So, the Nanjing plant (a joint venture with Sinopec SPC) was the first plant selected for a pilot application of a PdM program. Before running the pilot application, Linde invited specialist companies, including local Chinese suppliers, to do some PdM service work at the Nanjing plant and propose a long-term program along with details of the services provided and the costs and anticipated benefits to Linde. After one year of trials and discussions with the competing vendors, Linde selected SKF to start up the PdM activity for its operations in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;A number of key points separated SKF from the other vendors,&amp;rdquo; Aung-Kyi said. &amp;ldquo;As well as providing excellent services in the actual monitoring of the plant, they showed their experience by identifying what equipment to monitor and went on to produce work recommendations that were far broader than the other vendors. Naturally, the local Chinese vendors had a price advantage, even though the SKF people are from the local SKF China organization. But from SKF, we got more than just a &amp;lsquo;condition report&amp;rsquo;. We got constructive feedback of a depth that local suppliers could not match and a feeling that they really knew the machinery under investigation and had as much desire as Linde to manage that equipment efficiently. That transmitted a huge amount of confidence to the local Linde engineers, which is really needed to get PdM understood and implemented properly. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough that I was satisfied with a particular vendor. What was really important was that the plant engineers in Nanjing wanted the vendor, and effectively it was joint decision between me and the actual Linde people receiving the service to select SKF.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consolidating and widening PdM in the China region&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There are now nine Linde plants in China running PdM programs. The SKF engineers make a visit every three months to the plants to take measurements and follow up with in-depth discussions and recommendations as necessary. All data is uploaded to a central Linde database where all plants can access, and benefit from, the historical trending data for the particular equipment being monitored, many of which are applied in more than one plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simon Chen is Linde&amp;rsquo;s condition-based monitoring specialist for Greater China, and he has many years of experience in condition monitoring applications on many kinds of rotational machinery (e.g., compressors, motors, gearboxes, fans, pumps, etc.). He oversees the internal coordination of knowledge transfer between the nine plants to ensure the company extracts the maximum benefits in the shortest time. During the process of delivering the service to these plants, Chen&amp;rsquo;s experience has assisted greatly to enable SKF reliability engineers to make effective condition-based maintenance monitoring to Linde. This is enhancing the overall quality of SKF service.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The main equipment being monitored is the high-speed compressors and ancillary equipment such as pumps and expansion machines. Readings are taken at positions on the compressor that indicate the condition of each of the compressor stages. This is important to the overall efficiency of the compressor. Using SKF&amp;rsquo;s portable data collector Microlog CMVA60 or CMXA70, measurements are routinely and easily collected without any disturbance to operations. Relevant data is also compared with that collected by the integrated distributed control system (DCS) in the compressor. The DCS data is needed to control and protect the production process. It measures flows, pressures, shaft vibrations, etc., so that very fast automatic decisions can be made depending on what is measured. Any strong deviations between the SKF data and the DCS data are then discussed to the point of deciding what corrective action is to be taken.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success and a growing cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Commenting on the situation now, Aung-Kyi said, &amp;ldquo;At the time that the pilot application was started, Linde had a lot of projects running, so the success of the pilot was very much in the &amp;lsquo;own hands&amp;rsquo; of the vendor company. They had to really work hard to inform, educate and train the local Linde engineers how to handle and assess their machine data in order to get the most understanding how to go further. The standards set by SKF were very high, also with respect to understanding the necessary safety standards, which was, and still is, a growing priority throughout Chinese process and manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Today the confidence in PdM routines and associated technology is beyond question in Linde. We have seen a gradual understanding that PdM is a very vital part of a maintenance strategy, especially because processes like our gas production are particularly suited to PdM. Machines and equipment normally run well for a very long time. Problems come later when the first signs of deteriorating performance are caused by wear, unbalance, misalignment, overheating, etc. By detecting these conditions early enough, we can monitor and run the machinery at optimal acceptable performance without risking catastrophic breakdown that would disrupt production and have huge downtime and cost consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We also got to benefit from the SKF global experience of doing maintenance assessments on many process plants, including those that use many of the different makes of compressors, motors, pumps, gearboxes, etc., used in our plants. Their global asset performance and maintenance database is accessible to their China colleagues and is a living repository of valuable information, being added to every day, that is almost impossible to acquire by client companies such as ours. We can look at SKF best practices for machinery operation and use that as a guide to what to expect from our existing and new machinery as we expand our business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/DL2xZWi7k2s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How does a PM program help eliminate component failures?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In answering the question posed in the headline, we must first define what PM stands for. According to Life Cycle Engineering&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Rx_Definitions_60.html"&gt;Rx Definitions&lt;/a&gt;, this could have one of many meanings. It could refer to periodic maintenance, planned maintenance, predictive maintenance (although normally abbreviated as PdM) and preventive maintenance. Despite the definition of each and how they differ, they all relate to asset care. A properly cared-for asset will net much higher utilization at a much lower total cost of ownership. This is accomplished by establishing a program that mitigates or eliminates failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Periodic maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the cyclical maintenance actions or component replacements carried out at known regular intervals. Usually intrusive, they are often based on repair history and regulated by current inspection results. Periodic maintenance includes inspecting, testing, partial dismantling, replacing consumables or complete equipment items, lubricating, cleaning, and other work short of overhaul or renovation. This usually requires equipment to be scheduled out of service and may be done at intermediate intervals, usually ranging from monthly to annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is, by virtue of cost, importance, extensive labor and materials required, etc., planned to ensure, when scheduled, that it can be completed with the least interruption to operations and the most efficient use of maintenance resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Predictive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the use of instruments and analysis to determine equipment condition in order to predict failure before it takes place so corrective maintenance can be done in a planned and scheduled fashion. Examples include vibration analysis, oil analysis, thermography, airborne ultrasonics, non-destructive testing (NDT), motor current signature analysis, trending of process parameters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Preventive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is time- or cycle-based actions performed to prevent system functional failure. This proactive maintenance type generally includes scheduled restoration and scheduled discard tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure proper asset care, we must first understand our asset&amp;rsquo;s place in the functional hierarchy and its criticality relating to production process or value stream. This will also yield our lowest maintainable component. We now have the linkage to work orders, bills of material and reliability analytics. Once this is established, we then must understand the risk of the failures related to this component to determine the type of analysis we will use for developing our control plan to mitigate or eliminate these failures. This may direct us to a traditional Reliability-Centered Maintenance approach, a simplified failure modes and effects analysis, to follow the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommended maintenance, or to take no action since the component does not warrant any maintenance strategy due to a low risk ranking. In the event a hidden failure mode is identified for a critical component, a redesign would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once predominant failure modes are identified, controls must be put in place in the form of tasks. The preventive maintenance tasks must then be developed in the Task or Asset Activity module of the enterprise asset management (EAM) system so that a work order can be generated, planned and scheduled. In order to be effective, this task must meet the following: 1) based on a predominant failure mode, 2) comprehensive, 3) organized, 4) repeatable, 5) value-added, 6) proper interval, and 7) valid duration. There also should be a method to identify the skill level and acceptance criteria necessary to accomplish the task. Finally, a business process must exist to provide feedback on the condition of the component, actual duration to accomplish, and reliability analytics in place to validate all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM centralization for significant energy savings</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;All facilities lose energy dollars through overheated electrical distribution systems and overloaded and misaligned rotating assets, as well as lose expensive compressed air and steam through leaking pipes/fittings. Couple this with the increasing pressures of global competition, a thinning workforce and budget constraints, and you have significant issues/opportunities. A remedy is to improve equipment reliability by fully leveraging predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper focuses on how the successful integration of standard PdM technologies along with centralized reporting can capture significant energy savings and simplify ROI calculations. By the way, any associated benefits of increased safety, reliability and enhanced facility capacity is purely coincidental.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Matching Knowledge and Information &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bailouts, barrels of oil at $150 per barrel, boom and bust of the housing markets, wars, elections, and the gloomy global economy have forced hard decisions for many. For example:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Rising fuel costs force airlines to get creative and pass the costs to flyers such as charging for food, leg room, checked luggage and even pulling wires to reduce weight.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Even one manâs trash is anotherâs treasure. For years, no one wanted sawdust. Now it is up to $50 per ton or $1,200 per truck. One may say âwe are being forced to get everything out of the pig except the squeal.â &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These types of external pressures are squeezing all corporate profits, sustainability goals and affecting maintenance organizations which are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;already thinly staffed with backlogs exceeding available hours; 
&lt;LI&gt;very reactionary; 
&lt;LI&gt;and relegated to keeping the existing systems as good as possible. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How will you get creative to save money and add back to the bottom line or protect whatever reliability team is still standing? This is difficult since many facility maintenance departments are caretakers of older equipment and systems which were not designed for energy conservation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs pretend you are making the big bucks with few headaches as the director of facilities at a large pharmaceutical company, overseeing a reliability program of 24,000 assets at 10 plants in the eastern United States. In the last six months, more than 3,000 positions have vanished and the buzz is that there are more layoffs coming, less overtime and a 15 percent cost reduction mandate across the board. Forget getting the capital for improvements; you are trying to keep your reliability program staffed and sustaining production. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Where are you going to find some money? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The good news is that in most cases, the energy savings can be found within your existing processes. Your organization has the knowledge to address the issues but may lack the information to pinpoint the cause and implement timely and cost-effective repairs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The great news is that you have a centralized enterprise asset management (EAM) system that will help mine and trend information that can identify systems with the highest probability of providing energy savings. You were told the information is there, so it time to start making this system pay off. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A quick search of the EAM platform shows that infrared thermography of your electrical systems has identified 793 temperature anomalies totaling 44,300 degrees Fahrenheit over OEM heat curves and a potential savings in the next year of $94,353.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=257 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-table-1.gif" width=450&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Just like a crime scene investigator, you have followed the clues to find the bad actors. Now that you have the information, applying your knowledge is easy and determines the direction and proactive strategies. Using a rule of thumb that 70 percent of electrical thermal issues are caused by loose connections, cross-referenced with your top 10 components (blue highlights), the list starts to become a little more manageable with 521 items worth $80,000 in savings (blue highlights). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Your plan of action is twofold. Issue work orders to critical systems with connection issues or the highest paybacks and establish a connecting torque program during the annual infrared inspections. Successfully eliminating these poor/loose connections items eliminates 30,000 degrees F in excessive temperatures (bright yellow highlights) and the associated fire and safety risks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you are lucky, you could pick up more savings by using the EAM platform to cross-tie the next bad actor cause category of internal flaws with components already being addressed or near these systems. You are confident since this energy-saving opportunity doesnât include motor systems, compressed air, steam, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Realities of Knowledge and Information Gaps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Most organizations are in some mode of not having perfect information, trying to add a technology and/or trying to build a critical mass of data that can be mined for asset/financial information which will get them a voice for more funding and support for reliability programs. If any of these fit your situation, the following steps and calculations can help guide you through typical facility systems, PdM technologies that can identify issues and basic energy-saving calculations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle7&gt;Step 1 â Build an Inventory of Your Assets&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It is crucial to gain a complete picture of all assets within a reliability program, or at least the equipment targeted in your pilot project. If you are very, very lucky, your computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) may have some or all of this information. Depending upon your resource strategy (i.e. all in-house, all outsourced to third parties or hybrid), the challenge is always having the resources/time to work through a mix of report types such as spreadsheets, PDFs, databases, Word documents, and proprietary software and the inconsistencies associated with each.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you are at the early stages, grab a simple facility layout drawing and notebook and start walking the facility to capture nameplate data. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle7&gt;Step 2 â Get the Energy Bill &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This step requires work with the energy manager to review two to three years of bills and energy patterns. If you donât have an energy manager, your utility suppliers can help explain the billing and any calculations. Using the following sample bill and formula, you are working toward some amount per kilowatt hour that can be applied to your calculations.&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=213 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-tab-2.gif" width=308&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=31 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-formula-6.gif" width=425&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle7&gt;Step 3 â Follow the Money to Prioritize Your Efforts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A simple prioritization approach is to divide the gas, electric and oil bills into two usage categories: by building type and use, and by equipment types which are common to a variety of process and applications (compressed air, pump and fan systems, etc.). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The challenge for most organizations is to determine which systems will provide the biggest payback based upon the specific technologies. The four following facility systems and ideal PdM technologies can help identify opportunities specific to your organization. Each organization has a different profile. For example, industrials have a higher number of motors; pharmaceuticals more HVAC loads; and commercial buildings more focus on the electrical, HVAC and roofing systems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Remember, you have a limited number of attempts to gain or keep support, so make sure you are focusing those items with the best probability of showing savings. The intent of this paper and the following examples is to provide basic calculations to establish a concept and âballpark figureâ for electrical and steam energy savings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Electrical Savings&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The key process is capturing power consumption measurements taken before and after placing a piece of three-phase equipment back into service. The two-step process is as follows:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. Power Calculations &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;1000 â takes the total watts and by dividing makes it kilowatts 
&lt;LI&gt;1.732 â square root of 3 for three-phase power; eliminate this number for single-phase systems. 
&lt;LI&gt;4.2 = average number of cfm/break horsepower (bhp); this is based on manufacturersâ equipment data &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. Annual Savings &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the kW is determined, a second formula is required to determine the annual savings: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Annual savings&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; = hours x kW x cost / kW &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Energy-saving Assumptions for Calculations: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Hours of operation = 8760 
&lt;LI&gt;Cost per kWh = $.08 
&lt;LI&gt;Equipment is fully loaded&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;Motor efficiency factor = .90&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;Power factor = .87&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;100-horsepower motor 
&lt;LI&gt;Average power requirement in kW per brake horsepower (bhp) to generate one bhp = 0.746 
&lt;LI&gt;Compressed air pressure = 100 PSIG &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Steam Calculations &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Steam calculation requirements go beyond the intent of this paper due to collecting numerous items such as boiler efficiency, loading, number of boilers, fuel cost per 1,000 BTUs, steam pressures, water treatment chemical costs, labor burden, etc. Depending upon the size of your facility, the boiler plant team will have the cost per 1,000 pounds of steam. The facility energy manager or the boiler manufacturer can help. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle6&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Opportunity #1: Electrical Distribution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Electricity and electrical distribution systems are the backbone of how we live and what drives most of our nationâs commercial progress. The issue at hand is that much of the nationâs electrical generation and distribution systems are more than 40 years old. Many have surpassed their designed life and are more susceptible with safety and supply variables. These power issues, such as the following, are often hidden and problematic to equipment:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Unstable utility supply / line surges 
&lt;LI&gt;Lightning strikes / transient voltage 
&lt;LI&gt;Unbalanced and overloaded transformer bank 
&lt;LI&gt;Short circuits 
&lt;LI&gt;Unidentified single-phase ground faults 
&lt;LI&gt;Faulty power factor correction equipment 
&lt;LI&gt;Expertise and staffing shortages &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These variables are often hidden but can manifest themselves as single-phasing, shorted windings, overheated transformer banks and partially tripped-over current protection. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Risk and Insurance Perspective &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Zurich Insurance Risk Engineering reports identify that 30 percent of all large fire losses are caused by electrical failures (includes all cases and unknown). The following graphic drills down to the component level and shows the percentage of electrical losses caused by lack of maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=266 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-graphics-1.gif" width=425&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now that we have an inventory road map, we can take a tour of all transformers, switch gear, disconnects, distribution panels and contactors, relays, breakers, etc. Infrared thermography captures thermal anomalies and variances in temperatures. It is ideal for capturing high-resistance, overloaded, phase imbalance and loose electrical connections that cause overheating and waste energy. Scan while equipment is under load and hit critical transformers/connections during high-temperature periods.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During your infrared survey, a 480-volt, three-phase breaker is found to be operating at a temperature of 171 degrees F. The measured ambient temperature is 73 degrees F. The breaker is rated at 100 amps, but the actual load is measured at 38 amps. The anomaly is determined to be a loose connection and requires cleaning and tightening to be returned to a precise state.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Numerous ways exist to calculate the cause/effects of the higher temperatures and energy being wasted (i.e. heat curves, amp draw differences and voltage drop). The following example uses the amp draw difference between pre- and post-repair amp readings. In this case, the amps before were 38 and amps after the successful repair were 35.5, with a resulting difference of 2.5 amps.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Potential annual savings by repairing the loose connection: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;kW = (480 volts x 2.5 x .87 x 1.732) / 1,000 = 10.84 &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= 8,760 x 11.21 x $0.08 &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;= $7,603.15 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle6&gt;Opportunity #2: Motor-Driven Systems &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In the U.S., motors -driven systems such as pumps, compressors and materials processors (grinders, mixers, crushers, sizers, etc.) consume an average of 63 percent of the electricity in the industrial sector.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=265 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-graphics-3.gif" width=210&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Graphic 3. Motor Systems Energy Use by Equipment Type&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Graphic 3 identifies how this segment is broken down by energy use, which can provide some prioritization of your energy efforts. There are many opportunities since many sites have to live with low-cost purchasing practices or older, less efficient motors, but there is room for improvement. For example, an older 100 HP motor with low efficiencies (Pre-EPAct of 1992) costs approximately $35,000 per year and $525,000 for 15 years in energy costs. A staggering 95 percent of this motorâs life cycle costs (LCC) is consumed by electrical costs, so reclaiming just a few efficiency points with PdM can add significant savings to your bottom line.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A key ingredient in motor life is the insulation system used in the motor. Aside from vibration, moisture, chemicals, voltage irregularities, dirt and other non-temperature related life-shortening items, the key to insulation and motor life is the maximum temperature that the insulation system experiences and the temperature capabilities of the system components. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Motors can have hundreds of electrical connections that can become loose or faulty. Motors are rated by class for their maximum operating temperature. Temperatures in excess of these maximum ratings will cause damage to insulation on the windings, greatly shorting the life of the motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Heat is probably the biggest insulation killer. For example, a rise in temperature of 50 degrees F (10 degrees Celsius) reduces insulation resistance and useful life by 50 percent. Using infrared thermography, your team scans motors, pumps and compressors looking for temperature changes/hot spots among motors, bearings, couplings, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IR Survey:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Your team identifies one phase/leg of a fully loaded, 100 hp motor as being 95 degrees F higher than the other two. A thorough investigation is required to determine the root cause such as voltage imbalance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Troubleshooting Scenario #1&lt;/STRONG&gt; â The hot leg was drawing 45 amps and the others are at 30 amps each. This 15-amp differential is wasting $5,045 annually. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Troubleshooting Scenario #2&lt;/STRONG&gt; â Troubleshooting identifies a voltage imbalance of 466, 458 and 445. A simple voltage balance formula helps us determine that the voltage unbalance is 2.5 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=30 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-formula-2.gif" width=325&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=75 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-tab-3.gif" width=325&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Table 3. Motor Efficiency Under Conditions of Voltage Unbalance&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use the following formula to calculate each of the motor costs at efficiencies of 93 percent and 94.4 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=37 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-formula-3.gif" width=375&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Subtract the two numbers to generate an annual savings of $832.98&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;by working to balance the voltages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle6&gt;Opportunity #3: Motor-Driven Compressed Air Systems &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Compressed air often viewed as the fifth utility, accounts for a significant percent of the energy consumption and can have efficiencies as low as 10 to 20 percent. This opportunity area involves the optimization of motor-driven compressed air systems by eliminating leaks to the atmosphere, reducing demand and run time on compressors. Ultrasound technology picks up sound waves above 20 kilohertz (kHz). This is beyond human hearing. The detector picks up ultrasounds and transposes them into an audible range for the operator who is using a headset device. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Compressed Air Survey:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Before you start your leak management program, it is recommended that you determine the best route use a drawing or a simple sketch of the compressed air system. Breaking the system down into inspection zones makes the process more manageable. Start at the compressor (i.e. air end) and work outward. Hang a tag at each leak and update your drawing. Be sure to record the decibel (dB) levels as this will help streamline the work order ranking process later. Also record the instrument used and the number of inches or feet away from the leak when identified. Take a picture of the location. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Look for and tag valves left open, rags over pipes to reduce noise on large leaks, unattended machines left on and blowing air. Check and repair drain traps and donât leave them cracked open. Check for defective tools and quick connects. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During the survey of your 100 PSIG system, you identify 20 problems equally split between 20 and 30 dB. Use the following shortened look-up decibel and air loss table and calculation to calculate the cfm losses at each decibel level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=91 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-tab-4.gif" width=300&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table 4:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; Example table of decibel (dB) and system pressures (PSIG) &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;IMG height=26 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-formula-1.gif" width=300&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These leaks are wasting $3,096 energy dollars annually. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle6&gt;Opportunity #4: Steam Trap Programs &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Within steam systems are two types of leaks â internal when a trap blows through and steam leaking to the atmosphere out of the pipe. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Traps are mechanical valves that return condensate back to the boiler for reuse. Failed traps either fail closed or open. A trap failed in the closed position not only reduces efficiency but prevents return of the condensed water vapor; this can sit and corrode pipe/components. A trap failed in the open position sends steam back to the condensate tank, preventing useful work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Steam can be a very expensive resource, ranging from $5 to $15 per 1,000 pounds of steam, which includes the boiler fuel costs, labor, water treatment, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rules of Thumb for Number of Traps Blowing Live Steam &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;50 percent if no steam trap survey or maintenance program 
&lt;LI&gt;25 percent with annual program 
&lt;LI&gt;12 percent with semi-annual program 
&lt;LI&gt;Even newer systems can have failed or failing traps as high as 30 percent within the first three to five years. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steam Trap Survey:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Since you have a wealth of PdM technologies and no capital dollars, your goal is to reduce failed traps to less than 5 percent and fix 75 percent of the piping leaks. During your steam trap survey, perform visual inspections and be on the lookout for the performance of discharge valves, rust/corrosion, hissing, etc. Use the same tagging and documenting technique explained in the compressed air section. Add up all of the losses; multiply the steam loss by hours of operation, steam cost (usually between $5 and $15 per 1,000 pounds) and by the number of failed traps and/or piping leaks. Some facilities can have 500 to 1,000 traps alone! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this example, ultrasound and thermography identify a failed trap blowing 300 PSI with a 3/16-inch orifice (see the following graphic for an example of how the dual technologies supported a final recommendation). Using the following look-up tables and calculations, you can find the amount of wasted steam and the financial impact.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;268 pounds of wasted steam per hour 
&lt;LI&gt;Average cost of $12 per 1,000 pounds of steam 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;$77.02 / day (24 hours) 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;$28,110.82 / year (8,760 hours) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=109 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_pdm-5.gif" width=450&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Table 5: Steam flow (pounds/hour) through orifices at specific steam pressures: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy has numerous steam system optimization resources, larger look-up tables and additional calculations supporting the tables. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=142 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_predictive-maintenance-g4.jpg" width=400&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Graphic 4: Trap blowing through, stuck in the open position. Decibel level on the &lt;BR&gt;steam trap was a constant 52 dB and normal expected level should be in the &lt;BR&gt;20 to 30 dB range when operating. Pressure at trap was 30 PSI.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Closing the Deal &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These examples are only scratching the surface as there are many more energy-saving opportunities with additional PdM technologies such as vibration monitoring/alignment strategies, motor circuit and motor current analysis, lube oil analysis/optimization, and aerial infrared surveys for roof moisture saturation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As mentioned earlier, most organizations have the knowledge but lack the information to make the right decisions in a timely manner. Once you have solid results, your goal is to provide simple communications that gain support for your reliability and energy-saving efforts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first recommendation is to have centralized information which is easily accessed, extracted and understood. This can be done in a simple spreadsheet or database or with off-the-shelf packages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Second, learn how to âblow your own hornâ to gain support for your initiatives by publishing a regular savings and energy report. Keep the message simple, be specific in your arguments and have documentation in order to put a scale to the benefits and costs. The message should be financially based and not too technical, with numerous discussions and calculations about gallons, kilowatts and amperages. The medium could be a few PowerPoint slides or a spreadsheet. Always have backup document and calculations that support the savings accumulate and trend the results. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to the energy wasted and now being saved moving forward, calculate the corporate financial benefit such as the cost of downtime avoided. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Good luck. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Vibration analyzer ensures bearing reliability in gearbox refurbishing</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Fifty years of ongoing development has given SKF a bearing vibration analyzer that can probe deep into rotating bearings while they are under load. Initially used as a production line tester, itâs now proving invaluable during the maintenance and refurbishment of gearboxes and other critical units in demanding applications such as aerospace.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF vibration testing equipment is released by Rolls-Royce for noise testing of bearings during gearbox servicing. Release became necessary when Rolls-Royce Deutschland decided to transfer service work on gearboxes for secondary power systems to the sub-contractor Vector Aerospace in Almondbank, Scotland. Overhaul of these gearboxes requires detailed inspection of more than 3,000 components, some of which require testing with special equipment. This includes the various types of rolling bearings used in the gearbox that require stringent noise and vibration testing and measurement of the radial and axial clearances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vector Aerospace selected SKF as the best suitable supplier of test equipment for the bearing tests, but before putting the equipment to use, it was necessary to run a release process with Rolls-Royce Deutschland. A detailed test and acceptance program was developed by Rolls-Royce Deutschland using reference and series bearings of different manufacturers to confirm the usability of the noise-test equipment after its installation at Vector Aerospace site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development of SKF vibration testing equipment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good first step toward solving any problem is to get the facts. Thatâs exactly what a group of senior engineers at SKF did in the early 1950s.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;SKF already had a proven reputation as a leading rolling bearings manufacturer. Its bearings were used successfully in countless applications all around the world. They were made from quality materials, using the most up-to-date production processes and carefully checked before packaging. So, what was the problem?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was said that collectively the group members knew everything there was to know about bearing materials, bearing design, bearing manufacturing and bearing applications. But still, the SKF engineers had a problem. They were concerned about the causes of failure that bearings from all manufacturers were exhibiting. Minute exterior examination of bearing components and bearing assemblies could only take them so far. They wanted more facts. They wanted to probe deep inside a bearing while it was rotating and while it was under loads similar to those it would experience in service.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Intuitively, they knew that vibrations caused by the rotating and flexible parts in a bearing caused noise and could be a source of wear and bearing damage. But they also felt that understanding the vibrations better could tell them even more â perhaps even tell them what caused the vibration in the first place and how to design and manufacture in order to reduce the vibrations and the corresponding wear. And so, SKF set off on a path to develop an understanding of vibration phenomena in bearings as well as a method of measuring vibrations and connecting this back to distinct causes, as specific as rolling element-induced vibration or damaged ring-induced vibration, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the mid-1950s, the group had successfully created its first vibration testing equipment for analyzing structure-borne noise and vibration in bearings. They went on to develop equipment that would reveal problems hidden within a bearing such as dirt particles, cage noise or form deviations in a component. Their search had revealed the factors that could lead to bearing failure and customer dissatisfaction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Early milestone&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Early versions of the equipment were introduced into production line testing, but the group continued to probe further until, in 1965, one member of the group, E. Yhland, reached a milestone in the understanding of the quasi-static problem of bearing vibration.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;His work became a contribution to establishing national standards such as AFBMA 13-1987 and DIN 5426 (draft). These standards define and specify the physical quantities to be measured and the test conditions to be applied. The equipment became of extreme importance for high-quality bearing production.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today, SKF equipment such as the MVH vibration tester is used to analyze precisely the structure-borne noise and vibration of deep-groove ball bearings, angular contact ball bearings, self-aligning ball bearings and spherical roller bearings. The MVH is also used as the SKF reference equipment for these measurements.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Operation of the MVH 90C/200C vibration tester is semi-automatic, so when a bearing is to be tested, the only things to be done by hand are: the loading of the bearing on the test spindle; the pressing of the two-handed start; and removal of the bearing after the test.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The extremely precise sliding bearing spindle drives the inner ring of the bearing at a constant set speed while loading is provided by an adjustable, pneumatic axial loading unit. When the automatic test cycle begins, the axial loading unit applies an axial load to the outer ring and moves the bearing against the testing spindle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A pickup is applied to the stationary outer ring of the bearing and any bearing noise is measured, analyzed and displayed. After a predetermined time, the axial loading unit returns to its rest position and the machine is ready for the next test cycle. Resetting for another type of bearing can be done quickly and simply.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tip of the pickup rests against the outer ring and converts the radial vibration of the bearing into an electrical signal that is proportional to the velocity of the pickup tip. When the signal is amplified and analyzed, the vibration level is measured in three frequency bands. The result identifies one or more of a possible number of defect types as well as detecting dirt particles, cage noise and form deviations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reducing costs and ensuring reliability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The great success of vibration measuring equipment in bearing refurbishment for the aerospace industry has lead to increasing interest from other areas of industry. There is also increasing awareness of the savings to be made from the reuse of bearings that have been tested and meet quality and reliability standards. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other examples of the vibration testerâs versatility are its use in manufacturing companies where the equipment can be used to inspect incoming components, and its use in research departments to support R&amp;amp;D activities or act as a test rig for gears, motors or steering units, etc. The equipment is equally useful for grease noise testing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continued development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although the bearing vibration analyzer has come a long way since the 1950s, its development continues at SKF, where the search is on for even more accurate measurements and analysis. At the present time, research is focusing on three interesting areas: the application of different sensor technologies; the use of a detailed noise map; and the introduction of an expert system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information on SKF vibration analyzers, visit &lt;A href="http://www.skf.com"&gt;www.skf.com&lt;/A&gt; . &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/predictive_maintenance/~4/GVQB1yAScjY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
