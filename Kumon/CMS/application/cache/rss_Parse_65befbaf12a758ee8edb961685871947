            <title>Develop Employees with a Kaizen Approach</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing organizations make every effort to build the finest products available with unsurpassed quality, reliability, performance and value. This ultimately earns the customers&amp;#39; trust and strengthens their loyalty to the brand. However, these four elements (unsurpassed quality, reliability, performance and value) can run considerably deeper. They must apply to the people as much as to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often manufacturing organizations engage in kaizen (change for the better) to eliminate waste, improve procedures, maximize flow and ultimately create value for the customer. Continuous improvement organizations also continually monitor their processes through time study and observation. They improve the inputs to the process to generate the desired output. This is all noble because processes can continuously be simplified to increase value. What is often overlooked is taking this recurrent observation and kaizen approach to the development of people. After all, people are an input to the stream as much as the tools and materials they use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations should consistently invest and develop people in continuous improvement to increase their performance, reliability, quality and value. Of course, this investment would mean that the training process and the progress of each individual are recurrently observed. Granted, this requires resources, time, commitment, conviction and faith.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Edward Deming once said, &amp;quot;The most important things cannot be measured.&amp;quot; What&amp;#39;s the benefit of spending money on training and development? You will never be able to measure it. Why did you do it? Because you believe it will pay off &amp;ndash; and it most certainly will. Increasing the overall human capital will produce what many organizations dream of, a truly sustainable continuous improvement culture. Over time, this program will not need as much recurrent observation due to the fact that the investment has created an intrinsic value in people. The culture actually becomes self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once people value continuous improvement and see the use and benefit of the tools and the mindset, they want it and have the desire to help others understand it. Employees will begin to train new recruits with these values and theories as well as discuss it on the floor with their leads, engineers, managers and supervisors. They soon come to the plant to think not just to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In tandem, the organization is developing its future leaders with the foundation of continuous improvement. Eventually, there will be passionate waste eliminators and creative problem solvers at every level of the organization. The leaders will also be passionate about creating future leaders and assisting in the development of their employees and colleagues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the manufacturing organization strengthens the customers&amp;#39; loyalty to the brand by delivering quality and value to them, the organization strengthens the employees&amp;#39; loyalty to the company by delivering value to them. This value is to kaizen, train and invest in the people. Increase their knowledge, abilities and opportunities through training, coaching and &amp;quot;learning by doing.&amp;quot; This is an investment in culture and will take time and commitment. In the end, it&amp;#39;s an investment that will yield results for years to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/Wr_LkgMwrA8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Notable Solutions Earns 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Notable Solutions Inc. (NSi) recently received a 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award in the data capture category for its work with Toyota Industries North America (TINA). The 17&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;annual awards program recognizes excellence and innovation in the application of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;NSi has helped Toyota Industries of North America to automate many of their manual processes, thereby eliminating many paper-based systems, streamlining operations and enabling various departments within their organization to more effectively participate in their business processes,&amp;quot; said Mike Morper, vice president of marketing at Notable Solutions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We are extremely pleased to be recognized for the work that we have done to help Toyota securely automate many of their business processes and create a more collaborative environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota selected NSi to better manage thousands of paper and electronic documents for the groups involved in the manufacturing and sales of Toyota lift trucks.&amp;nbsp;The solution included a simpler and less-paper intensive way to track shipments, manage dealer and customer invoices and simplify the import/export process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota embraced NSi&amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the delivery of both electronic and paper documents into the same business process workflows, regardless of whether the document originated at a user&amp;rsquo;s workstation or was scanned on one of the company&amp;#39;s multi-function devices (MFDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toyota is committed to the kaizen principle of continuous improvement, and NSi has given us the ability to significantly improve our business processes and a platform to easily extend the solution to other areas in the organization,&amp;quot; said Dale Colliver, TINA&amp;#39;s information technology manager. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been able to save time and money, significantly improve productivity and install more efficient procedures that are helping people make quicker and better-informed business decisions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>10 Keys for an Effective Lean Operation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my opinion and experience, there are 10 components or keys for an effective lean operation. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1)&amp;nbsp;Safety is not a slogan. It is acted upon and driven similar to quality and other key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2)&amp;nbsp;Productivity is improving 10 percent or more per year, quality metrics are improving at 25 percent or more per year, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measurements are utilized for continuous line improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3)&amp;nbsp;Visual controls are in place to help measure managing daily improvement (MDI). These would include things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quality cost delivery and service (QCDS) boards are in place and acted on daily.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Associates meet every day to review the previous day and current day.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Statistical process control (SPC) tracking is in place on key processes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Andon lights and abnormality response systems are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4)&amp;nbsp;Housekeeping is continuously improving, making sure there is a place for everything and ensuring everything is in its place with no useless clutter. Shadow boards are being used, and lines are painted on the floor for safety and as a prerequisite for standard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5)&amp;nbsp;Kaizen methodologies, the process of continuous process improvements, are linked to strategic objectives. Kaizen events are executed monthly to drive performance. Associates are involved and challenged. Resources are dedicated, and the company is utilizing a strong continuous improvement office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6)&amp;nbsp;Raw and in-process inventories, which are the amount of materials the plant needs for orders within five days, are moving toward a build-to-order focus. In short, you are building only what you need to fill daily orders. Create the flexibility to create any product, any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7)&amp;nbsp;Production schedule compliance, which is meeting the production schedule as planned, is at 95 percent or greater, and the customer service index (CSI), which measures if orders are complete and on time, is at 90 percent or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8)&amp;nbsp;Associates are provided at least 20 hours or more per year of off-the-floor or classroom training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9)&amp;nbsp;A production process is established for daily, weekly and monthly accountability. For example, this would include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Daily meetings to review the schedule, quality, cost and inventory&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Weekly financial accountability meetings&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Monthly scorecard reviews&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quarterly reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10)&amp;nbsp;The plant is always moving toward the next record in safety, productivity, quality and inventory levels. Associates are excited about creating a positive environment where people hold themselves accountable.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to be Successful with Standard Work</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies say they use standard work, but actually very few do, at least in the manner that leverages lean fully at the operational level. Instead, most firms use some form of work standards or work instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequently, plants trying to implement standard work within their lean efforts will do a kaizen event and, in the process of the event, develop and post a number of forms (standard work sheet, work combination sheet, etc.) at the new cell. This action is a helpful exercise for the event but does not really help with the performance and sustainability of standard work or the continual performance of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem is that while the operators may be referenced to the new forms (this is what you need to do) or even involved in the development of the forms (the new standard work) during the event, this is not the purpose of the standard work forms or standard work for that matter. The forms are only for management, not the operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where training within industry (TWI) comes in. The operators are not going to be able to perform the new standard work (even if they were involved in the development of the forms) to the level that it needs to be &amp;mdash; to maintain the necessary stability of the process. TWI&amp;rsquo;s job instruction tool is the source of training operators in order to properly and consistently perform to meet the standard. TWI&amp;rsquo;s job method is the source of continuous improvement needed to develop and implement improvements to the process day in and day out. Traditional methods of training will not cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of good standard work is a fundamental key to lean success, but unfortunately most companies do not go nearly far enough with their effort &amp;mdash; and, in most cases, are not even aware of this. If you want to be successful with standard work, there is no alternative other than TWI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/T7JE77KJuYI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Standard Work Drives Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you were to ask an operator or even some leaders what standard work meant to them, you might get responses such as &amp;ldquo;standard operating procedures,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;work instructions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;check sheets.&amp;rdquo; These are all legitimately correct answers. What you might not get is that standard work is the basis for driving all continuous improvement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash; Taiichi Ohno&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This statement is often ignored as companies work to improve their performance. The initial attempt to quickly resolve issues so that the team can see action being taken may result in the essential element of continuous improvement &amp;ndash; root cause analysis&amp;mdash;being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An important part of truly understanding the relationship of variables on a process comes from stabilizing the effects of changes made to improve it. Traditionally, one may view the lack of this understanding in Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/0cdf685b-e10d-47b7-b28b-180c1c0e4a10_standard work image 1.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The intent here is to quickly take care of issues by putting into action what we believe to be the fixes necessary to the process. This type of &amp;ldquo;fire-fighting&amp;rdquo; usually results in busy activities that may not be truly focused on the larger root causes apparent in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying standard work to the process and understanding the effect of the changes will allow better learning for the operators and leaders. The effect of this method is presented in Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/e5c86b23-bfab-4775-82bb-a2bc69c0fcad_standard work image 2.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 285px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The critical component in this effort is using tools such as a fishbone diagram or creating a Pareto chart to detail and quantify the issues. The diligence and discipline of executing this is necessary for acceptance and use in your discovery of root cause analysis. At times the activity may be painful to start, but the benefits in learning by all will certainly outweigh the costs and will be welcomed and expected by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to understand the important variables you wish to measure. As you stabilize and improve your process, you will understand the barriers that had traditionally kept you from meeting your expectations. Remember, as Taiichi Ohno pointed out, &amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/mmyotgJZJRE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Value of Autonomous Operator Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does autonomous operator maintenance mean? The &amp;ldquo;autonomous&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;me alone performing the maintenance tasks for which I am trained and qualified.&amp;rdquo; Is it something new? To those of us who knew cars before electronic ignition and computers, owning a car fostered a do-it-myself approach toward keeping it running. I always pumped my own gas, changed my oil and filters, and sometimes changed my belts. I could check the levels of fluids, read gauges and listen to the running engine for anomalies. Technology has given me diagnostic tools to at least identify engine problems. Prior to the industrial age, the operator set up, ran and maintained the equipment. The industrial revolution introduced specialists, and we redesigned the operator out of maintenance and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You say those are not operator duties? Why not? There are too many answers to that, which when really analyzed, cannot be supported. I cannot defend the indefensible. Rather than look at the &amp;ldquo;why nots,&amp;rdquo; how about looking at the &amp;ldquo;how can we make it happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The German Post developed new maintenance programs for several dozen new plants coming on line. For the preventive maintenance (PM) program, a condition-based computerized checklist would be mainly a column of step numbers and some performance annotations. The technician located the step number on the machine, and beside it were the instructions with pictures and adjustment limits. Essentially, it was a visual factory with the visuals in and on each machine. Operators were qualified to operate a machine based upon proper procedures, an ability to read performance indicators and maintain the material flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, the relationship grew between the operators and technicians to where operators could identify problems and, with the help of the techs, fix them. They also identified PM tasks that they could perform and did. All of this was done without management or operating procedures dictating them to do so. The operator and tech had joint ownership of the equipment. The visuals also helped the supervision to ascertain machine operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In several U.S. postal facilities, this happened in a similar fashion. It was not uncommon to see an operator crawling over a machine. However, when a &amp;ldquo;tie&amp;rdquo; showed up, things reverted quickly. Ties were people from outside the plant. What this did was free up the maintenance staff to work on continuous improvement and help monitor quality. How did management treat this? They indirectly facilitated it happening by providing guidance tied to several conditions, including safety of the employee and not to harm the equipment. Otherwise, they got out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How did this manifest itself in plant performance? It led to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved production and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced unscheduled absences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced grievances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cleaner plant floors and restrooms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors as coaches and resource providers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovations in maintenance programs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lower costs of performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Smiles at the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the late 1950s and 1960s, two terms came of age: work enrichment and work enlargement. These were used when discussing motivation and seen as ways to satisfy the higher needs of employees, as identified by Abraham Maslow. Today, they are considered to have the same meaning, which is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enlarging the work was applied to combining sequential horizontal tasks. Where there were four employees on an assembly, the work was redesigned for two, and some decision-making was incorporated into the work. It involved maybe building four models of the same unit, with the employee making decisions about parts and fit for the unique models from information for which he received training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enriching the work was a vertical enhancement. This involved W. Edwards Deming&amp;rsquo;s assignment of quality responsibility to the person doing the work, building a unit and then connecting it to a different unit using a different skill set, or a multi-skilled technician working on a hydraulic line on the wing of an airplane to allow him to open the skin, reroute electrical, fix the problem and close it all up. I ran into this at the American Airlines maintenance center in Tulsa, Okla., where the unions asked to be trained across craft lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both work enhancements are designed to give the employee some ownership and pride in a completed task where more than their brawn was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may want to consider how work was designed before the industrial age and assembly lines. What happened to the worker during the late 19th century and up to the mid-20th century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The role of Fredrick Taylor in his study of work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The tactics of the robber barons, which reduced the dignity of the worker to nil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The necessary role of the unions and the dignity of the individual&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Laws passed by our government that established rule of engagement for the adversarial relationship of unions and management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How that has affected our production, innovation and creativity into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in the late 1950s, real breakthroughs were made in the subject of motivation and improved dignity for the worker. Acceptance and implementation were (and still are) the issues due to the history of the industrial era mentioned above. Two Americans who had been rejected by their own country introduced redesign of work to the Japanese: Deming with his quality programs and Mary Parker Follet with the concept of the employee being a citizen of the company and what that means in the recognition of dignity and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This fit well into the Japanese concept of space or time. This redesign of the workplace was responsible for the manufacturing excellence after World War II. Deming got them out of the quality hole, and Mary set up the dignity citizenship of the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 1980s, the Japanese experience showed up in the U.S. with total productive maintenance, total quality management, self-directed teams, continuous improvement, kaizen, just-in-time and poka-yoke. All of that was built around the dignity of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that work and learning are integral requirements of our character. They satisfy a spiritual need. We were designed to work and to reap the benefits of accomplishing a task. We need accomplishments and challenges to keep us striving into the future. Work is only part of the life career. We should learn how to design and use it to enhance the other parts. I would hope that this is still a mantra for our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/71xZ9alEIAo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Improve Performance with a Storeroom Makeover</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever watched the TV show &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,&amp;rdquo; you may have gotten a little teary-eyed as the narrator tells the story of the family&amp;rsquo;s plight. Perhaps your eyes got a little misty again at the end of the show as the bus moves forward and everyone cheers when the family sees their new home filled with features they need to improve their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It would be understandable for managers or corporate leaders to get a little emotional when they realize the excess and waste in their maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) storeroom and operating practices. Reviewing the waste in a single storeroom can be chilling. If there are multiple storerooms, the investment and waste can be staggering. In a recent survey of Grainger Industrial Supply&amp;rsquo;s clients, respondents indicated that 73 percent of customers believe they have too much inventory, 87 percent see substantial cost-savings opportunities in their storeroom inventory &amp;ldquo;makeover&amp;rdquo; and 71 percent say they need to improve inventory management in their current storeroom operation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unlike the team on the &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover&amp;rdquo; show, we can&amp;rsquo;t just bulldoze the entire storeroom and start over. Many times the storeroom is the original facility that was put in place when the plant was built, including the original shelving and old pallet racks. Material handling equipment and storage systems have evolved many times through the years as have the inventory-management tools &amp;ndash; tools that provide real-time reports on inventory and part availability. Before material resource planning (MRP), barcoding options, radio frequency identification (RFID) capabilities and other computerized inventory-management systems, parts were tracked with data punch cards and microfiche viewers. Thankfully, data punch cards and microfiche viewers have gone the way of the typewriter, but we are still facing many of the same issues we faced before we had all these sophisticated tools.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Before a storeroom makeover can begin, we need to identify a starting point. A gap analysis assessment provides a snapshot of the current state of stores operation and identifies barriers and behaviors that are causing issues. As we analyze the data from the gap assessment, it becomes apparent that the barriers and behaviors we identified as problems are actually work-around solutions the floor-level employees have developed to compensate for undocumented or poorly designed work processes and undocumented changes to operating equipment. When the basic business processes for storeroom operation are abandoned, other areas of management begin to be ignored. Soon a storeroom can become dirty and accumulate materials stacked in the aisles, safety hazards created by improper storage practices, unmanaged obsolete inventory and inventory in excess of the maximum stocking level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementing a series of storeroom Kaizen projects based on the 5-S visual management system is a good starting point. Cleaning up the storeroom to identify what needs to stay and what needs to go will increase employee safety awareness and provide the shelf space needed to organize the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/a34ca377-86d2-453f-b2d9-496257c816c9_image 1.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 225px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;These photos show a Kaizen project that eliminated several safety hazards and increased storage efficiency through a small investment in new pallet racks and time for the storeroom employees to relocate the inventory in a more effective commodity grouping of items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adopting a practice of commodity grouping of the MRO inventory has several advantages over grouping of inventory by equipment asset. Commodity grouping of inventory items locates all bearings, motors and other like items together. The storeroom practice of grouping inventory items by equipment asset is a practice that was common before warehouse-management software was available to track inventory electronically. Unfortunately, this practice is still a common method of locating inventory in many MRO storerooms. The advantage of grouping spare parts inventories by equipment asset allowed the storeroom and maintenance employees to narrow their search to a specific area of the warehouse when they were searching for spare parts. The problem with asset grouping of spare parts is that it leads to duplicate inventory. If a bearing has several applications throughout the site, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that the bearing will be stocked in each equipment asset location.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Commodity grouping of the MRO inventory has a couple of obvious advantages. The greatest advantage of adopting commodity grouping of the MRO inventory is a reduction in inventory investment through elimination of duplicated inventory. A second benefit of commodity grouping of inventory is increased employee efficiency while stocking and picking inventory orders. Commodity grouping of inventory also allows for efficient execution of scheduled preventive maintenance (PM) for motors, large bearings, gearboxes and other items needing a prescribed care program while in the storeroom inventory.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When redesigning a storeroom, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider how available space is used to store inventory items. Many times storeroom managers feel they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough space to house all the inventory the site requires. Utilizing vertical space is the most overlooked option when the MRO storeroom is laid out. Understanding the volume of space available is critical to using all available space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When assessing space utilization in the storeroom, look at the spacing of pallet rack shelving and for opportunities to employ a rack system that incorporates hanging storage for hoses and items that can be stored vertically. Most of the time pallet racks are set on a standard spacing throughout the storeroom, which leads to wasted space in the majority of the pallet rack locations. High-density storage cabinets use existing space more effectively than the old metal shelving seen in many storerooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a general rule, installing high-density storage cabinets can reduce the footprint of metal shelving by 50 to 60 percent. Not only do you gain higher utilization of floor space and staff, but these cabinets also provide better protection from dust, dirt and exposure to other environmental contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/9bf73299-f1ab-408b-adb1-7fff6ea6008f_image 2.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 246px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;These before and after photos are of an area where high-density storage cabinets were used to eliminate wasted space and increase the protection of stored parts from environmental exposure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we get the new high-density storage cabinets, new pallet racks, new desks and chairs, we need to address the more daunting problem of having the right parts available when they are requested. As we dig into the root cause of the problem, we discover that the storeroom isn&amp;rsquo;t always the cause of not having the right part available for the needed equipment repair. Common issues faced by MRO storerooms today include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Out-of-date equipment bills of material (EBOM)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Critical and insurance spare parts not identified&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Undocumented work processes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High levels of obsolete inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High levels of excess inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storeroom is not secured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Undocumented inventory-management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High incidence of expedited purchases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Buying from non-certified suppliers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A reactive maintenance culture that bypasses the storeroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are only a few of the issues that create waste in a storeroom operation. The two main areas that can be addressed by the storeroom are the undocumented work processes and inventory-management processes. For a total storeroom makeover to be successful, there are about a dozen best-practice work processes that need to be developed, implemented and executed. Each of these processes needs to be developed and owned by the storeroom staff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Receiving process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incoming inspection process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory put-away process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory issue process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Minimum/maximum reorder point process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess inventory identification process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obsolete inventory identification process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Return to inventory process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Return to supplier process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add/revise/delete process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planned work kitting process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repairable spares process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establishing a prescribed way to perform each of the storeroom tasks removes variation in the work process and defines the responsible person who will perform each step. When developing work processes, it is important to streamline the activity to remove waste and mitigate bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the storeroom work processes are developed and implemented, it becomes clear that there are several touch points or hand-offs to other work processes within the business functions. The storeroom needs to establish documented partnerships and scheduled audits of the processes to ensure compliance. Partnerships between business units define expectations and delivered results to prevent waste in other areas of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a department partnership is an agreement between the storeroom and maintenance department that outlines the expectations of the storeroom to supply the needed repair parts and the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s understanding of its responsibility to the storeroom to support their efforts to meet these expectations. If each area of the business is operating as an island or a silo, it is difficult to identify issues that are creating waste in those business units. The result is a reactive business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conducting audits of the storeroom work processes identifies areas that are not being followed. As these areas of non-compliance in the work processes are identified, solutions to mitigate them can be implemented and the work processes revised to reflect the changes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just like the data entered in a computer, if the initial receiving process isn&amp;rsquo;t performed properly, getting the invoice paid on time and being able to find the part when it is requested is going to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first stop of a shipment upon entering a business is the receiving dock. Parcel shipments and palletized shipments are delivered by various carriers and require different types of equipment for unloading. Regardless of the means of delivery, the items should follow the same material flow through the receiving area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure a real-time inventory system, items need to be processed through the receiving process within 24 hours. To accomplish the expected flow of material through the receiving department, the area&amp;nbsp;should be organized and have a defined flow of material from staging area to staging area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using an inventory barcode system is an ideal way to remove several levels of waste in the receiving process and aid in the efficient management of the MRO inventory. Barcoding the inventory also tracks any movements of the inventory to ensure the location of the part is always current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/28/b2cecfb5-6721-4b5d-a579-114fc5b84034_image 3.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 255px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;This photo shows a receiving area that has undergone an extreme makeover. A little paint and a small investment in new equipment made this area a functional and ergonomically friendly workstation for the employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the item is entered into the warehouse inventory-management system, it should be managed to ensure it&amp;nbsp;is maintained in a service-ready condition. A repair part that is damaged due to poor storage practices or exposure to extreme environmental conditions doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same service life as an item that has been properly stored and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A defined cycle-count process is required to ensure the right parts are available when requested. The best-practice cycle-count process involves classifying inventory items by criticality and usage. Items identified as critical or insurance spares should be counted on a quarterly basis with the expectation that these items are 100-percent accurate all of the time. Items with high usage are the bulk of the inventory turns ratio and should be counted every six calendar months. High-usage items should have an expected cycle-count accuracy of 95 percent and compose about 80 percent of the total inventory value. Low-dollar items like nuts and bolts should be counted annually. Their expected accuracy level should be 90 percent. These low-dollar items are prime candidates for vendor-managed inventory where the items are in free-issue bins in the maintenance shops or close to the point of end use.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To monitor the performance of the storeroom and define a strategy to improve performance, the storeroom manager must have a set of key performance indicators that shows trends and deficiencies in the current performance. A matrix of key performance indicators that monitor both storeroom and storeroom employee performance would include the following set of metrics:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Storeroom Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Turns Ratio &amp;ndash; The best-practice MRO inventory turns ratio is three to four turns annually&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Value &amp;ndash; Best practice is 0.5 to 0.75 percent of the asset replacement value&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Issued &amp;ndash; Dollar value of inventory issued&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Received &amp;ndash; Dollar value of inventory received&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Transactions &amp;ndash; Indicates the utilization of storeroom employees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incidence of Inventory Stock Outs &amp;ndash; Best practice is less than 2 percent of total inventory requests&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identified Obsolete Inventory &amp;ndash; Expressed in dollars, the best practice is less than 5 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess Inventory &amp;ndash; Items over the maximum stocking level, expressed in dollars&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Accuracy &amp;ndash; Best practice is 95 percent overall inventory accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory Adjustments &amp;ndash; From inventory cycle-count activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An extreme storeroom makeover is more of a journey than a one-time event. Many businesses spend thousands of dollars to make improvements to their storeroom, and then two to three years later they slide back into the old way of doing business. When this happens, the frustration level of management and employees can be even higher than before.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The easy part of this journey is implementing the changes; the hard part is executing and sustaining them. As you start any change project, remember that you are not only changing the way you do business, but you are also changing the expected behavior of your employees and the culture of your organization. In many cases, their jobs will change, and the changes could require skill upgrades to perform the revised jobs. These should not be viewed as barriers to making changes but as opportunities to develop your employees and improve the competitive position of the company. We need to &amp;ldquo;move that bus&amp;rdquo; and show everyone the new storeroom.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Turn Around Your Company by Following a Lean Model</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Is anything working? Are you in trouble yet? Is it you, or is it the economy? The fact of the matter is, IT&amp;rsquo;S YOU! Why? You are the one that has to survive. It is your responsibility. Without change, things will stay the same. So, how do you go about initiating change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On a recent Business901 podcast, I discussed with Bob Weiner, CEO of PAS Technologies, how his company climbed from near the bottom of industry rankings to the top. What significant change did he make to leapfrog the competition? He invested the first week of his leadership in lean training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most professionals today have not been involved in a turnaround. They do not realize that turnarounds require a different set of skills and management techniques. My methods do not work for all and are just one way of doing it. You must decide on your course of action. I have been involved in several ventures, and failed at one of them. The results that I had were all different. I broke companies apart, sold some and worked through some. They were all different, with different goals and different results. And the bottom line is I lived to write about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, with my experience, what would I do if I was involved with one today? Though PAS did not create the model, they executed it, which is a much greater feat. My model may look a little different than how PAS did it, but it is similar in the respect that I would walk in and create a lean system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/9/c65c0507-336c-48c4-8c32-9c400d605d63_joe-dager-second-blog-chart.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 400px; height: 47px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people don&amp;rsquo;t respect the fact that you have to document what you are doing precisely. It really is like starting on a journey without knowing where you are at. If you would try to get directions from Yahoo Maps and typed in Indiana instead of Indianapolis, you may be only one hour or four hours away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your metrics play such an important part. How are you going to measure success? What in the short term will allow you to survive and in the long term build a business? Measuring simply by results is just not enough in today&amp;rsquo;s world. Using lean metrics measured by drivers are at the heart of making your plan effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a system focused on and driven by customers. Optimizing the value stream from their eyes and in an efficient process takes your processes to a level not experienced before. Review your past sales and processes that are performing well. Determine why and what may be different about them. This may help you identify a value stream much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mapping the future state is where we start seeing it all come together. This is the step everyone typically wants to jump to immediately. As a result, it can be easily abused, and a lot of waste can be left in the process. We make plans, and instead of having a sound basis, we use instincts and tools that are not directed and often based on what is called &amp;ldquo;tribal knowledge&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is the Japanese word for continuous improvement. It is all about idea submission, not acceptance. Kaizen has three steps. First, create a standard. Second, follow it. Third, find a better way. Create kaizen events on a weekly basis to improve on a particular area or metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A great learning tool is to start with a task that is working well, has little waste and just walk through the process. After you see how the process works, take one task that has what you perceive as a lot of low-hanging fruit. Walk through that process. The secret I believe to successful implementation is not trying to do too much at once. It is a journey made up of multiple events, or kaizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/SA-eHCkJzZA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Cargill Receives 2011 Dayton Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill recently received the 2011 Dayton water award at the 2nd annual Dayton Water Conference held by the Waters Innovators Alliance, a Washington, D.C., based industry association focused on reducing regulatory barriers, increasing collaboration and raising awareness for cutting edge water technologies and the problems they solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Cargill is being honored for their good water stewardship, and conservation of our valuable, yet vulnerable natural resource,&amp;quot; said James McDonald of the Dayton Water Roundtable. &amp;quot;As a major water customer in Dayton, Cargill continues to examine and implement ways to conserve, protect and reuse water and therefore was recognized for their outstanding efforts.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The past five years, the Dayton facility has seen a 22 percent per unit reduction in waterbourne waste streams and over the past three years, the Dayton facility has seen a 12.8 percent per unit reduction in water usage. In February of this year, the facility continued to look for continuous improvement processes for efficiency gains and water savings by conducting water &amp;quot;kaizen&amp;quot; events to analyze operations and find additional opportunities around water.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are honored to receive this award because we have been working on reducing our environmental impact for a long time,&amp;quot; said Marty Muenzmaier, sustainability director, Cargill Corn Milling North America.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Water is vitally important to our business and our continual focus on preserving and reusing water in our operations benefits the communities where we operate.&amp;nbsp; We are gratified by the Dayton Water Roundtable&amp;#39;s recognition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill is an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services.&amp;nbsp; Founded in 1865, the privately held company employs 131,000 people in 66 countries.&amp;nbsp; Cargill helps customers succeed through collaboration and innovation, and is committed to applying its global knowledge and experience to help meet economic, environmental and social challenges wherever it does business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/0p7g7YjtUyI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Gemba Research, Kaizen Institute combine forces to become global lean resource</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Gemba Research and Kaizen Institute announced that they will join forces to form the longest-running and most geographically diverse lean management consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The merger of our two companies allows us to provide our clients with local expertise in all key and developing markets,&amp;quot; said Bud H. Cox, president of KICG. &amp;quot;This will enable us to expand smoothly from 25 to over 30 worldwide locations by the end of 2011, as our clients are pulling us into more regions and industry sectors than ever before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is the philosophy and practice of continuous improvement by involving every person within an organization in innovation, creative thinking and practical problem solving. Organizations of all types worldwide have adopted the kaizen philosophy to achieve breakthrough results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen Institute founder Masaaki Imai, who has studied and taught kaizen for the past three decades explains, &amp;quot;Kaizen is a mind-set. Although many lean practitioners have kaizen in their toolbox, those who strive to live it each day are the people who are making a difference in people&amp;#39;s lives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KICG will offer an unparalleled breadth and depth of training and lean consulting services worldwide. Both firms have been helping clients implement kaizen, the Toyota Production System and kaizen-based business strategies for decades. These cultural transformations are achieved through kaizen tours of best-in-class companies, kaizen certification courses, online training in the full suite of lean tools and CI methods, business assessment/diagnostic services, and implementation of lean management systems in service, retail, education, government, banking, transportation, healthcare and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The approaches, philosophy and values of the two companies are very similar. Over the past year we found ourselves collaborating increasingly in lean transformation projects. We felt the time was right to take the logical next step to merge two operations fully,&amp;quot; said Jon Miller, co-founder and CEO of Gemba Research. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a great fit and we have hit the ground running as one team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Gemba Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gemba Research is a global consulting and training firm focused on helping companies implement continuous improvement (CI) cultures based on the Toyota Production System. Founded in 1998, Gemba brings unique insights into the Lean management philosophy, based on the bilingual and bicultural backgrounds of its Japan-raised founders, Jon Miller and Brad Schmidt. Gemba is recognized worldwide as a through leader in the fields of kaizen, lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Kaizen Institute &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen Institute (KI) is the longest-running consulting firm dedicated to kaizen and lean implementation. The company helps global and local organizations achieve optimum performance through kaizen strategies. KI was founded in 1985 by Masaaki Imai, one of the original pioneers who brought kaizen, lean thinking and an understanding of Japanese management practices to the West. His 1986 book, &amp;quot;KAIZEN: The Key to Japan&amp;#39;s Competitive Success&amp;quot;, was a bestseller and the milestone in the global spread of lean practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/UxHywCWiBhU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Recommendations and suggestions for 5-S auditing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The fifth&amp;nbsp;component of 5-S, Sustain,&amp;nbsp;is all about developing the discipline to use and maintain&amp;nbsp;the 5-S system on a daily basis everywhere within the organization.&amp;nbsp;Sustain means understanding how 5-S eliminates organizational waste and then making the&amp;nbsp;first four S&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;a habit and part of the company&amp;rsquo;s culture.&amp;nbsp;Sustain, for most organizations (even after the&amp;nbsp;5-S training&amp;nbsp;and 5-S kaizen events),&amp;nbsp;means 5-S audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are some recommendations and suggestions on 5-S&amp;nbsp;auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Audit scores range from 0.0 to 5.0. We&amp;nbsp;use scores in tenths.&amp;nbsp;More on this below.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		First, understand that audits,&amp;nbsp;like third-party inspection, are wasteful activities.&amp;nbsp;Like product or service quality, 5-S is an activity that we and the customer expect to pay one person to do it right the first time.&amp;nbsp;Audits do serve the short-term purpose&amp;nbsp;of both the reinforcement of the new process we are implementing (necessary if your organizations have had many&amp;nbsp;&amp;rdquo;programs of the month&amp;rdquo;) and&amp;nbsp;advanced 5-S training activities (How do&amp;nbsp;we achieve a score of a &amp;ldquo;5.0&amp;rdquo; on an audit of our work area?).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The audit team&amp;nbsp;should consist of both factory and office associates, an hourly and salary mix.&amp;nbsp;General guidelines are four to six auditors (not including the lean facilitator,&amp;nbsp;per 250-person organization). The audit team should do practice audits&amp;nbsp;to get everyone on the same page and develop a baseline.&amp;nbsp;Also, consider how government&amp;nbsp;regulations&amp;nbsp;can set baseline scores. For example, if your organization produces food or medical&amp;nbsp;products, meeting&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;FDA&amp;nbsp;workplace requirements might mean that the minimum 5-S&amp;nbsp;score for the first four S&amp;rsquo;s is a 3.0. Scores less than 3.0 might mean the FDA requirements are not being met.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, audits should occur&amp;nbsp;at least every two weeks.&amp;nbsp;Remember, it is both process reinforcement and a learning experience. As the average audit score climbs,&amp;nbsp;the audit time span can be increased. The organization should determine what the operational criteria&amp;nbsp;will be for eliminating audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5-S job instructions (the fourth S) and audit areas should be established by natural work groups and teams in both manufacturing and the office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is suggested that 5-S office guidelines be developed for each organization. Office areas, unlike manufacturing areas, can be categorized into basically one group.&amp;nbsp;The organization should create common 5-S job instructions (part of the fourth S)&amp;nbsp;that define the organization&amp;rsquo;s office 5-S expectations. Some examples are shown below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/10/15/quick/ab0cb066-7ab7-4f7a-9c23-a0904ae413e3_rubrich400.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 341px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S scoring guideline sheet is shown below for the first three S&amp;rsquo;s (Electronic copies of all 5-S guidelines, scoring, and grading charts are available upon request at &lt;a href="mailto:kelly@wcmfg.com" target="_blank"&gt;kelly@wcmfg.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich401.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It should be noted that there are special 5-S audit circumstances for safety violations.&amp;nbsp;First,&amp;nbsp;the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;that the&amp;nbsp;safety violation is covered by gets a score of &amp;ldquo;zero.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;Typically, these are second S violations.&amp;nbsp;The audit team&amp;nbsp;must immediately notify&amp;nbsp;the responsible supervisor and the&amp;nbsp;safety violation must be corrected immediately.&amp;nbsp;The audit must confirm the correction (the score does not change after correction).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S grading sheet is shown below. Note that as important as the&amp;nbsp;score is,&amp;nbsp;comments on what needs to improved upon to achieve a score of 5.0 also&amp;nbsp;must be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich402.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, we believe audit scores should be posted (high to low) in a very visible area of the organization so everyone can see how the organization is doing. The high scores and&amp;nbsp;the 5-S activities, in general, should&amp;nbsp;be one topic in the organization&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;monthly&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;all hands&amp;rdquo; meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, the&amp;nbsp;business will develop its own 5-S expertise&amp;nbsp;when new&amp;nbsp;5-S safety, organizing methods,&amp;nbsp;clean-up techniques&amp;nbsp;and other 5-S methods&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;established. Audit procedures and scoring should be adjusted to these developments, thus&amp;nbsp;raising the bar to the new baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the required measures for the success of your audits and 5-S implementation&amp;nbsp;in general&amp;nbsp;includes never having to clean up in advance&amp;nbsp;of customer or other special company visitors. Always being&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;tour&amp;rdquo; or&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;visit&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;ready is an important 5-S measure.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why you need to create a standard process for spare parts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What do you see in this picture? Besides a lack of any real 5-S, what thoughts come to your kaizen mind about the motors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/f8ebd521-560e-4e93-83a5-ce63d2f59200_wroblewski001.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 226px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps you may think about what are the motors used for? Do we really need them? Are they critical? How fast can we get one if we needed it? What is our process to decide what parts to keep in stock? Or, how much do they cost?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the elements of a solid Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) program that does not get much attention is our spare parts. Simply taking good care of our machines and equipment does not entirely eliminate the chance of them breaking down. When that happens, the fire drill begins.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Go to any maintenance department in any company in the country and you find many things in common, like a storage area for supplies and parts. Since this is typically viewed as a non-production area, we tend to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With a kaizen approach, we need to improve all areas of our company, including spare parts. With a good TPM program, we should develop standard processes that establish the method to determine what parts to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	First, a team-based approach is best used to identify the critical parts that we may need. We can use the recommended spare parts list by the manufacturer, but only as a starting point. Many times, this list of parts can include more parts than we should keep. Look at the machine history but also take care not to include a part just because we got burned back in 1982 when it broke down for six months.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a guideline, critical parts can be identified as &amp;ldquo;recent chronic problem areas&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;difficult to obtain within 24 to 48 hours&amp;rdquo;. Cost should NOT be a factor. If the chance of a problem is high and we are left waiting days or weeks for the parts to come in, it&amp;rsquo;s better to keep these parts on hand no matter what the cost of the part is. Compare it to lost business, customer disappointments, etc., to factor in the decision. Discuss this with your team and company management to determine what makes the best sense in your situation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Once we have a plan, set up a spare parts list for each piece of equipment and clearly identify the parts in the stock area.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As all things in lean, this is not a static process; it&amp;rsquo;s dynamic. The spare parts list needs to be reviewed on a regular basis &amp;ndash; perhaps once a year. Machines fall out of warranty or the manufacturer no longer supports this model in either service or parts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Without a standard process for our spare parts, we may find parts on the shelves like those in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Florida city government utilizing lean manufacturing principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The city of Cape Coral, Fla., is creating a model of excellence in lean city government by implementing lean waste-free (Toyota Production System) principles. Cape Coral began transforming in August 2007 by using kaizen methodologies to establish new breakthrough processes. The results are in the millions, exceeding any Baldrige Award winner by setting ROI of 20X.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Improving culture at a food manufacturing plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kettleby Foods in the United Kingdom engaged in a program of improvements to the culture of its organization which helped reduce overall accidents by 77 percent and RIDDORs by 83 percent over a five-year period (2003-2008). The company identified that human error and failures to follow procedures had contributed to the majority of its accidents. Despite putting many managers through the IOSH Managing Safely program, the company realized it was not utilizing the knowledge gained effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Approximately five years ago, Kettleby Foods started looking at various off-the-shelf behavioral safety systems, but after evaluating content, methodology and cost, it felt that these systems didn&amp;rsquo;t actually provide the fit for which the organization was looking. The company felt a more appropriate way forward would be to develop something themselves which fitted more naturally with the existing culture and values of the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	When referring to the initiatives introduced by the company, Kettleby Foods is keen to stress that safety is an integral part of the company&amp;rsquo;s core business. As such, it does not talk about &amp;ldquo;safety culture&amp;rdquo; but the &amp;ldquo;organizational culture&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company now runs a number of different programs, all of which have safety benefits and are helping to continually shape the culture of the business. Three of these initiatives are described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		MaST &amp;ndash; inspection and audit of the workplace&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Behavioral intervention with a poorer-performing shift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In all three projects, it is important to note that improvements to safety and efficiency in the business are driven forward by the enthusiasm and commitment of the managing director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Management Safety Tour (MaST)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The MaST system is loosely based on a program adopted in the rail industry. The process is overseen by a steering group. One of the key features of this program of work is the commitment and support offered by the managing director. This person invited members of the senior management team &amp;ndash; including the finance director, production director, quality and purchasing managers to become directly involved in an audit process concentrating on health and safety in the workplace. The senior management team &amp;ndash; including the MD, FD and PD &amp;ndash; actively engage employees in talking about health and safety in the workplace, and visibly demonstrate their commitment (in terms of time and money) to making the workplace safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key feature is the respect which the directors and senior management team show for their employees. They recognize and value the commitment and contribution of all their employees. It is noticeable that most statements begin with the word &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company divided the site into 23 areas (including often-forgotten space such as the roof space where maintenance work is carried out), and allocated each to a director or manager of the company. No manager was allocated a department that he or she normally works in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The managers carry out audits of the department on a three-month cycle. In the first month, they audit the department; and in the following two months, they follow up on the issues raised and make sure that all the actions identified in the audit are closed out. After each three-month cycle, the process is repeated on a different shift (AM, PM, Nights and Weekends) because processes and issues can be very different across the different shifts. After a year, the manager is allocated a different area to audit to ensure a &amp;ldquo;fresh eyes&amp;rdquo; approach is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each audit is agreed with the person responsible for that department beforehand, and staff is forewarned that it is going to happen. This process is more about auditing procedures (rather than individuals), and the company found that it was paramount to establish an atmosphere of trust. Employees are encouraged to point out any health and safety concerns they may have. The audits are seen as a team process involving the manager carrying out the audit, the manager responsible for the department, and a &amp;ldquo;guide&amp;rdquo; (i.e. a shop floor worker with knowledge about the equipment, task and environment being inspected). In addition, other employees might be asked to demonstrate or explain a task they are required to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rather than a typical audit approach of identifying issues for departmental managers to resolve, the MaST audit is based on a problem-solving approach where auditors work with the managers and employees to identify solutions. In this way, employees are involved and interact with managers across all departments and shifts in the management of health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the audit, the three discuss and agree their findings, which are then documented. For any serious issues which cannot be resolved at the time of the audit, a MaST &amp;ldquo;non-conformance&amp;rdquo; is issued. Both immediate and longer-term actions are recorded to confirm what was done at the time to improve matters and to record what additional controls are required to prevent reoccurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On completion of all additional actions, each non-conformance is reviewed by the managing director (MD) and health, safety and environmental (HSE) manager and finally signed off as completed by the MD. The documentation reviews include ensuring that appropriate control measures are being applied (e.g. there is not over-reliance on editing procedures or providing training, and that engineering solutions are properly considered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, the company found that many of the concerns and issues raised during audits were relatively minor (e.g. a screw missing from a fixed guard held in place by another 11 screws). This led to an initial peak in the workload of the engineering department. However, they found that by acting quickly on these small matters, they gained the trust of their employees, who realized that the audits were not to catch them out, and that managers would take their concerns seriously and act on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, as trust was further developed between staff and managers, the company has found that employees are more willing to bring unworkable procedures and unsafe practices to the attention of managers. If employees are seen to be working unsafely, the company investigates whether the procedures are adequate and whether the training is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A spreadsheet was set up and posted on the company intranet and notice boards, which are available to all employees, to record when the audits are being carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If audits have been carried out on time, they are colored green. If carried out late, they are colored amber; and if not carried out at all, they are colored red. In the early stages of the project, many of the managers failed to carry out all their audits on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite providing training for all the managers in the audit process, one of the problems later identified was a lack of confidence on the part of managers in their ability to audit departments. Another was that managers felt they didn&amp;rsquo;t have sufficient time to give to the process. The MD wrote to all the defaulting managers at their home address, explaining his disappointment that they had not carried out the agreed work. This was found to have a highly motivational effect. He and the HSE manager also spent time explaining to managers that simply spending the time talking to employees about health and safety for a period of time (however short) would have a positive benefit for the company and that confidence would come with experience. Since the start of 2009, all audits have been completed within the required timescale and colored green. This has also had a self-perpetuating effect in that no manager wants to be the first to score a &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; and, therefore, disappoint the MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was found that many of the actions identified in the audit were taking too long to be carried out and that for some matters which required longer to put in place, employees were becoming frustrated that nothing was being done. In addition to the non-conformances being a key performance indicator of the steering group, one manager suggested putting up a notice board in his department, which allowed employees to see what issues had been identified, and what progress was being made against them. This motivated managers to act more quickly on the more easily solved problems and also demonstrated to employees that managers were actively engaged in resolving more complex and difficult issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system has evolved over time with some departments and areas being merged together. This has freed up trained auditors to look more closely at specific safety critical systems, such as permit-to-work and management of contractors, Legionella, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the company is keen to stress that this is very much a &amp;ldquo;work in progress&amp;rdquo; and is a long-term, continuously improving program which needs to be actively managed throughout. The company has been running MaST for three years and says the system is still evolving and it still has some way to go despite the success. The company is keen to learn what other firms and organizations are doing which might add value to its own system. Kettleby Foods has learned a great deal, not just from its own experience of accidents and incidents, but from helpful contacts in other industries and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral intervention with a poorer-performing shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company observed that one shift in a production area had a significantly higher number of accidents than another shift in the same area. It carried out a four-step intervention to try to discover why this was so, and what could be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The production and HSE managers met with employees to explain the situation and to gain an agreement that something needed to be done to improve. It was felt at this stage that improvements could be effective through the introduction of a few simple &amp;ldquo;Golden Rules&amp;rdquo; that all the team would commit to.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; A safety climate survey was carried out with the employees on the shift to find out their attitudes and beliefs about safety. The results of the survey indicated that staff members believed they behaved safely but the environment was inherently unsafe. The company felt that this was a reversal of the facts given that employees do not necessarily behave safely and that other shifts did not have problems in the same environment. The challenge for the project was to try and change the employees&amp;rsquo; perceptions and gain their agreement to behaving more safely.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The managers and employees met again to discuss the results of the survey. During the meeting, employees cited a number of unsafe conditions in the area, leading them to feel the area was unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the use of a number of photographs and open discussion, employees gradually accepted that it was their own behavior that led to these unsafe conditions (such as leaving trip hazards and not clearing up spillages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/health101.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Examples of Photos Shown to Employees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to make changes in the area, team members were asked to identify some golden rules that everyone would commit to following. The company felt the right way to proceed was for team members to come up with the golden rules as they were more likely to follow rules of their own making.&lt;br /&gt;
	After a few ideas and discussion, the employees came up with their own golden rule about how they would behave in future: &amp;ldquo;I will never carry out an unsafe act OR leave an unsafe condition (hazard) in the workplace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This golden rule is not dissimilar to those imposed on employees at other companies, but importantly, at this company, the employees came up with it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; After six months, they reviewed progress on improving safety in this department. The accident rate has already been significantly reduced (42 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company stresses that this intervention worked in the context of the wider, long-running MaST program. A great deal of work had already been done to convince employees of management commitment to their safety and management&amp;rsquo;s willingness to put things right before they worked with this particular department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another of the ongoing initiatives the company is engaged in is &amp;ldquo;continuous improvement&amp;rdquo;, which incorporates productivity, quality and efficiency, as well as health and safety. They have a number of programs running including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kaizen teams&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5-S&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Value stream mapping (VSM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although these programs are not necessarily aimed at improving safety, the principles involved are transferable to any specific function of the business, and the company has found that they have provided many health and safety benefits.&lt;br /&gt;
	The company has used kaizen teams to look at specific issues such as communications and for improving safety on specific tasks. The lean tool of 5-S improves efficiency by keeping everything in its place and is good for controlling housekeeping hazards such as slips and trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	VSM is a process for streamlining how a product is manufactured. Generally, it is used to improve efficiency and increase the rate of production. From a human factors perspective, people tend to seek the most efficient way to carry out a task. Where this is built in to the process, they are much less likely to deviate from the system of work designed by the company, thus reducing the likelihood of violations.&lt;br /&gt;
	The company says that the key messages are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To lead from the top;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To keep it simple; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To work within the existing systems and culture of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Visual inventory control without paper kanban cards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Robert Krause has implemented a simple visual inventory control (VIC) system, or a warehouse distribution application. This system does not require costly transaction intensive inventory control systems. It uses wireless kanban cards to replenish primary bins without the traditional paper kanban cards, which could be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Xerox ink facility embraces process improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Members of Xerox&amp;rsquo;s leadership are principal advocates for using Lean Six Sigma to institute change in everyday decision making involving everything from manufacturing to finance. Under visible commitment from former and current CEOs Anne Mulcahy and Ursula Burns, there has been a cultural shift at Xerox toward making Lean Six Sigma inherent in everyday project selection and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solid ink Jetstack operation team in Wilsonville, Ore., is a marked example of the progression from initial adoption of Lean Six Sigma ideas to embedded principles in operations that are driving business results for Xerox. Solid ink technology utilizes solid ink sticks in lieu of fluid ink or toner powder. After the ink stick is loaded into the printing device, it is melted and used to produce images on paper in a process similar to offset printing. Jetstacks are stainless steel plates that route ink from reservoirs to the jets that dispense the ink from the printer. The steps in the manufacturing process of Jetstacks are detailed and precise, and the team has recently completed several Lean Six Sigma projects that optimize the manufacturing process to meet the strict requirements in a more efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first project addressed the clean room portion of the Jetstack manufacturing. The team needed to add new equipment to increase capacity, but had little floor space to do so. Increased capacity also created a prime opportunity to identify overall efficiency improvement opportunities. Lean Six Sigma black belts from other Xerox locations visited Wilsonville to lend expertise, providing training and project guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A DMA (define-measure-analyze) blitz, commonly called a kaizen, was used for the project &amp;ndash; leveraging Lean Six Sigma tools in a condensed time period to deliver immediate, tangible results. The team began by mapping the Jetstack manufacturing process step by step for a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of constraints and areas of the process which presented opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the team was ready to make informed, knowledge-based recommendations, a brainstorm led to approximately 200 improvement ideas. A benefit/effort matrix was used to identify the solutions that would make the most impact. End results included 220 reclaimed square feet of room for new equipment and more than $1 million in capital savings due to reduced cycle times and improved efficiencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By the time a second project was initiated, the team had matured to the point of training employees and leading projects independently. The cultural shift toward making Lean Six Sigma &amp;ldquo;the way of work&amp;rdquo; had eliminated the need to obtain black belt resources from other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The pre-clean room manufactures a part of the Jetstack system proprietary to Xerox. The Lean Six Sigma project aimed to build on the success of the clean room kaizen by increasing throughput in the pre-clean room without investing in additional equipment. Further goals of the project included reducing opportunities for injury, scrap and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team was able to reduce scrap, improve organization and create a more efficient use of floor space and labor, saving Xerox approximately $450,000. The project also helped reduce negative impact on the environment by adding recycling efforts and identifying unnecessary power consumption. In addition, the team met the goal of decreasing opportunities for employee injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having Lean Six Sigma expertise in-house at the Wilsonville facility has been a valuable asset, allowing the team to review the operation as a comprehensive system and deliver significantly more efficient and robust processes. Before Wilsonville built a strong, Lean Six Sigma-trained team, these inefficiencies may have fallen through the cracks. But now, they are addressed and optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lean book author honored with Shingo Prize</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A long-time advocate of lean practices, &lt;a href="http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/getsmepg.pl?/new-sme.html&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;SME&amp;amp;"&gt;Society of Manufacturing Engineers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;member and author, Mark Hamel has been awarded &lt;a href="http://www.shingoprize.org/htm/award-info/application-guidelines/research-award-guidelines"&gt;The Shingo Prize Research &amp;amp; Professional Publications Award&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the &lt;em&gt;Kaizen Event Fieldbook&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given out this week in Utah at The Shingo Prize Annual Conference, the Shingo Research Award recognizes and promotes research and writing regarding new knowledge and understanding of lean and operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Receiving the Shingo Research &amp;amp; Professional Publication Award is truly an honor and, at the same time, very humbling,&amp;rdquo; said author Mark Hamel. &amp;ldquo;The award is recognition of not only my work, but also that of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-item.pl?BK09PUB16&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;SME"&gt;Kaizen Event Fieldbook&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;contributors, reviewers, editors and many others in the lean community who helped make the book better than it would have been. I hope that leaders and practitioners find the Fieldbook&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the overall lean body of knowledge value-added.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In context with lean theory and lean leadership principles, the &lt;em&gt;Kaizen Event Fieldbook&lt;/em&gt; provides an understanding of the essential &amp;quot;whys&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hows&amp;quot; of kaizen event standard work and event management. It addresses strategy, pre-event planning, execution and follow-through in a multi-phase approach. This bookcontains practical examples, over a hundred figures and tables and many real-life &amp;quot;Gemba Tales&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even before receiving this accolade, Hamel&amp;rsquo;s book had been acknowledged as a &amp;ldquo;must-have&amp;rdquo; reference book for any lean library. &amp;ldquo;A critical distinction from other texts on the market, the Fieldbook links the technical aspects of kaizen to lean philosophy. Kaizen is the game changer in any lean transformation, and this is the game book,&amp;rdquo; according to Bruce Hamilton, president of the Greater Boston Manufacturing Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the rigorous review given to the numerous new lean publications, lean practitioners can use The Shingo Research Prize as a way to filter through the many references available and identify the most relevant and noteworthy titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Since The Shingo Prize itself has been compared to the Nobel Prize, then The Shingo Research Prize is like the Pulitzer,&amp;rdquo; said Mark C. Tomlinson, executive director and general manager, SME. &amp;ldquo;And we are proud to have the &lt;em&gt;Fieldbook&lt;/em&gt; in our large pool of lean knowledge, resources and certifications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Hamel, 272 pages, hardcover, ISBN 13:978-0-87263-863-1, Product ID: BK09PUB16, Book Price: $50, SME Member Price: $45. &lt;a href="http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-item.pl?BK09PUB16&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;SME"&gt;Order online&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or call 800-733-4763.

            <title>Plant workers relate how Toyota lost its way</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Toyota Way.&amp;rdquo; For a generation, it was the gold standard of corporate slogans, as the Japanese automaker rose to No. 1 in the world by &amp;ndash; to borrow another famous mantra &amp;ndash; doing well by doing good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the corporate principles behind Toyota&amp;rsquo;s image have been seriously tarnished by revelations that its rush to the top led to compromises in its commitment to safety, resulting in the recall of more than 9 million vehicles worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For an even more searingly personal look at how Toyota lost its way, go to the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) plant in Fremont, Calif., where the most profitable automaker in the world is preparing for its first major plant closure, bidding farewell to 4,700 workers who bought into the idea they would have job security if they did their jobs well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;In 2008, the Indianapolis Department of Public Works&amp;nbsp;began streamlining the city&amp;#39;s pothole repair process.The Chuckhole Kaizen Response, implemented with the assistance of Eli Lilly Six Sigma black belts, offers better planning, scheduling, routing and customer reporting. Potholes are now being addressed from a two-tier aspect, including preventive maintenance through crack-sealing and better repair practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Japan fretting over manufacturing quality</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota&amp;rsquo;s recall of 8.5 million cars, trucks and sports utility vehicles in recent months has shocked Japan, home of manufacturing innovations such as the kaizen philosophy of continuous improvement and Total Quality Management. But while there is little evidence that Japan has got worse at making things &amp;ndash; in spite of fretting triggered by Toyota&amp;rsquo;s recalls &amp;ndash; quality has become a big problem for Japanese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Professor: Recalls leave major dent in Toyota's brand identity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Japanese automaker Toyota is navigating uncharted territory these days. The Japanese company &amp;ndash; the world&amp;#39;s largest by sales &amp;ndash; recently recalled about 8.5 million vehicles globally in three separate actions and briefly halted sales and production of some models in the United States. Toyota is an industry leader in quality and safety. Books have been written about its production system. Now the company faces Congressional hearings as repairs to the vehicles &amp;ndash; and the company&amp;#39;s image &amp;ndash; get under way. Martin Zimmerman, the Ford Motor Company Clinical Professor of Business Administration at Ross, says Toyota&amp;rsquo;s well-earned reputation for quality and safety hinges on management&amp;#39;s response to the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;With three recalls covering so many popular cars and trucks, what is the management challenge for Toyota here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Zimmerman: &lt;/strong&gt;For Toyota, having all these things coming at the same time is leading to uncertainty in the mind of the consumer. One question Toyota has to ask itself is, &amp;ldquo;Did we respond to all the information that we had?&amp;rdquo; That would be a key item. They may well ask if they need some centralized information center where worldwide safety and field information comes in and somebody is charged with acting on it. And they have to decide how to extend that across borders. For example, the Prius brake issue apparently started in Europe a while ago. So they have to be thinking about that overall process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given how far this situation has gone, their first step is to correct the problems, find out exactly what they are. That is not easy and it takes time. Then they have to fix them and, just as importantly, fix the process so something like this doesn&amp;#39;t happen again. Finally, they have to communicate to the public that the process has been improved and communicate that well. Right now, they are in the &amp;ldquo;fix it&amp;rdquo; phase. Then they&amp;#39;ll begin the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The longer-term issue really is about the process they use. Toyota is justifiably famous for their quality processes &amp;ndash; kaizen, or continuous improvement, and a culture where factory workers can stop the line if there&amp;#39;s a problem. All these things led to high quality and built their reputation. They have to convince customers that although there was a slip-up somewhere, they&amp;#39;re on top of it, they know what went wrong, they will correct it, and they will prevent it from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s at stake for Toyota? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Zimmerman: &lt;/strong&gt;Toyota&amp;#39;s reputation is built on quality and safety, hallmarks that go to the very characteristics of the brand for Toyota. Because these recalls came one after another &amp;ndash; the floor mats, the accelerator and the Prius brakes &amp;ndash; they raise issues of systemic failure, and that&amp;#39;s their basic management problem right now. The advantage they have is their history of satisfying customers and a loyal customer base. It&amp;#39;s a customer base that will be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Toyota has to convince them, though, that they will solve the problems and be on top of future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Are they under extra scrutiny in the U.S. because they are a foreign-owned company? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Zimmerman: &lt;/strong&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s getting attention because the problems go to the characteristics that have been reasons for their success. When you&amp;#39;re on the inside, you tend to develop this sense you&amp;#39;re being picked on. I was at Ford during the Firestone recall and you do have the feeling everyone is piling on. An article in the New York Times recently indicated that some companies are happy Toyota&amp;#39;s getting some heat. There&amp;#39;s a little schadenfreude, maybe. But these are serious issues, serious questions, and I don&amp;#39;t think Toyota&amp;#39;s being picked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Overall, how has Toyota handled the situation, especially with President Akio Toyoda&amp;#39;s public apology? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Zimmerman: &lt;/strong&gt;It could have come sooner, but I understand the tension. The higher you go up in a corporation to take charge of a problem, the bigger the problem you&amp;#39;re saying it is. This is also complicated by the fact that the top management is in Japan and the problem is mostly here in North America. But you have to demonstrate to consumers that you take the problem seriously. Given the potential damage to the brand capital, it is fitting that the top guy got up and said, &amp;ldquo;We are going to fix this, we&amp;#39;ll get on top of it, and I&amp;#39;m sorry that it happened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for the response to the problems themselves, I think they were slow getting out of the starting gate in terms of communications with the public, but I think they&amp;#39;re catching up. It was slow in the sense that the key item is to communicate to consumers what the nature of the problem is, the fix, and what we&amp;#39;re going to do in the future to ensure these vehicles are safe. Having said that, when it&amp;#39;s a complicated issue like this, it does take time to know the source of the problem and the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Given the publicity and the fact that Toyota halted sales and production for a time, is there going to be market share to take and who is poised to take it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Zimmerman: &lt;/strong&gt;In the short term, this is certainly going to affect Toyota&amp;#39;s sales. It&amp;#39;s likely to lead some Toyota consumers to at least consider alternative brands. I think the longer-term issue is whether Toyota is successful in establishing and solidifying the long-held reputation for quality. That&amp;#39;ll be the test. If they do, then any market share loss will be short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in the short term, I think competitors will benefit. This is a very competitive market. A number of analysts suggest Ford and Honda are poised to benefit. General Motors, Hyundai, and others could take some share as well. But, again, the longer-term issue is whether Toyota can protect its reputation for quality. That is the risk to them right now. They certainly recognize the issue. The first step is to make sure the repairs go as smoothly as possible, then deal with the Congressional hearings, fix the process, and communicate with their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/uVsGv1ZKbvE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Storage products company practices what it preaches</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems fitting that a company that provides storage and workplace solutions for business and industry &amp;ndash; and whose motto is &amp;ldquo;making workspace work&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; should embark on an innovative lean manufacturing program to drive waste out of its own manufacturing processes, resulting in top-quality, competitively priced products, delivered in the shortest time possible. And it is even more fitting that the company would turn to its own products to make the move to lean an especially successful one.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our goal as an organization is to delight the customer with all aspects of our products and service,&amp;rdquo; says Peter Lariviere, president of Lista International Corporation. &amp;ldquo;We achieve this through the elimination of costly waste and the implementation of standard work throughout every aspect of the organization, from quoting an order to receipt of payment. Our goal is to provide our customers with moments of excellence throughout our value stream. We strive to be best in industry, in terms of quality, breadth and flexibility of product line, and lead time. Integrating the use of Lista products into our processes has resulted in significant progress in achieving our objectives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista International, an ISO 9001 certified company, is one of North America&amp;rsquo;s leading manufacturers of storage and workspace systems. Established in 1968 in Holliston, Mass., the corporate headquarters houses a 225,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, as well as design and engineering offices. Lista North America is part of Swiss-based Lista Group, a leader in the manufacture of modular drawer storage systems, workbenches and storage solutions for a wide range of markets and applications. Lista Group employs more than 600 people worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lean Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista&amp;rsquo;s goal is to use lean manufacturing concepts to provide customers a broader, improved offering of high-quality, custom-configured products with the shortest turnaround time in the industry. Lista&amp;rsquo;s emphasis is on driving out complexity to create a highly flexible manufacturing environment. The results are impressive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The foundation for the lean program began with material flow and process flow improvements made about four years ago. In the last year, Lista has really turned the corner and has steadily reduced its turnaround time from more than two weeks to as little as two to four business days for many popular products. Along the way, they&amp;rsquo;ve moved work centers close together, eliminated travel in the process line, and significantly eliminated waste throughout their delivery system. The company has been able to reduce its inventory by more than 35 percent, while at the same time reducing lead times and improving customer service. Overall, Lista has realized greatly increased productivity and efficiency, and reduced its requirements for floor space.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We made fundamental changes in the order and delivery system and the manner in which we drive customer orders through our production process with demand replenishment concepts and principles. Kanban is a major component of our manufacturing process, and Lista products are ideal for the application of the kanban systems,&amp;rdquo; said Lariviere. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always had fully customizable solutions in our standard two-week delivery program, and now we have customizable products in our Lista Xpress two- to four-day turnaround express delivery program. Lean manufacturing allows us to extend our capabilities &amp;ndash; to expand what we can provide to customers in the shortest lead time possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lean Manufacturing Toolkit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lean manufacturing uses a set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste. Among the ones Lista uses are value stream mapping, the 5-S workplace organization and housekeeping system (sort, set in place, shine, standardize, sustain), and a kanban order and inventory withdrawal system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are always looking internally to reduce non-value added process and movement time,&amp;rdquo; said Aaron Tessitore, director of operations, who says that lean methods enabled the Xpress delivery offering to consist of configured, built-to-order products rather than off-the-shelf stocked products. &amp;ldquo;Lista shares the same types of concerns as its customers, such as reducing inventory, consolidating facilities, minimizing floor space, and increasing cash flow. A welcome by-product has been waste elimination and cost reduction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storage Company, Store Thyself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the interesting features about this particular lean manufacturing process is that Lista uses its own product line to help implement the results of the value stream mapping, the 5-S and the kanban setup. Lista products are now totally integrated into its manufacturing process.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When you think about it,&amp;rdquo; says John Grover, director of lean manufacturing, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s like the reverse of the old saying that the cobbler&amp;rsquo;s children have no shoes. In our case, as an industrial storage company, we had access to a product line that helped us implement waste elimination through space reduction, organization improvement and inventory management. Lista storage cabinets and workbench products are designed to allow dense storage and a smaller footprint. From a material flow standpoint, the Lista flexible workbench line and modular tables made it very easy to add flexibility to the production lines that facilitated faster turnaround time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In fact, Lista has long been a solutions provider for lean manufacturers, whether the company needs high-density storage or a highly flexible line of workbench products. The 5-S principles are a capsule description of the leading features of the company&amp;rsquo;s products: highly organized (sort), ideal for tracking inventory (set in place), aesthetically pleasing and easily kept clean (shine), modular in design (standardize) and scalable (sustain).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The system is set up so everything has a place that is available when needed, from the finished goods area where products are being packaged, through the equipment maintenance area. Everything is labeled and identified using Lista&amp;rsquo;s built-in labeling and identification features, making a 5-S system that is very flexible for whatever the organizational needs may be. Local storage minimizes travel time, and adjustable storage and workbenches make it easier to adapt to the differing needs of individual employees.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lean Manufacturing Benefits Customers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Although lean is sometimes thought of as the ultimate cost-cutting program, Lista&amp;rsquo;s program focused more on customer benefits. &amp;ldquo;All the work we did in our program took aim at compressing the cycle time, which gives our customers added flexibility and minimizes the lead time for our product line, which gives us a competitive advantage in the market,&amp;rdquo; said Tessitore.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The company is also able to roll out an improved Xpress delivery program offering, with a much more flexible and configurable product, all with a two- to four-day shipping time. Before, because Xpress program products were pre-built and stocked in a warehouse, it was not possible to change anything about an Xpress product to respond to a specific need. The new lean process gives Lista more flexibility in delivering virtually the same turnaround with a much more customizable product that is exactly what the customer wants, not just &amp;ldquo;pretty much&amp;rdquo; what the customer wants.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Higher quality is also a result of this effort. Fewer components are being made on a job-by-job basis and there are fewer components to deal with during final assembly. This significantly reduces the potential for short shipments and/or mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Value Stream Mapping &amp;ndash; Driving Waste out of Delivery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista used value stream mapping to analyze the material, process and information flow used to drive customer requirements and satisfaction goals across the organization. The information was used to develop a current state map, which sets out how things were done. The firm then used a cross-functional team to analyze the current state map to identify opportunities for waste elimination. Finally, the team envisioned a future state based on the exercise. Lista employees at all levels were deeply involved in the value stream mapping and remain involved in the implementation, which gives the organization access to the best thinking and input.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista then began work on implementing the future state. The process is iterative; the future state becomes the current state, and Lista uses a continuous improvement process to go back and identify new ways to reduce waste. Waste is defined very broadly, and includes things like waste in the movement of material, carrying too much inventory, defects or rework, or producing scrap.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One concrete outcome was the elimination of the need for the company&amp;rsquo;s 17,000-square-foot finished goods inventory warehouse. Since moving toward a build-to-order Xpress system, Lista no longer needs to stock finished goods and has been able to eliminate the warehouse requirement.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kanban &amp;ndash; Stocking/Replenishing System Cuts Overstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another key step that drove turnaround times down to the two- to four-day shipping window for Xpress products was the institution of a kanban system, an inventory replenishment system for just-in-time production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The system calls for a careful analysis of the manufacturing process, which determined that fabrication of the steel parts prior to being powder coated took the greatest amount of time. Rather than basing manufacturing on customer orders, the new kanban system is directed by usage models, which ensures that just enough stock is ready to paint and assemble to fulfill customer orders. This means Lista no longer has to keep finished goods inventory in stock, but always has material ready to paint and assemble to order.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Lista&amp;rsquo;s kanban system uses a visual board set up with all the parts listed for a particular work center. Signals are loaded based on consumption, and the operator can see the rate at which parts are being consumed. The entire manufacturing activities are the result of a visual-based demand replenishment system. Operators can see how fast the parts they manufacture are being consumed and can react quickly and decisively to ensure customer requirements are met. The system empowers employees, and allows them to fulfill needs in real time, rather than making products in a sequence which is based on paper-intensive material requirements planning (MRP) documents.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The kanban system is used to streamline production for Lista&amp;rsquo;s high-volume, repetitive-demand products, primarily the company&amp;rsquo;s most popular workbenches and cabinets. This is about 80 to 85 percent of the company&amp;rsquo;s output.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a shift in a way of looking at the process,&amp;rdquo; says Grover. &amp;ldquo;This is what is meant by lean &amp;ndash; not just eliminating waste in the process, but doing things that are required to add value to the customers, at the lowest cost point in the process and earliest phases. Lean manufacturing pulls all these pieces together, giving you the toolkit, mind-set and the methodology to keep working at a continuous improvement process in an extremely effective manner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/RPZEeFtIocU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Supplier relationships in a lean enterprise</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The traditional purchasing model has buyers and suppliers as adversaries â¦ or at least competitors. The supplier is trying to bid just low enough to get a contract while the buyer is looking for the lowest price. The buyer continually is applying pressure to the supplier, and the supplier has no way to meet the buyerâs demands without sacrificing something. Ultimately, at least one of the organizations loses. However, the lean buyer-supplier model is one of cooperation. The buyer and supplier are partners. If the buyer succeeds, the supplier succeeds. What does such a relationship look like?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Entering an outsourcing relationship must create value for both the supplier and buyer. To accomplish this, it is important that the supplier be given the tools and incentives to succeed. &amp;nbsp;First of all, âopen bookâ or transparent costing must be in place. That is, the buyer should be able to know how much it costs the supplier to produce components. The buyerâs goal is no longer to maximize its own profits and minimize the profits of the supplier. Instead, both organizations must work toward increasing total value.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An outsourcing contract need not specify the pricing on each item that the supplier will provide; it should specify the method by which prices will be determined. The buyer and supplier need to gain agreement on pricing. Initial pricing can be based on supplier cost plus a reasonable percentage for profit. Generally speaking, pricing on existing products should be expected to decrease. The buyer must challenge the supplier to decrease pricing through productivity improvements, and some form of gain-sharing should be specified. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The buyer must ensure that the supplier has the tools to accomplish such improvements. A lean organization must help its suppliers get lean by assisting them in activities such as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Value stream mapping training and implementation 
&lt;LI&gt;5-S training and implementation 
&lt;LI&gt;Kaizen events focused on cellular manufacturing/one-piece flow, TPM, quick changeover and other basic lean tools 
&lt;LI&gt;Setting up kanban systems &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If an organization makes such investments in its suppliers, it will build an environment of trust and will create the necessary conditions for its suppliers to succeed. If an organizationâs suppliers are successful, its supply chains will be successful: overall lead time, inventory and costs will decrease. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Kaizen events help GPI dramatically rein in costs</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;In order to ensure its team was maximizing the businessâ performance levels, Graphic Packaging International (GPI), one of the worldâs largest producers of packaging solutions with 15,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues over â¬13 Billion, turned to Breakthrough Management Group International (BMGI) to develop and execute a lean program. An internationally recognized leader in performance excellence and innovation, BMGI is working with GPI to conduct kaizen events using BMGIâs signature SCORE methodology. Three such events have so far resulted in hard cost savings of Â£175,000 per year.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;The focus up until now has been on GPIâs manufacturing facility in Bristol in the United Kingdom, which has an employee base of more than 200 and specializes in packaging solutions for the food and beverage industry. Here, GPIâs management team worked with BMGI consultants to identify the siteâs performance issues and then quantify and prioritise opportunities for improvement. BMGI consultants worked with a team of cross-functional employees to implement lean principles, eliminating waste and variation whilst ensuring improved customer satisfaction. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Jeff Goold, GPIâs U.K. site and European manufacturing director, comments: âWe dramatically reduced waste and cost; we transformed the speed of our manufacturing processes; and ultimately we improved the experience we are able to offer our customers.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;To run the kaizen events successfully, improvement teams were formed and trained under BMGIâs structured methodology, SCORE â standing for Select-Clarify-Organise-Run-and-Evaluate â to maximize the return on lean improvement projects. During these events at the Bristol facility, GPIâs machine operators not only highlighted key areas for improvement, but also signaled the beginning of a dramatic shift-change in the company culture. This, in turn, has had a profound effect on the results achieved.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Overall, BMGI has helped GPI save Â£175,000 per year, representative of a 3:1 return on investment. The assignment has increased the manufacturersâ production productivity by 90 percent, enabling better customer service and a significant reduction in overtime. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;âBy involving everyone in the process the results have become absolutely sustainable. Even in its infancy this exercise proved to be incredibly powerful. The willingness to move forward is remarkable and more beneficial than anything we have ever implemented before. Employees on the shop floor are now driving themselves and have adopted a pro-active, âcan-do attitudeââ, says Kevin Brown, GPIâs finishing area production manager.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Having proved so successful in the U.K., GPIâs business in Igualada, Spain, launched a lean project using a similar approach and it is now projected that later this year, a third European plant will begin its Lean effort in Masnieres, France. BMGI will make full use of its global footprint and local language capabilities to continue to drive global results through localized execution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/myWRXNE_QZo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The words in the title of this article, which were spoken by Taiichi Ohno, have been one of his most popular and well-known sayings within our lean community. Typically, we use his famous words to stress the importance of establishing standard work as a baseline to measure any changes to signify actual improvement in our process. Without standard work, we cannot be sure what impact our changes had on our process. The emphasis of standard work is clearly placed at the beginning of the kaizen process.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We teach the kaizen process to be four distinct steps:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Establish the existing standard work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Analyze the current process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make improvements (Plan-Do-Check-Act).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Document the new standard work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From these steps, we see that standard work is both the beginning AND the end of the kaizen process cycle. Not only is standard work required to begin kaizen, we also need standard work to finish kaizen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How many kaizen events do we conduct where establishing the new standard work is not completed by the end of the event? Does our activity to document the new standard work normally end up on our homework list? What happens to our kaizen if the new standard work is not documented?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Documented standard work is just a simple written description (with pictures) of the safest, highest-quality and most efficient way known to perform a given task or process. It is best written by the associates who actually perform the task and should be written in the most direct and simplest form possible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How many tasks and processes do we perform daily where there is no documented standard work? How many of the tasks or processes have changed while our documents remain the same, making them outdated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In my experience, we do not place enough emphasis on documenting the new standard work in our kaizen event process, so we easily backslide. The result is still the same. If you donât document the improvements into new standard work, there is no kaizen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;About the author:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mike Wroblewski started his lean journey with instruction in quick die change from Shigeo Shingo.

            <title>The kaizen 30-day homework list</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;At the end of a fast-paced, energy-draining, week-long kaizen event, despite all the improvements achieved, our teams always end up with tasks that they did not complete during the event. Even with a well-defined scope and dedicated kaizen team, some items from our kaizen newspaper still remain open. During the kaizen âreport outâ, these items show up on our kaizen 30-day homework list.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SOP-Wi3XgdI/AAAAAAAAAHw/g7LwVCWV2s0/s1600-h/Project_Schedule_Dog.jpeg"&gt;&lt;IMG height=320 alt=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SOP-Wi3XgdI/AAAAAAAAAHw/g7LwVCWV2s0/s320/Project_Schedule_Dog.jpeg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_homework_clip_image001.jpg" width=251 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some things to think about â¦&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are kaizen 30-day homework lists considered good or bad?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can we complete a kaizen event without having a 30-day homework list? Should we?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What does this say about the effectiveness of our kaizen event?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What items are allowed to end up on the list?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we intentionally leave items off?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we put the same high level of energy and focus on completing the 30-day homework list as we put forth during our kaizen event itself?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do we follow-up on the 30-day homework list?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are homework items tracked, measured and reported?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Are people held accountable? Donât blame the dog!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do homework items get done?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How can we improve our 30-day homework process?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do certain items habitually find themselves on our homework list? Is there a pattern?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What resources can we dedicate or make available during the event to help reduce the number of items ending up on the homework list?&lt;BR&gt;What can we learn from our kaizen 30-day homework list?&lt;BR&gt;These questions are food for thought. Let me know your ideas on this subject.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Quick change using a kaizen team and a good plan</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=left&gt;How many kaizen team members does it take to change a conveyor?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Good question. At one of Batesville Casket Companyâs kaizen events recently in Batesville, Ind., we found out the answer. It took the whole team of 11 members in pit crew style just under 29 minutes to change a conveyor track.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Our event was focused on adding different casket models on to our main assembly line and attempted to make the changes without a disruption to production, hence the 29-minute goal. Goal success meant completing the project during the assembly departmentâs 30-minute lunch period.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;A href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SMBa3CFOFuI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/piOSpxYt_1Q/s1600-h/Kaizen+Team+Pit+Crew+2.jpg"&gt;&lt;IMG height=320 alt=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SMBa3CFOFuI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/piOSpxYt_1Q/s320/Kaizen+Team+Pit+Crew+2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_kaizen2_clip_image001.jpg" width=240 border=0&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Photo 1. The plant kaizen team beat the clock by changing a conveyor in 29 minutes.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;With the planning and precision of a professional pit crew team, our kaizen team planned out all the elements of the change and staged all the material and tools. The team utilized basic SMED (single minute exchange of dies) principles.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Once the buzzer blared signaling the start of the lunch break, the kaizen team jumped into action. Despite the close quarters and a couple of uncooperative fasteners, the kaizen team successfully completed the conveyor change as the line associates returned from lunch to start the line back up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;This was truly kaizen in action.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;DIV class="watch-video-desc description"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"Kaizen Blitz" is a parody of the song&amp;nbsp;"Ballroom Blitz" by Sweet. If you've ever worked for a company that has kaizen events (also know as kaizen blitzes), you should get a few chuckles out of this. Even if you don't know what the heck a "Kaizen Blitz" is, you still might enjoy this. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;

            <title>How to survive a kaizen event</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A kaizen event is a focused effort to âmake a leap.â A cross-functional team is created. For a three- to five-day period, team members focus on improving a process. A kaizen event differs from regular, continuous kaizen improvement.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is characterized by the following: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A short burst of intense activity and effort (three to five days only) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Biased toward action over analysis to achieve improvements in a short time &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Focused on defining activities, improving supplier/customer connections and achieving flow &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Driven to resolving a specific problem or achieving a specific goal &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Committed to a specific area or process (either plant or office) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Guided with daily reviews of progress &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Managed to resolution &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A kaizen is guided by two imperatives:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Continuous improvement &lt;BR&gt;- Waste elimination &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During a kaizen event, the team will:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Identify opportunities and areas of waste&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ask âWhy?, Why?, Why?, Why?, Why?â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Determine ways to fix the problem or eliminate the waste&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Implement solutions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have been given the task of leading a kaizen event, here are 48 steps to take you from start to finish.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have gifts for team members bundled with the name tag attached ready to hand out.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make the opening a welcome to remember.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have event documentation team ready to capture action.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Take pictures of team members and post them in the main gathering area with their names.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have the names of event support staff and pictures displayed with contact information.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have a contact number (outside of the event staff) so that teams can be contacted; leave a roster with the switchboard of names of people in the event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make the comfort stations workable for the team rooms â coffee, water, soda, snacks.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Keep supply request lists available â regular supply runs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have members bring their favorite pencil, clipboard, stopwatch.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have a video camera, tapes and a digital camera available for each team, with instructions for running each clearly identified.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Assign a host non-team member for each group: questions, regular check-ins, what-ifs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Leave one evening open â 12-hour days with the same people are long enough.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Provide transportation options, company or cab service.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Start the event when all of the staff is in house; allow for some lag time with planes and trains and automobiles.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Wireless Internet and printer access in work areas is a great help.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Local color â see it through the eyes of your guests (shuttle service if necessary).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have the forms printed out, bundled by day and the report-out books indexed with tabs ready.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Set the shell of the file that you want each team to use at the ready (electronic/network file system).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Add the ârules in useâ to the top of observation forms.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make a point of names and dates on each and every form.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make rulers, tape measures, tape, post-its, easel boards a part of report-out stock kits.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Post in the host facility a notice explaining the event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Keep the facility employees in the loop.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Send out the forms in an e-mail ahead of time â visual identification tools and study guide&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Post locations of first-aid kits, aspirin, tweezers, Band-Aids, etc., or stock them in the work rooms.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lunch with non-event members adds local flavor and communicates the event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Non-event members could be observers, half-day or more; this provides lean exposure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Keep teams on time â report-outs are scheduled, start when they are scheduled, do not allow stragglers .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make plug-in coolers available; check with local vending companies, stock may be maintained by them.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is language a communication challenge? Learn a welcoming phrase prior to the event and perhaps some background about the other locations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Provide team rosters, including location and title, to all participants.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Binder supplies to contain all of the work papers that are completed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Schedule extra trash cans and janitorial services more frequently.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Remind teams to practice 5-S in their work rooms â lead by example.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teams need to ask for resources not visible.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meeting host employees with the same job function outside of lean might lead to improved communication across the company.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Arrange downtime at least once a day to check in with home facility. You may use phone cards or e-mail stations to accomplish such communication.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Post progress for host employees to visit (pictures before and after).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clear the host facility team membersâ responsibilities for the week; they are unavailable for the routine day events.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Build your report-out books every day. Have the tabs with labels, index and clear sheets ready to fill at the end of each day. Make it part of the daily report-out.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If using a network for computer storage, publish locations and identify what each team needs to add daily.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Set a group to copy the team books, use good 5-S, and make the instructions clear and binary. Allow three to four hours to complete the copies for books (we made seven).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Team members contribute to final presentation; document instructions and give examples of information that is necessary.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Have twice as many clear sleeves on hand as you think you need (we went through more than 1,200).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Try to balance experience levels (both technical and organizational) across teams&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use one sensei (consultant) for each changeover team; having their support and leadership will aid in direction and flow.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Only one of our three teams completed standardized work; assign responsibility for tracking the vital elements.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;People with prior exposure to Kaizen forms need to step forward and lead in documentation completion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;

            <title>Air kaizen: Re-examining your equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Are you in the air business? I&amp;rsquo;m not referring to filling up tires, the airline industry, the medical gas industry or Michael Jordan shoes. My question is about the plain, simple air around us. To put it another way, do you press, push, drill, turn, paint, move or ship air?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For example, at one of our recent kaizen events, we found that we are pushing air at one of our presses. In this process, parts are loaded onto a feed table to the side of the press while the machine is cycling. Once the press finishes its cycle, the completed parts are automatically pushed out of the press by the new parts being pushed in from a pusher. The only problem is the distance or gap between the staged parts going into the press and the press opening is more than 24 inches. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of air being pushed as the parts travel across the feed table before they actually enter the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SFbpv4lraZI/AAAAAAAAAGA/i4Iz7g7ljvY/s1600-h/680320_96958261.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://bp2.blogger.com/_OPu--EUUVfY/SFbpv4lraZI/AAAAAAAAAGA/i4Iz7g7ljvY/s320/680320_96958261.jpeg" border="0" height="320" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_kaizen_clip_image001.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The countermeasure for air muda at this machine is really pretty simple. With a little help from our talented maintenance staff, we made a new mounting bar and repositioned a limit switch for the pusher to close the gap to less than 4 inches. The result is a 4 percent productivity improvement without purchasing a new machine or radically changing the method.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This machine was a bottleneck station and we were having a difficult time meeting our takt time, causing an overtime situation. This simple kaizen along with some other improvements got us back to meeting takt time.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We found similar opportunities on other pieces of equipment throughout our operations, resulting in 5 to 10 percent productivity improvements each time we did a little air kaizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a critical look at your processes to see if you are in the air business. How many of your machines are set up to cycle through air before touching the actual material? Apply simple kaizen to the process and work yourself out of the air business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>LAI kaizen event increases production efficiency </title>

            <title>Understanding overall equipment effectiveness</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a concept utilized in a lean manufacturing implementation. OEE is becoming a commonly utilized maintenance metric within lean organizations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="http://www.1stcourses.com/"&gt;OEE&lt;/A&gt; concept normally measures the effectiveness of a machine center or process line, but can be utilized in non-manufacturing operations, also.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The high-level formula for the lean manufacturing OEE is:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE = Availability X Productivity X Quality. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Abbreviated, it is OEE = A X P X Q.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âAvailabilityâ portion of the equation measures the percentage of time the equipment or operation was running compared to the available time. For example, if a machine was available to run 16 hours but was only run for 12, then the âAvailabilityâ is 75 percent (12/16). The four hours when the machine didnât run would be setup time, breakdown or other down time. The eight hours the company did not plan to run the machine is rarely used in the calculation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âPerformanceâ portion of the equation measures the running speed of the operation compared to its maximum capability, often called the rated speed. For example, if a machine produced 70 pieces per hour while running but the capability of the machine is 100, then the âPerformanceâ is 70 percent (70/100). The concept can be used multiple ways depending on the capability number. For example, the machine might be capable of producing 100 pieces per hour with the perfect part, but only 90 on that particular order. When the capability of 100 is used for the calculation, the result is more a measure of facility OEE. For example, the sales department may take an order for a part than can only be produced at 90 per hour, which negatively affects OEE.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The âQualityâ portion of the equation measures the number of good parts produced compared to the total number of parts made. For example, if 100 parts are made and 90 of them are good, the âQualityâ is 90 percent (90/100).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Combining the above example into the OEE equation, the OEE is:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE = 75% X 70% X 90% = 47.25%&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As you can see, an OEE of 100 percent would require a machine to produce good quality every second of the available time at its top rated speed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key to using OEE is in the analysis. For example, if the âAvailabilityâ is 70 percent, the 30 percent of time for breakdowns, setup and downtime should be analyzed for improvement opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The most effective use of OEE is to break down the losses into smaller buckets of âopportunityâ. A 50 percent OEE doesnât mean much without any detail.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The OEE goal depends on the process, setup times and order quantities. For example, a machine that produces 10 orders per day with a 30-minute setup time would have 300 minutes reduced from the Availability equation. Conversely, a machine that runs one order all day would only have 30 minutes of setup time. These facts make it difficult to compare two machinesâ OEE numbers. The value is in the analysis and comparison of a machineâs OEE in one period vs. another. The comparison may also become meaningless if the order quantities vary significantly day to day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Knowing the complete OEE breakdown, the opportunities for improvement become apparent. The largest opportunities should be improved first, working down the list until all opportunities are improved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The improvement opportunities are always in one of the following âbucketsâ.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Breakdown 
&lt;LI&gt;Setup 
&lt;LI&gt;Downtime 
&lt;LI&gt;Speed loss 
&lt;LI&gt;Small stops 
&lt;LI&gt;Quality &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE is an excellent way of communicating the improvement opportunities to everyone, including operators, maintenance technicians, sales representatives, engineers and managers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most lean manufacturing tools work together to create value in the system and eliminate âwasteâ. OEE is a prime example of this integration of tools.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many lean implementations begin with a concept called â5-Sâ and value stream mapping. The value stream map shows where the waste occurs in the system. OEE analysis can be applied at the point where the waste occurs. The improvement in the OEE number will take the use of other lean applications, such as SMED (setup reduction), TPM (Total Productive Maintenance), standardized operations and âkaizen eventsâ targeting specific areas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is important in a lean manufacturing implementation to use the correct tools at the right time. Many lean implementations have failed because organizations failed to grasp a deep understanding of all lean concepts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The tools should be âpickedâ based on the opportunities in the organization, rather than âfitâ into the organization. When an organization forces tools that donât apply, it creates chaos and credibility problems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OEE is a powerful lean manufacturing tool, especially when combined with other tools using an integrated approach. &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Kaizen planning and the real world</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;One of the keys for success for kaizen events is planning. All the tasks of setting the proper scope, selecting a good mix of team members, lining up support resources, getting the planned materials and tools, collecting all the relevant documents (standard work combination sheets, layouts, etc.) from the target area, organizing all the training materials, etc., can help determine the success or failure of any kaizen event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But sometimes, such plans crumble when they hit the light of the real world. As stated best by General Binford Peay, U.S. Army Gulf War leader, âPlanning is priceless. The plan itself is useless.â&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Last week at the Batesville Casket Company, we completed an outstanding kaizen event in our Chihuahua, Mexico, plant despite the fact that our kaizen event was not even close to our original plan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Letâs back up a bit. Last month, I traveled to our Chihuahua plant to accomplish a couple of items including setting the scope for a kaizen event with our plant leaders. We reviewed the target area, assessed the scope, calculated the expected results (target goals) and lined up resources, plus all the other planning tasks needed for a successful kaizen event. Everything was all set and ready to go, that is until the week before the event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the request of the plant manager, our target area was changed to a completely different part of the business to better support our strategic plans. Both events were seeking productivity gains and shop-floor space reduction; however, that is where the similarities ended. On top of that, the goals for the new target area were more aggressive (instead of looking at just one line, we increased the scope to three different lines), but all we needed to do was provide a blueprint for the recommended changes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, what do you do to be successful? Cancel the planned event or go forward as originally planned? Put the new target area on deck for the next scheduled kaizen event in order to completely plan it out? Switch gears and go full speed ahead with the new event without the benefit (luxury) of time to plan it all out?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We chose to adapt to our changing environment, switch gears and focus on the new target. Instead of canceling our previously planned event for the week, we just postponed it a month. With some fast planning, we altered the make-up of the team, quickly lined up some resources and boldly moved forward.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Last week during the kaizen event, we continued the same motto of âplan, then adaptâ. Instead of just providing the blueprint (layout and line balance), we experimented with some layout changes that did not required air or electric modifications on the first night. Based on this success, we convinced our guidance team to allow us to go forward with the real move. By mid-week, we moved two lines overnight and started them up on time and running to takt time the next day. The third line required additional experimentation that postponed the actual move until Friday. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The end result for all the teamâs hard work and flexibility was a 40 percent reduction in floor space and a 30 percent productivity improvement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaizen planning is important; however, our dynamic work environments demand that we are more flexible. The leadership skills required to be successful are the ability to plan quickly and being able to adapt once our plans come in contact with the real world.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How plant reliability affects a lean implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;As a plant manager for the past seven years, I had a unique opportunity to lead a lean manufacturing implementation in two separate facilities. The plants were similar in numerous ways. They were both building-products manufacturing facilities, both were continuous processes, both had roughly 300 hourly people, and they were both owned by the same Fortune 500 corporation. The important difference between the two facilities was that one plant had a relatively mature manufacturing reliability program in place prior to the lean implementation and the second was a typical North American plant that was highly reactive in its maintenance processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The outcome of the lean implementation at the two locations could not have been more dramatically different. The lean implementation at the reliable plant was powerful and transforming; the lean implementation at the non-reliable plant did not deliver long-term results. This article will discuss my experience in leading two separate plants and why I believe that itâs critical to have a reliable facility for a successful lean manufacturing implementation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Blitz events were conducted very similarly in the two plants. Whether they were 5-S events or kaizen events focusing on a process or problem area, they were typically three to five days in length, were facilitated by either a consultant or a corporate Continuous Improvement leader, and had roughly eight to 16 hourly employees engaged in the event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events in a Non-Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The blitz events in the non-reliable plant were tougher to pull together. The first real challenge was getting participants to participate in the event. Because the work days were tough and challenging in the reactive environment, most employees were reluctant to come in and work days in excess of what they were scheduled. Managers and supervisors sponsoring the event would often have to assign employees to work on the blitz event instead of having them volunteer for the project.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An additional problem with blitz events in the non-reliable plant was establishing a baseline of performance for processes. We wanted to measure the improvements made over the course of the event, but there were many times this was not possible because of equipment downtime or process upset occurring in either the baseline measurement or during the measurement of the âafter improvementsâ section. This always resulted in deflation for the participants of the event because âthe equipment messed up.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A particularly aggravating problem that occurred in blitz events in the non-reliable plant was participants getting pulled from the event because of equipment problems. Electricians, mechanical craftsmen and area supervisors were especially hard hit with this phenomenon because their skills were either needed to get the equipment back up or their expertise was required to juggle the production schedule or shipping schedule to react to the downtime. Needless to say, it was disappointing to the team when someone who had been in on all the discussions during the event would âget yanked out of the eventâ to go take care of the dayâs problems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Probably the most insidious and damaging aspect of blitz events performed in the non-reliable plant was difficulty in sustaining the gains made during the event. Because the workplace was so often either reacting to, or recovering from, a significant equipment problem, managers and supervisors struggled with executing the critical leadership behaviors that were necessary to sustain the gains that were made in blitz events. The eventual deterioration of the area or process that had improved was visible to both hourly employees and the managers. This would, in turn, reinforce the reluctance for employees to participate in future events because they felt their efforts were in vain. Management teamâs credibility suffered as well.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Blitz Events in a Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My experience with blitz events in the reliable plant was dramatically different. They were truly some of the most positive workplace experiences Iâve had in my 20-year manufacturing career. The leadership team enjoyed much more management credibility with our hourly employees. This was largely because of the progress that had been made in the prior two years with implementing reliability. Hourly employeesâ daily work lives had been deeply impacted by the improvements in machine condition and the operational stability that resulted. They were very aware that we had been implementing the principles of reliability and they were very happy with results even after the first year.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This credibility resulted in hourly employees that were much more eager to participate in blitz events. People were excited about the opportunity to impact their work lives in a positive way. We certainly still had the scheduling challenges of backfilling participantsâ normal job in some cases, but there were many participants whose jobs were not backfilled for the event because the stability of the plant did not require them to be on their jobs all the time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It made an enormous difference to have all the participants in the event stay for the entire duration. The team dynamics were much more positive; it was rare for someone to have to leave the event to âtake care of problems.â This allowed all the participants to own the results and, more importantly, own the changes made in the event so they could serve to maintain the improvements and give insight to other employees about changes that were made and why they took that direction.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the facility performed more and more successful blitz events, employeesâ willingness to participate and actually lead events became greater and greater because they saw the positive changes that were implemented and they saw the results being sustained.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The opportunity to create a kanban system in finished goods existed in both plants. Both had fairly typical inventory strategies in that the sites produced inventory to match a sales forecast or to react to working capital directives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There was a dramatic difference, however, in the ability for both plants to capitalize on the opportunity to utilize kanban for producing to actual demand by the customers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban in a Non-Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As previously discussed, machine conditions in the non-reliable plant were unstable and the resulting downtime made for frequent schedule changes. Often a machine breakdown would occur which would limit our ability to produce some products. As a result, we would sometimes have to run products that were not needed for orders simply because we still needed to produce products to hit gross production targets stated in pounds.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There was no way we could have implemented a kanban system to produce to the kanban signal. While we still provided excellent customer service as measured by order fill rates and shipping dates, this was largely made possible by having very large inventories that served as buffers to absorb the impact of a chaotic production schedule.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Kanban in a Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After three years of persevering in the implementation of our reliability program, our ability to produce the production schedule became extremely strong. At the encouragement of our Continuous Improvement leader, we designed a kanban system for one of our very popular product lines. There were certainly some formidable âmental challengesâ that needed to be overcome. When warehouse personnel and scheduling personnel have had many years of a cushion in inventory, the very thought of taking inventory levels down produced much fear that needed to be managed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the team was engaged and trained in the kanban concept and the workings of the signal for inventory replenishment were created, we simply started running the system. While there were a few tweaks of the system over the first few months, the facility quickly gained confidence in their ability to produce and work with the much lower resulting inventory levels.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On the front end of implementing the kanban system, we felt that improved financials were going to be the primary benefit because of the working capital reduction. In reality, while we saw the financial impact quickly, the improvement in working conditions for our warehouse staff became âthe big win.â With much lower inventory, we saw many unanticipated benefits such as the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Wider aisles for the forklift drivers to maneuver forklifts 
&lt;LI&gt;Less stress for the forklift drivers because they had more room to work 
&lt;LI&gt;Less product damage to finished products 
&lt;LI&gt;Less property damage because of better visibility 
&lt;LI&gt;Less investment in finished product storage costs &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We continued to provide high levels of customer service even with the much lower inventory levels.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The absolute key to this process, however, was the ability to produce the right products for our customers at the right time, and by having the production machinery reliable, this gave the plant the ability to produce what the schedule called for.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The experience of leading these two similar, but very different, facilities really underscored the importance of having a plant be reliable before implementing lean manufacturing. The cadence of execution that is learned by the organization through having equipment maintenance work planned, scheduled, completed and closed out becomes a cornerstone of organization discipline that is fundamental when the elements of lean manufacturing are utilized.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Kaizen: Lean manufacturing continuous improvement</title>
            <description>One of the most popular buzzwords in business today is the word âkaizenâ. It is a Japanese word meaning âincremental improvementâ. Kaizen was formalized by the Toyota Production System, which is now utilized throughout the United States as lean manufacturing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The term kaizen is often coupled with another word to create the phrase âkaizen eventsâ. The kaizen event is the term given to a highly focused continuous improvement event consisting of a team working together for a brief time period to solve a business problem. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The kaizen event could focus on any business opportunity. It could be a line redesign, SMED (single-minute exchange of die) setup reduction event, speed improvement, cycle time reduction, waste reduction or any other issue. Kaizen events are also conducted in service industries such as hospitals, banks and other non-manufacturing businesses. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A kaizen event is similar to a brainstorming exercise, at least in the beginning stages. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaizen teams normally consist of four to seven individuals. The team normally spends 100 percent of their time for a few days until the business problem or issue is solved or improved. The team often consists of a cross-functional group of individuals with either knowledge in the area of focus or working in a department which is impacted by the issue. For example, a kaizen event to improve lead time 50 percent might include individuals from sales, manufacturing, scheduling and shipping. The idea is for the team to be able to consider all views of the problem. A cross-functional team will be able to understand the impact of every decision on all other areas. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaizen events are normally conducted for significant improvement. The mission statement clearly states the expected results. For example, the mission statement might be to âreduce waste on Line 4 from 8 percent down to 4 percentâ. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is generally one piece of paper containing all pertinent information concerning the events, including: &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Mission statement with objective &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Team members, leader and management sponsor &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Current problem statement &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Resources required &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Expected completion date &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Results &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Signoffs &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The kaizen team generally meets first for instructions, brainstorming of ideas and development of action plans. Kaizens usually follow the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology. As the PDCA model suggests, once the actions are planned, they are carried out, checked and actions taken based on the results. The PDCA cycle is continued until the problem is sufficiently solved. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaizen teams should gather their own facts by observing the issues or problems for themselves. Observations show many issues that cannot be detected viewing reports and data. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the kaizen team has obtained improvement, most groups will give a presentation to management. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kaizens often result in new ways of doing job tasks or conducting business. Procedures, tasks, duties and sequences may be changed. It is usually necessary for the team to work with the affected positions until all jobs become standardized (another lean term). If the new process is not standardized, it is common for people to revert back to the old comfortable procedures. It often takes some time to obtain maximum improvement through practicing the new procedures. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some kaizen events result in more work being done with less people. It is important in any lean manufacturing implementation to not put people out of work. Most successful lean manufacturing implementations move people to the â5-Sâ or other work team until the company grows and needs them in other areas. As this process continues, a company will eventually produce much more product with the same amount of employees. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If a company reduces their headcount as a result of lean manufacturing and kaizen events, the improvement process will not be sustained. People simply will not work themselves out of a job, and certainly will not help a company eliminate their job. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is important to celebrate and share success from kaizen events. Donât forget to involve the people whose jobs have changed. They helped make the company better, and deserve to share in the celebration.

            <title>The kaizen chronicles: Data is like art</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;When you look at a painting or a sculpture, what do you see?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some art is simple and we see it for what it is, like a landscape or a person, for example. Other art is more abstract. Before long, we may focus on the colors, the media used, the texture or other minute details. Maybe we look for the artist intent, meaning or message behind the art and certainly we draw our own conclusions. We may even develop a story to go along with the painting or sculpture. Some art we fall in love with, while other pieces are just OK. And, there is some art that we may find a strong dislike toward.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People can see the same picture or sculpture and see different things. Just like with art, people can see the same data and see different things and derive different meanings. A-ha! Here within lies a barrier to improvement. While this diversity in viewpoints works just fine in the art world, it certainly makes kaizen more difficult.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just assumed once data is proven that the data becomes fact and everyone can move forward in agreement. It is a great way to overcome opinions people bring to the table. Add going to Gemba to the get the facts and we have a powerful method for kaizen. Facts are facts, right? Not so fast, my friends. It is not that simple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At a recent kaizen event, we wanted to make some process changes that would benefit our paying customers. But before we moved forward, we wanted to evaluated and address some of the potential process issues that would be barriers to this change. After multiple experiments and simulations, we obtained an excellent bundle of data for our kaizen effort which seemed to point us in a course of action. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At this point, I thought it would be easy to move forward when it happened. Holy Smokes, our data suddenly became art. Not everyone on the team looked at the same data and came to the same conclusion. More important, they were passionate about their viewpoint that caused disagreement between team members.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I also noticed that when our opinions run deep within us it causes us to discount or ignore data that tells us otherwise. I have learned that when data supports our opinion we accept it without much fight however when data is counter to our opinions, we tend to argue against the data. The main lesson I learned is that it is not about the numbers, itâs really about what the numbers mean. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/aFIoZjTjHnw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>It's not easy to sustain those kaizen results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do you sustain kaizen results? This is a common question that I get asked and an issue that we all deal with on our lean journey. We work hard at identifying opportunities and finding ways to reduce waste in our processes only to see many of our gains erode over time. How do we sustain our kaizen results?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are most certainly several factors that could affect our kaizen sustainability, however I would like to focus on just one. In my experience, the quality of our kaizen follow-up activities greatly impacts sustaining our kaizen results.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the case of kaizen events, it seems we do a pretty good job of working through all the issues, despite struggling during the week, and end up getting good results which, in some cases, can be amazing. In our team report out, we show the before kaizen condition and after kaizen results that were accomplished in the event followed by a typical 30-day homework list, maybe some lessons learned and a listing of future kaizen opportunities. We congratulate the team on a job well done and celebrate our success.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	At this point, the erosion process begins. Many times, we believe that job is done with our report out and celebration, moving on to new opportunities. We have lots of waste to eliminate, right?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But just ask the associates in the recent event area that endured the kaizen storm for the week if the job is done. Almost 100 percent of the time, you would get a big &amp;ldquo;Hell, no!&amp;rdquo; Some would say details, details, details, but that is the point. If we don&amp;rsquo;t follow up well and get these details worked out, erosion takes hold and results are lost.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Our follow-up efforts must be just as diligent as our activities during the kaizen event. That requires providing resources on a daily basis to resolve all the open issues from the kaizen activity. Be prepared that we may find that this takes more effort than the &lt;a href="http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/8904/kaizen-events"&gt;kaizen event&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t fall into the trap of waiting until the last week before the 30-day follow-up meeting to crash through the list in a frantic attempt to get it all done in one day. This crash-course approach almost always creates poor workmanship and weakened results.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If we think about it, this type of effort is more strenuous on our team than if we spread the follow-up activity out daily for the 30 days. Not only is the workload spread out (less burden), the quality goes up.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are a few helpful hints that may improve our kaizen follow-up:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Have a kaizen follow-up process:&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds silly, but some companies don&amp;rsquo;t have a follow-up process at all. Create a process that works for your company and use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Establish a formal 30-day follow-up meeting:&lt;/strong&gt; Try setting this meeting date at the time of the kaizen report out for approximately 30 days out, and stick to that date. This meeting should have a formal agenda.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Add a 30-day results column to the Kaizen Results Achieved sheet:&lt;/strong&gt; Typical Kaizen Results Achieved sheets have columns for improvement measurement (i.e. productivity, WIP inventory, floor space, etc.), before kaizen, kaizen goal, actual achievement and percent improved. Just add a column for 30-day follow-up to record what the improvement results were at 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Put one person in charge of the entire kaizen follow-up:&lt;/strong&gt; This could be the kaizen team leader, sub-leader or the process owner. Don&amp;rsquo;t just rely on departments or individual assigned to tasks to finish the job. One key leader should be assigned and responsible for the complete follow-up process.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Buy-in is still important:&lt;/strong&gt; We may have done a good job getting buy-in for the process changes by the people in the process during the event, but as things go south the next week, it is easy for people to give up. Work to remove their frustration and keep their buy-in.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Keep our presence in gemba:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaizen events are fast-paced and exciting. One of the most notable features is constant presence in gemba by the team during the week. But what happens the following week? From an associate point of view, it may feel like everybody forgot about you and you are abandoned, left on your own to make it work. Let our associates know that we are still there to support them after kaizen by staying in gemba.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) Extend follow-up past 30 days:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes our follow-up activities do not result in a stable enough process after just 30 days. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to add a 60-day or even a 90-day follow-up for activities and meetings.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8) Kaizen our kaizen:&lt;/strong&gt; Reflect on each stage and element in our kaizen process. What improvements can we implement to improve our kaizen process? Include ideas from team members and associates in the kaizen areas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With focus on our kaizen follow-up process, we have a better chance of sustaining our results. It just may take us a little more work after the kaizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/UHBq_-bISrM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>One goal plus safety works best for kaizen event</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A kaizen event should be focused on only one goal plus any safety improvements you can make to the process. Many times, I have worked on kaizen events with multiple goals only to see the team lose focus in the middle of the event or the team splitting up to work on them individually.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is not to say that multiple accomplishments canât be achieved during an event, only that a single focus is better to keep the efforts of the team on track. In my experience, a simple productivity goal works best for a kaizen event. This can be measured in time and/or distance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not uncommon to see a work-in-process (WIP) reduction goal on a kaizen event. Any WIP reduction should be a result of kaizen and not specified as a targeted goal to prevent teams from simply removing this inventory without process improvements. With actual process improvements, the need for excess WIP will be removed and the reduction will occur with better, sustainable results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With one focused goal, many of the brainstorming activities will be improved by increasing the quantity of ideas on one topic area vs. multiple ideas across a wide topic range. It forces that team to think deeper into ways to achieve a focused objective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for safety improvements, I recommend a small target of three to five safety improvements per team. This helps emphasize the importance of safety in conjunction with kaizen and may prove challenging in some processes. We should always work at making our workplace safer at every possible opportunity including kaizen events.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>New Shingo book examines kaizen, creative thinking</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Announcing a new hardcover Shigeo Shingo book, &lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;Kaizen and the Art of Creative Thinking&lt;/I&gt;. Once again, Dr. Shingo will amaze you. Along with Taiichi Ohno, Dr. Shingo co-developed TPS (LEAN) with his deep understanding of how to improve the overall process of production. Dr. Shingo reveals how he taught &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Toyota&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and other Japanese companies the art of identifying and solving problems. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Many companies in the West are trying to emulate Lean but few can do it. Why not? Possibly, because we in the West do not recognize, develop and support the creative potential of every worker in solving problems. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Toyota&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; makes all employees problem solvers. Shingo gives you the tools to do it.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;It is an easy-to-read, brilliant book!&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Dr. Shingo presents six unique models, the sum of which he calls the Scientific Thinking Mechanism. These frameworks allow groups to deconstruct problems and rebuild them into powerful improvement ideas. This concept is central to TPS and provides the necessary foundation for any Lean Initiative to be built upon.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Download a chapter of the book from: &lt;SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"&gt;&lt;A title=http://www.superfactory.com/articles/Bodek_Kaizen_Creative_Excerpt.htm href="http://www.superfactory.com/articles/Bodek_Kaizen_Creative_Excerpt.htm"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;http://www.superfactory.com/articles/Bodek_Kaizen_Creative_Excerpt.htm&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;âDr. Shingo was a master of kaizen, he had the scientific training and innovative genius to deeply understand processes and the humility to realize that he needed the operators to take ownership.

            <title>When and how to use kaizen events</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are reluctant to utilize kaizen events because such events take a team of employees away from their &amp;quot;real jobs&amp;quot; for three to five days at a time. Companies often choose to substitute kaizen events with projects assigned to one or two individuals. Because of a lack of perceived importance and a lack of substantial participation and buy-in, very rarely does this result in true improvement. In fact, it often results in organizations claiming that lean does not work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I encounter companies in this situation, I argue that the effects of a properly planned and executed kaizen event will pay for the perceived &amp;quot;lost time&amp;quot; of the participants many times over. In fact, their &amp;quot;real jobs&amp;quot; will become easier because they will include less &amp;quot;firefighting&amp;quot; and more productive activities since kaizen events will address many of the day-to-day problems with permanent solutions instead of Band-Aids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, I wrote about what makes kaizen events effective in an article called &lt;a href="http://www.emsstrategies.com/dd040105article.html"&gt;The Power of Kaizen&lt;/a&gt;. In this article on the subject, you will learn when kaizen events should be used for maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recall that kaizen events are focused three- to five-day breakthrough events that generally include the following activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Defining the problem/goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Documenting the current state&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brainstorming and developing a future state&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing a follow-up plan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Presenting results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Celebrating successes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This process works in a variety of situations to solve a variety of problems. Kaizen events are often planned using &lt;a href="http://www.reliableplant.com/Meta/Tags/value%20stream%20mapping"&gt;value stream mapping&lt;/a&gt; to target the right areas for improvement. What follows is a list of some of the problems that can be solved using kaizen events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Decreasing changeover time on a piece of equipment or process. Using kaizen, a team can improve upon the time to change over equipment using the SMED system, developed by Shigeo Shingo.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizing the workplace using 5-S.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Creating a one-piece-flow work cell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing a pull system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving equipment reliability through TPM (Total Productive Maintenance).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving the manufacturability of a product design.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving a product development process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving other administrative processes such as order processing, procurement, engineering change processing and other paperwork/information processing activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen events, however, cannot solve any problem within an organization. There are certain types of improvements for which other methods should be used. Process improvements (such as Six Sigma-type analysis) aimed at yield improvement and variation/scrap reduction are key examples. Suppose that a particular process has a first-pass yield of only 85 percent when it would need to be much closer to 100 percent to run in a one-piece-flow environment. If the process must be analyzed using experiments and statistical methods, it would make sense to utilize a team but not a kaizen event. To implement these types of improvements, a problem-solving team (or a Six Sigma team) that meets regularly over a period of time works better than a kaizen team meeting for five consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to utilize kaizen events effectively, it is important to understand the types of problems for which kaizen events should and should not be used. With proper planning, kaizen events can bring breakthrough improvement to an organization on its lean journey.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A letter on good and bad kaizen practices</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;I recently visited a contract electronics manufacturer with a striking capacity for kaizen â the steady improvement of every step along its key value streams. Dozens of kaizen events were being performed across the company to eliminate wasted steps and to remedy quality, availability, adequacy and flexibility problems in each value stream. At the same time, kaizen teams were trying to speed continuous flow and to perfect pull systems when flow was not possible.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The managers were pleased with their work and I had to admire both their technical skills and their enthusiasm for rapid improvement involving the employees touching each value stream. However, I noted that most of the value streams being improved were for products that had been launched recently. I wondered why so much kaizen was necessary.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Indeed, I pondered â as I often do these days â whether the kaizen effort was analogous to old-fashioned end-of-the line quality inspection in mass production organizations. Value streams for new products were being put in place without much thought to lean principles or much rigor in thinking through the details of every step and action. Kaizen teams were then inspecting the processes once in operation, finding them far from lean, and launching waves of corrective action.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Given that many bad practices had been built into the value streams, these kaizen efforts were necessary and highly productive. But why wasnât the organization performing lean process design as an integral part of the development process? And was the organizationâs skill in after-the-fact kaizen â that is, its talent for process rework â actually reducing the pressure for the hard conversations about lean process development that ought to be taking place during product development instead?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As Iâve reflected on this situation, Iâve wondered if the practices of Toyota and other lean pioneers have been misunderstood. Kaizen is an important activity at Toyota and involves all employees. But new processes launched at Toyota are usually extraordinarily lean to begin with and post-launch kaizen is a small part of Toyotaâs competitive advantage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The secret lies in Toyotaâs product/process development system that focuses on creating âprofitable operational value streamsâ â to use a favorite phrase of the late Allen Ward. These streams have been thoroughly âpre-kaizenedâ by examining every step in the proposed production and fulfillment process long before launch.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first step is to make sure someone is responsible for thinking about the whole process needed to bring a new product from order to delivery. By thinking about the production process at the same time the product design is being evaluated, itâs possible to optimize both.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second step is to lay out the process on paper and consider the different ways that it might be conducted. For new types of products requiring new processes it is particularly important to consider a number of different ways the whole process and each step might be conducted and to conduct simple experiments to see which way works best. (This is the process development analogue of the Set-Based Concurrent Engineering methods used to evaluate different approaches to the design of the product. Itâs also a key element in the 3P Production Preparation Process now conducted by advanced lean organizations.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The third step is to test any new ways of conducting process steps with simple prototypes â even cardboard mock-ups â to learn how well they actually work (another element of 3P). The knowledge gained from these experiments then needs to be written down and turned into the experience curves of the sort Toyota develops from experiments with simple prototypes of new products.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;(In fact, this knowledge is Toyotaâs great advantage in concurrently and rapidly developing new products and processes: At this point, most of Toyotaâs production processes are highly standardized and fully documented. Most new product designs only need to comply with well-understood process requirements to launch as smoothing flowing streams. By contrast, most organizations I visit have poorly documented processes with weak standards and little real knowledge of trade-offs in designing a process one way versus another. They will need a lean leap in consciousness and practice in order to catch up.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the best process is determined, which may result in changes to the product design as well, the next step is to finalize equipment designs and information management systems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, itâs time to develop standard work for every step in the value stream and standard management for the whole value stream. This includes a training plan for every employee, a plan for every part and a maintenance plan for every piece of equipment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If all of these actions have been completed by the start of production, the value stream should be very lean from the first item delivered. Kaizen will still be important, based on hansei (or reflection) about the performance of the process once operating, but it can start from a higher level in a more stable process so that additional rapid improvement is actually easier.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Itâs my feeling that many organizations are now ready to elevate their level of play. As I hope Iâve made clear, this is not by de-emphasizing the idea of kaizen, but by performing the PDCA process that is at the heart of kaizen inside the development process. This will insure that every new value stream for every new product commences its productive life as a very lean stream.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Given the steady reduction in the length of product lives, I believe that it will become ever more important to achieve âprocess quality at the sourceâ. Otherwise, the product may be ready to go out of production before process problems are ever addressed through kaizen as rework.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Best regards, &lt;BR&gt;Jim &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;P.S. â My thoughts about pre-emptive kaizen have been spurred over the years by the work of the late Allen Ward on lean product and process development. I hope you will find his thinking, described in the recent LEI publication âLean Product and Process Developmentâ, useful in your own thinking about moving to the next level of leanness. Please &lt;A href="http://www.lean.org/Bookstore/ProductDetails.cfm?SelectedProductID=159"&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt; for details on Allenâs insightful work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;P.P.S. â Let me add a final note on âlean grammarâ. While writing this letter about kaizen, Iâve been reminded of the jarring note I always hear when someone tells me they have conducted many âkaizensâ (meaning kaizen projects) in their organization. This jars because there are no plural forms for nouns in Japanese. Now that Iâve gotten used to this departure from English practice, I find I like it and itâs the convention I always use. For example, I find myself saying: âYou have completed many kaizen since I last visited.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In my view, every English speaker in the lean community should feel free to add the letter s to form the plurals of kaizen, kaikaku, gemba, kanban, obeya, sensei, shusa, muda, poka-yoke, andon, etc., if it feels right. But everyone should also feel free â like me â not to. Feel free to forward this message to suppliers, customers or colleagues who are implementing lean â or should be. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Research examines kaizen event success and sustainability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A study of kaizen events, now supported by the National Science Foundation, has been initiated by researchers at Oregon State University and Virginia Tech. The team of industrial engineering researchers has partnered with nine different organizations to identify kaizen event factors most critical to short-term and long-term performance improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Kaizen events are focused and structured improvement projects, using a dedicated cross-functional team to improve a targeted work area, with specific goals, in an accelerated timeframe. They most often are conducted in a three- to five-day workshop setting, although they may be somewhat shorter or longer in duration. Kaizen event teams apply structured process tools and human creativity with a goal of substantially improving the performance of the work area, process or product.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations report promising initial results from kaizen events, and proponents claim their use will also lead to the creation of a culture of continual improvement. Some organizations seem to be able to sustain improved levels of performance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many, however, find that within six months to one year, work area performance has degraded, sometimes even to pre-event performance levels. Both consultants and industry leaders acknowledge that even in companies where events are generally successful, unsuccessful events (for example, few significant improvements were made, even initially) are not uncommon.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kaizen event framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As part of the research at Oregon State and Virginia Tech, a framework for categorizing kaizen event processes was developed. It can be used to guide the design of kaizen events by helping organizations identify strengths and opportunities for improvement for both individual events and a kaizen event program as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	By evaluating the current maturity of organizational processes against the kaizen event framework, organizations can identify aspects of kaizen event design and management in need of improvement. In addition, by examining the practices of other organizations, leaders can identify specific ways to improve their own kaizen event programs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The kaizen event framework is organized around three categories of kaizen event processes &amp;mdash; planning, implementing and sustaining. A fourth category of processes &amp;mdash; organizational support &amp;mdash; relates to the management of the kaizen event program as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1.&lt;strong&gt; Planning&lt;/strong&gt; processes provide organizations with a clear priority and rationale for supporting the kaizen events that will have the most impact, and for establishing the initial scope of the intended outcomes of these events. Planning encompasses three critical process areas:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			a. Identifying candidates for kaizen events&lt;br /&gt;
			b. Selecting between alternative candidates&lt;br /&gt;
			c. Defining the kaizen event scope&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;Implementing&lt;/strong&gt; processes focus on a specific event once it has been defined. These processes are conducted before, during and after an event. The four process areas included in implementation are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			a. Preparing for the event&lt;br /&gt;
			b. Executing the event&lt;br /&gt;
			c. Conducting follow-up actions&lt;br /&gt;
			d. Deploying improvements more broadly following the event&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;3. Sustaining&lt;/strong&gt; encompasses performance reviews, dissemination of results and lessons learned and standardization of improvement activities.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;4.Organizational support&lt;/strong&gt; includes employee training and education, kaizen event program management and employee motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using the framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To illustrate how the framework can be applied, the research team analyzed a kaizen event in one of the nine participating organizations, focusing primarily on the impact of planning and implementation processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The organization is a secondary wood products manufacturer with multiple manufacturing locations. The organization began using kaizen events in this particular plant in 1998 and continues to use kaizen events on a regular basis, particularly within manufacturing operations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The kaizen event studied was focused on developing a floor layout for two new pieces of equipment &amp;ndash; a press and a glue spreader. The general location for the equipment was decided before the event, while the kaizen team was responsible for the more detailed solution (such as figuring out how to fit the equipment into the prescribed space).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The pre-work (planning processes) used to determine the approximate location of the new equipment ahead of time was one unique characteristic of this event. As a result, the team started the event with a general solution, although many specific details about how to achieve the implementation remained unspecified. This seemed to impact several aspects of event implementation, including team member assessments of autonomy.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Team autonomy was rated on a survey instrument developed by the research team. In general, ratings indicated that the team believed that they were given a moderate degree of autonomy, neither low nor high. However, team autonomy ratings for other events in the organization indicated that most other teams felt they had been accorded a relatively high degree of autonomy. The lower rating indicated that the team felt it had less freedom in designing the solution during this event than other events in the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Three survey measures related to implementation were evaluated before the start of the event &amp;ndash; goal clarity, commitment to goals and goal difficulty. Goal difficulty was rated relatively low by the team. Goal clarity and commitment to goals, however, were rated quite high. Goal clarity reflects how well the kaizen event team&amp;rsquo;s improvement goals are clearly defined, and commitment to goals reflects the team&amp;rsquo;s perception of the need for the specific changes targeted by the kaizen event.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It appears that the planning processes used by the organization succeeded in communicating the objectives and need for the event, even though they may have resulted in lower levels of autonomy and an initial perception of the team that the kaizen event goals were not particularly difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In terms of event execution, two interesting design factors were identified by the research team. First, only 2 percent of the overall time allocated for the kaizen event was spent in analysis/design, whereas 73 percent of the overall time was spent in implementation. Teams often spend much more of their time in design and analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Second, as a result of the goals of the kaizen event (work area layout), no specific structured improvement tool was used by the kaizen event team. While the goals set for this kaizen event did not have measurable targets, it seemed that the team members and facilitator felt the overall event was a success. In addition, the facilitator rated the quality of team decision-making as very sound.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Being able to spend the vast majority of time in implementing, the team felt their efforts were effective. The perceived lower levels of goal difficulty and autonomy may be important predictors of other human resource outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The research team measured team member attitudes toward kaizen events, skill development and the impact of the event on the work area. The team ratings for these measures indicated that, in general, the team perceived positive event impact, both on themselves and the target work area. However, in general, the ratings were only somewhat positive, demonstrating tentative agreement, suggesting there may have been further, untapped potential for improvement of both the target work area and employee capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using the research to better understand kaizen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	These results show that design and impact of kaizen events can vary even in organizations with a long history of success in kaizen event usage. They underscore the tradeoffs leaders must make in designing kaizen events.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In particular, leaders need to look at the relationship between goal difficulty and scope. For instance, the relatively small event scope and the pre-specified general solution seemed to help the team spend more event time in implementation vs. analysis/design. However, this design likely caused the team to feel they had less autonomy, and may have had lower impact on employee attitudes, skills and knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For events intended to rapidly implement improvements, small scope and pre-planning might be preferred. Meanwhile, for events meant primarily for training employees in lean concepts and tools, a larger scope might be better.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Although beyond the scope of this article, it is also important to consider what impact event planning and implementation decisions may have on sustainability of event outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Only by studying kaizen events across multiple organizations and across time can the full set of factors related to the planning, implementation, sustaining and support be identified. Through this research, managers can have much more concrete guidelines to help assure that their efforts will lead to both short-term and sustainable performance improvement.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lost in translation: Musings from a kaizen event</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;No matter how well you plan, prepare and perform, sometimes things just happen that you do not expect. Sometimes these things are painful and sometimes they are magical. And sometimes, things just get lost in translation. Kaizen events are certainly a great playground for the unexpected. More times than not, the priceless moments on a lean journey for me originate on kaizen events.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Last week, I led an office kaizen event focused on a key customer-related process that proved to be a great challenge to improve. The team was diverse in both functional responsibility and heritage. We had one team member from the Ukraine, another from Columbia and one from the Philippines. It turns out to be a great mix of talent and only one member had any previous kaizen event experience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The first morning, we drill through some lean basics to introduce the kaizen approach. We cover a fair bit of information, which included seeing muda (waste) to eliminate it. Of course, I stressed that the true learning will be at gemba (the actual place) with discovery and learn-by-doing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At first, the kaizen team members were a bit on the shy side, but by the end of the morning, they were a quite lively group. I love the raw energy that a kaizen event stirs deep within us, along with large bits of anticipation and nervousness. By far, the best feeling is the huge rush of âanything is possibleâ as the team embarks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This entire team was extremely eager to start. I ended the morning session and asked if they had any more questions at this point and if they understood the next steps. After a few questions, I asked again, âWhere are we going and what are we looking for?â One team member yelled back with high energy and in complete sincerity, âWe are going to gumbo and we looking for Buddha!â A hush of silence. Then everyone burst out in laughter. It was a priceless moment. After wiping the tears from my eyes, the translation confusion was politely straightened out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By no means is this story meant to offend anyone of the Buddhist faith or to make light of religion. To be perfectly clear, lean principles are not focused on looking for Buddha in our process and eliminating it. It is muda that we want to eliminate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Upon reflection on this event, maybe we are looking for Buddha after all â only in the sense that Buddha can refer to âanyone who becomes enlightenedâ. Isnât the best place for enlightenment of our process found in gemba? Are we not seeking understanding before we can improve?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Epilogue: This team worked fantastic together during the rest of the week-long kaizen event and racked up more than 13 a-ha (enlightenment) moments. They reduced the process lead time 70 percent by Friday without open kaizen homework lists. Even with this huge reduction, the team sees more room for improvement which will continue the kaizen process. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Steal this idea: The Kaizen Wall of Fame</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=241 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_kaizen-wall.jpg" width=320&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Celebrate your employeesâ kaizen improvements by creating your companyâs own Kaizen Wall of Fame. While I visited Japan, I noticed that several of the companies proudly displayed all of the small improvement ideas from their employees. Itâs easy to do and can greatly benefit your lean journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;First, implement a small, simple kaizen. These are the small, common, ordinary improvements that we tend to overlook as insignificant or not important. An example would be where an employee added a recycle bin by the copy machine. Or another employee thought to eliminate a report that is no longer needed. To get a better understanding of the small, simple kaizen approach, I highly recommend that you read âThe Idea Generator, Quick and Easy Kaizenâ by Bunji Tozawa and Norman Bodek. This book does an excellent job of explaining the quick and easy kaizen approach.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Second, have the employee who created the improvement answer these three simple questions (just a short, single sentence answer per question is needed): &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;What was the problem? 
&lt;LI&gt;What was your idea? 
&lt;LI&gt;What was the result or benefit? &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Third, take before and after pictures to better explain the simple kaizen idea along with a picture of the employee. Make it personal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally, hang a laminated, color copy of the idea on the wall in your facility where everybody can see it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By posting the idea on the wall, you give instant recognition to your employees for making the improvement. You also encourage the small, frequent kaizen approach. Another benefit, you create a company-wide communication board to share all these ideas. Finally, it helps motivate everyone to join in the fun of kaizen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A side note, one Japanese company (only 200 employees) that I toured last fall will try to implement 50,000 of these kaizens this year. Your company may not produce quite that many, but I would still plan on using a BIG wall.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Hot-wash: Lessons learned from a kaizen event</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This afternoon, we completed another successful kaizen five-day event at an aerospace company in Indiana. The team was outstanding, the results were excellent and the kaizen event process was far from perfect, really meaning our kaizen implementation. Taking a page out of the military handbook, let&amp;rsquo;s look at this kaizen event for lessons learned. Our military has long utilized the process of debriefing, or a &amp;ldquo;hot-wash&amp;rdquo; from what I have been told, to examine the lessons learned on the battlefield or training session for improvement and evaluation, providing a critical review of one&amp;rsquo;s action. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned from this kaizen event.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1: Keep the kaizen training to what is actually needed for the event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I learned this lesson long ago, abandoning the idea of packing as much training into the event as possible to increase value to the participants. It makes absolutely zero sense to go into the details of a SMED system (single minute exchange of dies) if your event has no changeovers as an obstacle to improvement. Yet, I have attended kaizen events where the training package was a canned program for the full day, regardless of the scope of the kaizen event. Our kaizen event this week concentrated on throughput to the customer, so the training was only a half-day focusing on seeing waste, standard work and process flow. I spent too much time on some of the tools, time observation for one, which could have shortened the training time by 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2: Provide the kaizen training at the right time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many kaizen event training programs spend valuable training time the first day teaching how to complete a report out on Friday. By the time Friday rolls around, they end up teaching this portion of the training all over again because everybody has forgotten the lesson during the week. Sounds like muda (waste) to me. I only mention the report out on Monday morning, leaving the details for Friday morning prior to the report out. When Friday arrives, I bring the team together for the quick &amp;quot;How-to-do-a-report-out&amp;quot; session, and then the team goes to work without many questions. I think I did a good job on this one.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3: Properly scale the scope of the kaizen event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	How many kaizen events bring an elephant to the table for a small team of five people to try to eat in one week? Although we love a challenge and admire a team that tries to tackle a huge project, the size of the scope matters. Keep the scope in line with the resources at hand. Our project was huge, covering more than 30 process steps that encompassed more than 10 days of well-documented cycle time to complete one unit. It would have been impossible to cover all this work, so we focused only on the waste in between these steps, walking and waiting. This scale could have been examined in more detail prior to the event.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 4: Measure twice, cut once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After training on Monday at 12:30 p.m., our kaizen team was ready for action. Time to go to gemba. With data collection activities through Tuesday afternoon, the team had a workable layout ready for maintenance support by 2:30 p.m. A flurry of activity, with equipment moves and scouring the area for our needs, leads us to a transformed work area by 6:30 that night. Maintenance started without haste hooking up the new air and electric drops. The new layout was a tremendous improvement. Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But wait, the team started coming up with more ideas to try out. We asked the maintenance crew to hold up a bit while the team discovered the process of conducting multiple experiments to find the optimal layout. Only five layouts later, the team was satisfied with the results. Each of the five layouts shortened the distance traveled in the process, gaining an extra 5 percent improvement. Luckily, only a few of drops had any significant changes, so we did not completely tick off our wonderful maintenance support crew. Do not become satisfied with Idea A without trying multiple solutions (ideas B, C, D, etc.). You just might find a better way. Then, call in the maintenance troops to action.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 5: Do not tick off your maintenance support crew.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Please see above.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 6: Pick the right lean tool for the job and use it well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There are plenty of lean tools to choose for kaizen activities, so you must determine the right tool and use it well. In our case, the spaghetti diagram was the best tool. It was simple to use although extremely time-consuming for the large amount of travel in our process. The spaghetti diagram quickly showed the team the best areas for opportunity and was a great visual for comparison of layout options. Some of our time observations on the first day did not end up providing much help with our focus on the in-between process wastes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 7: Buy-in, Buy-in, Buy-in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Without the buy-in of the operators in a new process, the improvements of the week will not last past the Friday report-out. It is critical to get the process owners to buy-in to the new process. Of the five team members, we had one operator and one team leader of the process. All the other operators were asked for input and involved in the process of determining the layout each step of the way. Even with this high level of involvement, we had some unhappy campers. It took plenty of &amp;ldquo;please try it&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;what do you think?&amp;rdquo; before all the concerns were addressed. Several changes were not completely understood by those it affected, and several detailed changes were not discussed outside of the team before we made them. It may take patience and effort on the part of the team to get buy-in. To be successful, you have no other choice!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 8: Watch out for collateral damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Our new layout had a ripple effect. We took over an area belonging to another process and ended up swapping areas with them. We had a layout for our area but not one for the ousted department. We moved our equipment around our plan with precision and piled up the other department&amp;rsquo;s workbenches into our recently vacated area with reckless abandonment. Although we did provide air and electric to keep them running production the next day, they were not too happy with our thrown-together layout. We ended up spending time the next day fixing the mess we left behind. The end result was a much improved process flow for both areas; however, we should have spent some quality time on the layout of the other area up front.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 9: Keep your kaizen goals simple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many times, a &lt;a href="http://www.reliableplant.com/Read/8904/kaizen-events"&gt;kaizen event&lt;/a&gt; will put a long list of targets or goals on the team to accomplish &amp;ndash; productivity, cycle time, 5-S, floor space, quality, etc. All these goals are noble and beneficial; however, they may leave a team running in too many directions. Pick one goal to focus your kaizen team. Our kaizen goal was to improve the throughput of the process to the customer. We measured this goal with 1) time and 2) distance. Clear, simple and measurable. Good job!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 10: Go to gemba and stay there the entire week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With the exception of our Monday morning training and eating lunch, our kaizen team remained in our kaizen area the entire week. We had a meeting table, a few chairs and a flip chart placed in our kaizen area sharing information with the area (along with all those that passed by) throughout the kaizen process. Not only did this remove the muda of walking back and forth to an off-site meeting room, it also limited the team debates on the actual process. We shared information on display with our kaizen newspaper for all to see. No secrets, nothing to hide. Even the daily team leader meeting and the final report-out were conducted at gemba. In fact, our Friday report-out was attended by the owner of the company and his entire staff along with interested management from other departments seeing the actual improvements at gemba instead of relying on just descriptions of the changes in a stale conference room. Have the final report out at gemba; it will have a huge impact!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As stated earlier, the kaizen event results were excellent. We reduced the customer lead time in days by 36 percent and shortened the distance traveled by 68 percent (from more than 6,800 feet to 2,199 feet). The spirit of kaizen was ignited at this company and they are ready for more!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Can the kaizen process be improved? Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kaizen Event Implementation Manual now available</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) recently published a new book written by Geoffrey L. Mika entitled the &lt;I&gt;Kaizen Event Implementation Manual&lt;/I&gt;, Fifth Edition. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Originally used by &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Toyota&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, kaizen is a results-oriented tool that fosters continuous improvement. In the &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;United States&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, kaizen is usually an event of from three to five days in duration. It is comprised of intensive improvement activities directed at specific areas of a business. The main goal of kaizen is the elimination of non-value-added activities (waste) through the implementation of one-piece flow, working to takt time, and instituting a pull system. The mantra is to manufacture only what is needed by the customer, when it is needed, and in the quantities ordered. Kaizen has been shown to collapse lead times, dramatically reduce work in process, and reduce scrap and defects while minimizing the need for capital expenditures. Its successful results across industry are real, proven, documented, and confirmed! &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The first step to implementing kaizen in any organization is to provide training on the Toyota Production System (TPS). The &lt;I&gt;Kaizen Event Implementation Manual&lt;/I&gt;, Fifth Edition begins with this never-before-documented training material, but goes further to explain why the TPS tools, including kaizen, must work in tandem with a new way of thinking to bring about cultural change. By thinking "lean" and applying kaizen, everyone in the organization is empowered to eliminate waste, in all of its forms, at all levels, all the time. Flexibility, simplicity and the quest for constant improvement become the driving goals. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Revised and expanded in its fifth edition, the &lt;I&gt;Kaizen Event Implementation Manual&lt;/I&gt; has seen use in many industries for wide-ranging applications. It provides workers at all levels of an organization with a how-to guide for planning, organizing, and implementing kaizen events in any setting.

            <title>Energizer goes with the flow</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=264 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Spread.jpg" width=200 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global lean enterprise director &lt;BR&gt;Steve Hockridge (left) and lean coordinator &lt;BR&gt;Dana Billings have seen the benefits of &lt;BR&gt;bringing together lean and reliability.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are three types of manufacturing companies that implement lean: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it in name only to satisfy or attract investors. Lean is confined to buzzword status in annual reports and ads. 
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it on the surface. They construct a few U-shaped cells, paint the walls and throw out some clutter, then exclaim, âThatâs it; weâre lean.â Lean is a âhome improvementâ project for the plant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it right. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellPadding=5 width=200 align=right border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;Just the Facts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Site: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Energizerâs battery manufacturing plant in Maryville, Mo. The plant opened in October 1971, and has had expansions in 1973, 1978, 1980, 1993 and 1997. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant size:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Just over 500,000 square feet. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant employment:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The site employs approximately 500 âcolleagues,â including 94 in maintenance. It employed 50 people when it opened in 1971. The plant is not a unionized facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Products:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The plant manufactures batteries in the following cell formats: AA, AAAA, C and 9-volt. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FYI&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Energizer spun off from Ralston Purina in 2000 . . . The Energizer Bunny, the companyâs marketing icon, debuted in 1989. In 2000, it was named as one of the top five advertising icons of the 20th century.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Few fall into that third category. A recent report from QAD Inc. found 80 percent of surveyed companies said they currently have âa lean initiative,â but only 1 percent had documented lean practices in place. Not enough plant and corporate leaders take lean manufacturing beyond the surface level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not enough go deeper and view it as a valuable tool for the improvement of machinery reliability and the enhancement of total asset capability and performance. Robust and efficient mechanical assets are a precondition that lays the groundwork for foundational elements of lean such as flow and flexibility. Recognizing reliability as a key part of a lean transformation allows companies to better achieve goals that hit the bottom line â reduced inventory, costs, throughput time and work in progress, and increased quality, uptime and productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Energizer, the worldâs largest battery manufacturing company, can count itself in that 1 percent of firms doing lean the right way. Within a short amount of time, it has achieved incredible results through focused activities that push the envelope on people, process and production performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Every day, Energizer seeks to improve by bringing together lean and reliability. Just like love and marriage, its people know that you canât have one without the other. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have some very lofty lean-related goals for the company, but we cannot and will not achieve them unless we have reliable equipment,â says Steve Hockridge, Energizerâs global lean enterprise director. âYou canât improve labor productivity or achieve lead-time reductions or reduce inventory without it. You canât increase the speed at which you flow product to the customer if you have to account for equipment reliability issues that force you to carry buffer inventory. The only way to do all of that is by improving the reliability of your equipment to the point where itâs always ready whenever you need it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Joe Tisone, the companyâs vice president of global operations, concurs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn our business, speed and flexibility are key elements to success,â he says. âYou canât be fast or flexible with unreliable processes. If the machines donât go, we wonât have flow. Therefore, we view lean from a total business perspective.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This story will share some of the lean techniques that have made Energizerâs plant in Maryville, Mo., efficient and proactive from a machinery maintenance and mechanical reliability perspective. It will also serve to hold this organization and its people up as role models of flexibility, agility, ability, creativity and team-based solutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;MARYVILLE ROOTS&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Unlike some manufacturers, Energizer didnât make the leap to lean as a result of a burning platform. The company, whose history begins in 1886, was on solid financial footing at the dawn of the 21st century. After spinning off from Ralston Purina in 2000, its revenues, profitability and market share grew. But that didnât mean it was satisfied or complacent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-1.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive maintenance analyst Clyde Henry turned the plantâs oil &lt;BR&gt;drum repository into a clean, color-coded lubricant management center.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf you donât change, youâll be left behind,â says Tisone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Key customers such as Wal-Mart and Target continued to expect and demand more. Energizerâs longstanding competitors in the U.S., and emerging ones from Asia, exerted market pressure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the plant level, Energizer facilities that were built in the early 1970s, such as Maryville, began to show some age. As a result, machinery downtime and reactive maintenance work increased. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have done some very positive things over the past 25 years to take cost out of our products, but we did it in a traditional way, with large batches and efficiencies of scale,â says Hockridge. âIt may have been appropriate then, but the world changes and you have to adjust.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Energizerâs journey into lean â and the unification of lean concepts to machinery reliability â began in Maryville . . . and somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 2000, Dana Billings, the assistant plant manager for the Maryville site, became fascinated by the improvement principles employed by companies such as Toyota. Later that year, he began experimenting with 5-S workplace organization activities and had some success. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âDana kept nudging, pushing, prodding,â says Hockridge. âHeâd cut out articles and feed this information to Joe Tisone. Heâd send them with a note saying, âThis is stuff we need to get into.ââ &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tisone read the articles on an airplane trip to visit an Energizer plant in Singapore. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-2.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Each nail machine now features see-through doors, &lt;BR&gt;interior lighting and an external lubrication system.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf youâre flying to Singapore, you have plenty of time for reading,â says Billings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The information struck a chord with Tisone. He proceeded to read books on the subject, attend seminars and visit âleanâ plants. In November 2002, he traveled to all 22 Energizer sites around the globe and introduced lean to plant employees. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the initiative gained momentum and structure, Hockridge was selected to oversee its implementation on a global basis and coordinators were named to drive lean at the individual plant level. Billings became the lean coordinator for the Maryville site. These leaders helped shift lean from an âinteresting and intriguingâ concept (the kind that, through 5-S, was making introductory, surface-level improvements at Maryville) to a holistic approach capable of producing wide and deep benefits. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;THREE LITTLE LETTERS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reliabilityâs role in Energizerâs emerging lean program was not an afterthought. As lean was taking shape at the corporate level, Maryville introduced ACW. This three-letter acronym, short for autonomous care workshop, changed the way the plant and its more than 500 employees looked at production, maintenance and dancing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ACW began in June 2003, one month before the companyâs official lean kickoff. The first ACW took place in one of the plantâs molding areas. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe business was good, and we pushed the machinery hard,â says Hockridge. âWe wanted to do an event in this area to really bring these machines back.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ACW format is a blend of kaizen, Reliability-Centered Maintenance, technical education, root cause failure analysis and Total Productive Maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-3.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Operator Vicki Cady and mechanic Steve Piveral go over their &lt;BR&gt;preventive maintenance assignments in the nail production area.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;During a weeklong event, several maintenance mechanics team up with operators from a production area to jointly construct a game plan to achieve high levels of reliability for equipment in that area. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mechanics open a piece of equipment and talk to operators about its contents and how these components work, individually and as part of a system. They explain (and, in some cases, show) the signs of and reasons for component wear and failure. They also instruct on proper practices that prolong component life and ensure equipment health. During the process, operators convey their insights and experiences on this equipment to the mechanics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Together, they then identify defects in a machine, troubleshoot the root causes, and create mechanical and process fixes that greatly reduce the chance of failure. They examine current, recommended and rationalized preventive maintenance requirements and determine the best overall PM strategy. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Afterward, a plan is constructed to realize improved equipment health. PM checklists and standard work instructions are built. From this point on, reliability on a day-to-day basis becomes a joint venture between mechanics and operators. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThere used to be very tight boundaries between what maintenance did and what production did,â says global maintenance manager Joe Plagens. âWe wanted to create more of a partnership â a relationship and linkage â between these two organizations. What lean helps us do is have a setup where the operator takes on more of an ownership role of their equipment. They take on responsibilities to ensure its upkeep.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This isnât about sticking operators with a âto doâ list. This is about shared responsibilities and a shift in asset care strategy from reactive to planned and proactive. It is time-based and âorchestratedâ to maximize cooperation and task completion and minimize downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plantâs nail production area (a brass nail is a component of batteries) provides a perfect example. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each week, mechanic Steve Piveral and operator Vicki Cady jointly schedule the PM activities for the areaâs 15 machines. At the predetermined time, they meet to go over the standard work instructions for the operator tasks and the mechanic tasks. The instructions are sequenced, step-by-step, for efficiency. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe dance steps are orchestrated. Who is going to do what and when?â says Billings. âIn that choreographed activity called PM, it becomes a partnership. âYou need to do this so I can do that.â It becomes a whole new way of performing the maintenance dance.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On this day, Piveralâs activities (generally more technical in nature) are scheduled to take 10 minutes to complete and Cadyâs (cleaning, oiling and greasing) are slated for 90 minutes. When Piveral completes his tasks, he goes to a file of planned work orders for that machine. He finds the job or jobs that fit in the remaining time. Piveral and Cady complete the work, and get the machine running again. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI feel like Iâm more involved and more of a part of things,â says Cady. âI know how to do the lighter maintenance tasks. I think what I do helps the machine stay in better condition and perform better.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Piveral also sees the positives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI used to do 30 hours of PMs each week in this area. Now I have 10 minutes on each machine (15 machines) in three weeks. Thatâs 150 minutes in three weeks as opposed to 90 hours in three weeks,â he says. âThe hidden value in all of that is now I can do that planned work I could never get around to before.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This concept is widespread at the plant and instrumental in the push toward planned, proactive work. Four years ago, 20 percent of work orders were for planned maintenance; today, that figure is 60 percent and growing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âUnplanned maintenance costs us four times more than planned maintenance, so I guess that makes my job four times more important than it was originally,â says predictive analyst Rick Staley. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;KEEP IT SIMPLE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maryville employees believe they see the plant, and its machines, differently as a result of lean and reliability activities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have bright engineering minds here, and engineers can think in very complex and elaborate terms,â says Billings. âMuch of what we have is specialized equipment. So, with our background, we like to design or purchase machines that do 15 things before they spit out a part. Lean, on the other hand, teaches you to look at things in very simplistic terms. You want to simplify every facet of maintenance, production, quality, etc. Itâs been a transition for us, but I think we are seeing the light.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Complexity greatly increases the chance of waste (excessive motion, inventory, conveyance, etc.). It also increases the risk of unreliability (based on its sheer number of capabilities and components) and extended downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Engineers, mechanics and operators now re-examine individual machines, cells and entire production processes and look for simple, reduced-waste solutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âItâs all about separating the value-added steps from the non-value-added,â says Hockridge. âLetâs keep the value-added steps. But why do we have excessive equipment that loads the product into the process this way, or why do we have all of this extra conveyance for this process? Itâs waste. The plant used that thinking in one area and removed 30 pieces of equipment. The end product is the same. But the process is simpler and more reliable, and the quality is better. When you take out that much equipment, you increase your chance of reliable performance. Also, how many PMs disappeared at the same time? Weâre focusing on the stuff that matters.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This isnât an isolated example. Billings and Plagens noted a handful of projects that each eliminated more than 30 pieces of equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hockridge says this shows the importance of uniting lean and reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âDonât blindly start doing reliability or TPM first, because you know what? You may find that a piece of equipment isnât necessary,â he says. âYou need to integrate the strategies â lean and reliability.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By raising the reliability of the essential, value-added processes, and dumping the waste, the dream result is being able to physically link processes together (as opposed to having disparate processes that lead to excess inventory, motion, work in progress and transportation). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âYou can link unreliable processes together, but I wouldnât recommend it,â says Billings. âIf you link four processes together that are each 80 percent efficient, 80 times 80 times 80 times 80 does not equal 80.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The overall process is instead 41 percent efficient, and an emergency waiting to happen. Raising the reliability of those four individual processes to, say, 95 percent increases the systemâs total efficiency to a more acceptable 81.5 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âAnytime you have unplanned maintenance, youâre affecting the whole plant, not just the area where you are. But as we head toward flow, that makes it even more important,â says Staley. âWhen you start linking processes together, a breakdown has a larger impact.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;KITS, KAIZEN AND SMALL-K &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Maryville plant has sought out waste in non-mechanical forms, as well. To eliminate waiting, motion and transportation and increase wrench time, the plant turned to the lean concept of kitting in the past two years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Instead of a mechanic making back-and-forth trips to the tool crib to get the parts, tools and materials needed to complete a work order (that walking distance adds up in a half-million-square-foot plant), that worker receives everything he or she needs to do the task in one convenient package. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn doing spaghetti charts (following movement through a process), the breakthrough comes when you break through the paper because you traced over it so many times,â says Billings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MRO tool crib attendants such as Deb Hayes and Donna Wilson receive a planned work order from the maintenance planner. The attendant goes through the crib and compiles everything that is needed and then stages it all in a tote, tub or (if the job is large) on a cart. When the job is ready, the planner is notified. The job is then scheduled. The mechanic who receives the work order goes to the crib once to receive the kit and then heads to the job site. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Plagens says concepts such as kitting have been instrumental in doubling wrench time over the past three years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Waste reduction comes in many forms. Like many lean companies, Energizer is a heavy proponent of kaizen (continuous improvement) events. The battery maker has completed more than 800 weeklong kaizens which have contributed to more than $10 million in cost savings. It also is promoting small-k, short for small kaizen. These are simple, direct waste-elimination activities conducted by one or two workers. An Energizer plant in Indonesia is currently cranking out 500 documented small-k activities every month. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE cellPadding=5 width=450 align=center border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=subtitle borderColor=#ff0000 bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;LEAN LIVING&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Itâs been said that manufacturing professionals entrenched in lean activities think and see differently. Steve Hockridge, Energizerâs global lean enterprise director, good-naturedly says lean is both a cure and a curse. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI find myself thinking about lean constantly,â he says. âI go to places that arenât work-related, and if I see waste, it drives me crazy. I see it in the garage, in the restaurant. For a person like me who travels each week, going to an airport is an opportunity-rich environment for waste elimination.â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;VISIBLY CREATIVE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lean tools such as small-k serve to unlock the creativity of plant-floor workers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âCreativity is such a cornerstone and one that was masked by our traditional approach to things,â says Billings. âWhen people realized that itâs OK to think differently, that really opened the floodgates.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adds Plagens, âThe creativity to fix reoccurring problems is all in their hands. We want to generally increase the reliability on a machine or group of machines. What that group comes up with to get us there is up to them.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These ideas solve problems, increase reliability and make peopleâs jobs easier. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A glowing example is tucked in one corner of the building. This area was previously a repository for filled oil drums. These drums were stacked, waiting to be tapped and their contents used to lubricate machines. Few formal practices were in place at the time to store the drums or to tap and transport the oil to the floor. No filtering techniques were employed. The result was excess inventory, non-pure lubricants and an elevated risk of contamination. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Predictive maintenance analyst Clyde Henry developed the lean and reliable solution. He talked with vendors and viewed tons of catalogs. Drums of obsolete oil were removed, and excess drums of usable oil were transferred back to the supplier. Henry sketched and resketched models until he came up with the correct layout that would cleanly, safely and efficiently house the correct lubricants and related equipment. The repository became the lubricant management center. âWe want good, clean oil products going into our equipment,â says Henry. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe want to start from the inside out, making sure everything is clean and filtered, with no moisture or dirt, so that we can say that piece of equipment is running on 100 percent pure, clean oil. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe are now filtering the oil to 3 microns. We are filtering the water out before it goes into the equipment. We are putting oil in proper containers for our PM mechanics. We have a color-code system that is pretty fool-proof. We have color-coded our lubricant to the containers and to the machinery component itself. If itâs coded as yellow, it goes into our gearboxes, which also are marked in yellow. Itâs been a lot of work, but weâve come a long way in a yearâs time and really cleaned up this area.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Color-coding is just one of the visibility techniques used throughout the plant to heighten communication and eliminate miscommunication. Inspection points are numbered. Individual machine components are labeled. Gauges are taped to show proper and improper levels. Operators place tags on individual machine components to pinpoint problems (red tags) and opportunities for improvement (green tags). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-4.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global maintenance manager Joe Plagens and tool crib &lt;BR&gt;attendant Deb Hayes examine a kitting project.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Visibility tools send messages to mechanics and operators, but they can also work simply to increase visibility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The nail production area provides a perfect case in point. Each of the 15 machines is box-shaped, approximately 4 feet tall and stationed on the concrete floor. Originally, each of the machineâs four sides was solid sheet metal. You canât see through metal, so emerging problems such as an oil leak werenât noticed until the puddle meandered out from under the machine. If you needed to check or add oil to the lubrication system, the machine had to be shut down, locked out and a metal guard removed. The inside was dark, so a flashlight was always needed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The solutions were creative and plentiful. Mechanics installed Plexiglas doors on two sides of the machine. These allow mechanics and operators instant access to the interior. Permanent lighting was installed inside to provide visibility. Specially sized absorbent sheets were placed inside to not only catch oil drips but to visually convey that information to the operator or mechanic. And, the lubrication system was moved to the outside of the machine, so no shutdowns or lockouts are needed. Lubricant can be added on the fly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe can experiment,â says Piveral. âSometimes the idea doesnât work, but itâs no big deal. We just put it back to the way things were. Thatâs all part of it. Sometimes youâre right, sometimes youâre wrong, and if you were wrong, what did we learn from it. When it works, itâs tremendous. You know you had a hand in ensuring the reliability and performance of the machine.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;A TRUE 1 PERCENTER &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some manufacturing companies dabble with lean or fool themselves (and others) into believing that they are on the path. But there are other companies that are truly doing it the right way and making meaningful changes that allow their plants and their people to better face todayâs challenges and those of the future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are you in the 80 percent category or the 1 percent category? Itâs obvious where Energizer stands. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWeâve reduced the number of mechanics who fight fires or work reactively on the floor and increased the number who are focused on planned, predictive, preventive and proactive work,â says Staley. âWeâre using our resources in a different way and a lean way.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adds Tisone, âLooking back three years, where we were in all of our plants and where we are today, itâs 180 degrees different in terms of the ownership and the improvements weâve made in all processes. We have made great strides, but we have a long way to go. Lean is a journey; itâs not a destination. Thereâs never an end.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Like Energizerâs battery-powered bunny, it just keeps going and going. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;HOW DO YOU INCREASE CREATIVITY?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the socio-psychological studies are correct, your plant may have a problem with creativity. Energizerâs Steve Hockridge cited a recent research study that found only 5 percent of American adults are deemed creative, based on a standard evaluation measurement. The same study found 95 percent of pre-kindergarten children in the U.S. to be creative. The percentage plummets to 15 percent for first-graders. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is there such a gap?â says Hockridge. âThe explanation was tied to grades. Think about grades in school. What you are doing is grading people on how well they can tell back to you what you told them was the right answer. How much creativity are we encouraging by grading people based on that? âHere are the facts. Two weeks later, can you tell me what I told to you? If you can, youâre an A.â Thereâs no creativity there.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hockridge points to Toyota as a great example of a company pushing for creativity. âToyotaâs environment is completely creative,â he says. âThey encourage continuous experimentation. They encourage failure. Itâs all about learning and getting better.â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

            <title>Inside the Toyota MR-50</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent" is a lofty goal, but who is going to bet against this automaker?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=232 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-georgetown-plant.jpg" width=300&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Georgetown, Ky., plant makes the Camry four-door &lt;BR&gt;sedan, Avalon sedan, and the Solara coupe and convertible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How are your companyâs numbers? For comparison sake, here are some of Toyotaâs: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3 - its rank on the list of the worldâs most respected companies, based on the results from a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers and Financial Times poll. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;5 - its rank on the list of the worldâs most admired companies (No. 1 among automobile manufacturers), as selected by 10,000 executives in a survey by Fortune magazine. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;6 - its rank in Harris Interactiveâs study on the worldâs best brands. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;10 - its rank in Harrisâ corporate reputation survey (again, first among car makers). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;10 - its percentage of corporate growth in 2005. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;13 - its percentage share of the global auto market in 2005. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;13.3 - its percentage share of the United States market last year. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;9.06 million - its planned production for 2006, which would surpass General Motors as tops in the industry. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But if you think those numbers are impressive or deserving of attention, consider this one: 50, as in 50 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;

&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The 7 Deadly Wastes&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After years of work to eliminate waste, Toyota identified the following seven types of waste as the most prominent ones: &lt;BR&gt;1) Overproduction &lt;BR&gt;2) Waiting &lt;BR&gt;3) Excess conveyance &lt;BR&gt;4) Over-processing &lt;BR&gt;5) Excess inventory &lt;BR&gt;6) Unnecessary motion &lt;BR&gt;7) Defects and corrections&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent, or MR-50, is the latest in a long line of Toyota initiatives aimed at eliminating waste and inefficiency in its automobile plants. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At most companies, those four words â Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent â would incite panic. However, to understand MR-50, and what it is and isnât, you must know all the details, and you must know Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=187 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-kentucky.jpg" width=291&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky (TMMK) &lt;BR&gt;employs approximately 7,000 workers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Great Expectations &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;High expectations are a key part of the Toyota corporate culture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Teruyuki Minoura, the president and CEO of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) from 1998 to 2002, once stated, âItâs a basic characteristic of human beings that they develop wisdom from being put under pressure.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More recently, Atsushi Niimi (TMMNA president/CEO from 2002 to 2005) pressed for high returns when he rolled out Global Body Line, an initiative aimed at increasing production line flexibility. During a keynote address at the 2004 National Manufacturing Week trade show, Niimi proudly reported a 50 percent savings in the cost to put in a new body line and 50 percent space savings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With that as the backdrop, itâs not surprising that maintenance and reliability leaders at Toyotaâs plant in Georgetown, Ky. â the companyâs largest site in North America in terms of size, employment and output â were unfazed when the company requested that its well-established plants pursue a 50 percent maintenance reduction over the next few years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=208 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-maint-leaders.jpg" width=288&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota maintenance leaders Ed Welch (left), David &lt;BR&gt;Absher and Bruce Bremer.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMR-50 is just an acronym,â says Ed Welch, the maintenance manager at the plant, known as Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky (TMMK). âItâs a challenge and a matter of emphasis.â The emphasis is pure Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, it is Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent, not Cost Reduction 50 Percent or Employee Reduction 50 Percent. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âThe goal is to reduce maintenance activities and the maintenance that you perform on a machine by 50 percent. That goal covers every machine and every activity,â says TMMK facilities control manager David Absher. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is not about arbitrarily chopping budgets or personnel. Itâs a game plan that balances todayâs corporate wants and needs with long-term implications and vision. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;

&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Just the Facts&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Site&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. (TMMK), in Georgetown, Ky. Toyota Motor Manufacturing North Americaâs headquarters is located in nearby Erlanger, Ky. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TMMK employment&lt;/STRONG&gt;: approximately 7,000, including 710 in maintenance. &lt;BR&gt;Site size: 7.5 million square feet spread out over 1,300 acres. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Products&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Camry four-door sedan, Avalon sedan, and Solara coupe and convertible; also, four-cylinder and V6 engines, axles, steering components, machined blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies, and dies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Production&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In 2005, the site produced 492,889 vehicles (including 351,883 Camrys) and 498,908 engines. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FYI&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Production began in July 1988; the site made its 6 millionth vehicle in June 2005.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bruce Bremer, the facility engineering manager stationed at Toyotaâs North American manufacturing headquarters in nearby Erlanger, Ky., aligns it with the basic principles of the Toyota Production System. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMR seeks out anything in the organization that is waste or sets you up for waste,â he says. Welch gets specific and straightforward. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhereâs the muda (a Japanese term for waste)? Is it overtime? Reduce it. Is it your indirect material costs? Find out why your costs are higher than the benchmark and find ways to reduce them,â he says. âSpare parts, downtime, planning and scheduling â identify the waste, then go after it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But is a 50 percent reduction in maintenance realistic, let alone possible? Consider your own activities and determine if half of them are unnecessary. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=301 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-identify-waste.jpg" width=204&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota has a long history of initiatives &lt;BR&gt;aimed at identifying waste and &lt;BR&gt;inefficiency. If a process or an activity &lt;BR&gt;(in maintenance, production, etc.) does &lt;BR&gt;not add value, it is targeted for elimination.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âIt may be an impossible dream, but you donât know unless you try,â says Absher. âOur mind-set is to be aggressive. We donât go into anything with the attitude that this is the best we can or could do. If you donât have aggressive goals, how do you determine success? Did you get the maximum out of the initiative? Who knows? We set really high targets and then try like crazy to get there. If we donât reach a target, we try to figure out why we fell short. What stopped us? Is there anything we can do to take it another step?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While itâs apparent what the M in MR-50 stands for, these leaders explain that this is not a âmaintenance initiative.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âEveryone is involved with it,â says Absher. âOur people hate waste â waste of motion, all of the seven deadly muda (see sidebar on page 10). Itâs like we have 7,000 industrial engineers working here. They see waste, and they know how to fix it.â&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.practicingoilanalysis.com/cgi-bin/redirect.exe/0.08011634217857527"&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Shunning the S &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before this article continues, you need to understand that these concepts and the ones that follow are not for the weak-willed. More importantly, you must understand that these concepts are applicable to you and your plant, not just Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI am surprised by folksâ perceptions of us,â says Welch, explaining that outsiders hold the company and its people up as manufacturing Supermen. âWeâre the same humans that are down the street. I donât think weâre that different than most American manufacturing facilities. We have the same bureaucracy, the same frustrations that most companies do.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Absher also shuns an elite label for his plantâs 710-person maintenance crew. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI donât know if I am in a position to offer any advice because, frankly, there are many companies out there that are really, really good at maintenance. They are a lot better than we are,â he says. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=223 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-reduction-percentage.jpg" width=350&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintenance Reduction 50 Percent is not a âmaintenanceâ initiative . &lt;BR&gt;It involves all plant employees.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Absher and Bremer cite Eli Lilly, National Starch, Alcoa and Harley-Davidson as maintenance role models for a variety of reasons. For example, they tout Alcoa for its long-range planning capabilities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What makes Toyota different than other companies is culture and how the maintenance department applies an assortment of tools from the Toyota Production System. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Kaizen Culture &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most companiesâ plants, perhaps even yours, thrive and function on the principle of history. âOur original manager in this area put that process in place.â âWe won a best plant award in our state in 1991.â âWeâve always done it that way.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota discourages such rear-view thinking. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Taiichi Ohno, the companyâs former executive vice president and the man credited with developing the Toyota Production System, once said: âSomething is wrong if workers do not look around each day, find things that are tedious or boring, and then rewrite the procedures. Even last monthâs manual should be out of date.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Employees are encouraged, even expected, to shake things up and seek a better way. This system of all-hands continuous improvement is called kaizen. It is applicable for anything from bottlenecks to neck soreness to soaring energy costs and everything in between. Kaizen activities seek to identify and eliminate waste, while also striving to ensure quality and safety. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=228 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-ims.jpg" width=150&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Toyota is a cutting-edge, &lt;BR&gt;high-tech leader. That will &lt;BR&gt;continue with the adoption &lt;BR&gt;of predictive technologies &lt;BR&gt;such as intelligent &lt;BR&gt;maintenance systems (IMS).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âWe donât accept the situation,â says Absher. âWe have the kaizen mind and we work toward continuous improvement. Everyone does. My job is equal to work plus kaizen. Itâs not just the work. Itâs thinking about improving whatâs going on.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are no sacred cows. Employees are encouraged to ânot be afraidâ and to âchallenge the norm.â Problem-solving skills are honed to handle these tasks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Stopping Short &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The kaizen mind-set is most visible in formal kaizen events. These projects bring together a cross-functional team of individuals for a week to three weeks to find solutions to a high-priority problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a tool utilized in many American plants, perhaps even yours. At TMMK in Georgetown, maintenance personnel play key roles on production-led kaizens. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âThat is the perfect situation, a great way to work together, and I encourage that,â says Welch. âMaintenance members have their finger on the pulse of plant manufacturing issues. Their skills are put to good use.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For instance, production workers sought to address an ergonomic issue on the Solara line. During the assembly process for this two-door coupe, operators who work under the car in a pit had to manually open and close each of the heavy doors 150 times a day. The process was physically taxing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance team members designed, fabricated, programmed and implemented a very basic device that used a pneumatic cylinder to close the door when the operator hit the complete button. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=4 width=400 align=center border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The Roots of MR-50&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to TMMK facilities control manager David Absher, MR-50 started as a quality circle project in Japan. This particular quality circle group of Toyota team members reviewed the maintenance procedures on a single piece of equipment, a compressor. The project wound up reducing maintenance on that compressor by 50 percent. The title of the groupâs subsequent presentation was âMR 50 Percent.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota corporate leaders were impressed by the project and felt this thought process could be applied to all plant equipment. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The MR-50 message eventually was delivered to all Toyota plants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For maintenance crews at most U.S. plants, this is where the kaizen process stops. Very few incorporate kaizen and other Toyota Production System (you may call it lean manufacturing) tools internally to address their own wastes and inefficiencies. They also fail to use them to troubleshoot problems or to create strategies for optimal machine reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That P (production) in TPS (or the âmanufacturingâ in lean manufacturing) is often hard to look past. Even Toyotaâs maintenance organization had its difficulties. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLike many organizations, we struggled in trying to take the TPS message from production into maintenance,â says Welch. âWe got stuck, and we still get stuck at times, trying to turn âproduction-based toolsâ into maintenance tools.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But the utilization of TPS components and other optimization strategies is what these leaders feel will make the difference in MR-50 and the drive to reduce maintenance activities by 50 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What follows is an explanation of the traditional and non-traditional tools that the maintenance organization at TMMK and other Toyota plants has at its disposal. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;The MR Toolbox &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintenance-focused kaizen:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Production has problems that can be solved by creative team thinking, but maintenance does, too. The key is to use the available time and energy on kaizen events that address meaningful issues. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âWe use data for all of our analyses,â says Bremer. âWe have key performance indicators that look at downtime, energy usage, reliability, costs and much more. That information will tell you where you need to focus your time.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, Welch and Absher recently assembled groups for events related to spare parts reduction and duplication, servo driver axis wear in robots, planning and scheduling, electrical fault response, and identifying a stronger global CMMS solution. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSpare parts has traditionally been a tough nut to crack,â says Welch. âIf we can commonize equipment designs, we can get to the point where the design that one person builds uses the same cylinder as the design that I build.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Absher lauds the maintenance reduction result from the fault response event in facilities control. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe found that, on average, we experienced a fault on the bus duct in the plant every nine months that typically took 2.7 hours to repair and affected production in the area where the fault occurred,â he says. âWe did a tremendous amount of problem solving, and when we were convinced we had done everything we could to prevent the faults, we determined we would do everything we could to minimize the impact. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=267 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-georgetown-plant2.jpg" width=175&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In 2005, the Georgetown plant &lt;BR&gt;produced 498,908 engines.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;âWe developed procedures for an electrical bus duct fault response and practiced them with every team until we got the procedure and the teams to a point where they could correct the fault condition and have a bus back on line in 0.9 hours. This was a 66 percent reduction. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe then developed an electrical system breakdown cart. The cart has everything in it that we determined, through our examination and through dry runs, was necessary to correct and restore the condition. It also has everything necessary to change fuses on the bus and to troubleshoot and operate a distribution system breaker.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;While kaizen events are finite in length, consortiums allow for continual examination of specific issues as well as standards development. Water quality, electrical equipment, welding and energy are some of the active consortiums. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Toyota is exploring the application and feasibility of intelligent maintenance systems. IMS predict and forecast equipment performance so that ânear-zero breakdownâ status is achievable. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data comes from two sources: sensors (mounted on the machine to gather information) and the entire enterprise system (including quality data, past history and trending). By correlating data from these sources (current and historical), itâs possible to predict future performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Toyota has been a financial contributor to the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems program at the University of Cincinnati and the University of Michigan. As a result, TMMK serves as a testbed site for this groundbreaking technology. Activities currently center on air compressor efficiency, robot health and bearing monitoring. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThatâs a nice marriage of academia and manufacturing,â says Welch. âSome of the problems that weâre working on now arenât our top-10 problems because academia does not move at that rate. They are researching much deeper.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He says the alliance is still in its infancy, and that practicality and cost-effectiveness will dictate expansion and overall incorporation of next-generation IMS technology. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âPredictive maintenance will be wonderful, and that is something in the future,â he says. âBut even if we found a predictive tool, could it be cost-effective? Two-thousand robots, seven joints each: Thatâs 14,000 sensors that we would need to put on if weâre going to look at those robot joints. So, how far do you go?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Five-whys:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This simple problem-solving technique helps users get to the root of a problem quickly. The strategy involves looking at any problem and continually asking âWhy?â and âWhat caused this problem?â The answer to the first âwhyâ will often prompt another âwhy.â The answer to the second âwhyâ will prompt another, and so on. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âYouâll find the root cause, and if you can get rid of that, it will never happen again,â Ohno is quoted as saying. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An equally relevant Minoura quote goes, âIf you incorporate all the accumulated knowledge of root causes that youâve got from always asking âWhy? Why? Why?â into your equipment, youâre going to have something that no one else can come close to.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Five-whys, root cause analysis and Reliability-Centered Maintenance are all used by TMMK to determine the appropriate level and method of maintenance for a given plant asset. They also allow the organization to direct limited resources to where they will have the greatest effect. For instance, facilities decided to let roof exhaust fans run to failure rather than regreasing the bearings and replacing the belts. Resources were redirected to chiller maintenance, an endeavor with bigger total cost implications. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Heijunka:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Toyota defines this as the overall leveling, in the production schedule, of the volume and variety of items produced in given time periods. However, heijunka is easily applied to maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Focus on leveling. Maintenance workloads are famous for their peaks and valleys. Through proper planning and scheduling, workloads can be leveled, reducing overtime as well as inactivity. The creation of standardized work and the breakdown of large projects into smaller ones are good ways to reduce time blocks and to level the peaks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âRather than planning a huge PM once every six months, break it into very small increments that you can standardize and do on a daily or weekly basis,â says Absher. âWhen you do that, you can truly achieve heijunka.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bremer applies leveling to maintenance skill standards. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=131 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-workers.jpg" width=200&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inside the kaizen culture, workers &lt;BR&gt;identify trouble spots, figure out their &lt;BR&gt;root cause and then develop a solution.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=left&gt;âStandards are the base. They explain how something should be done,â he says. âStandards help a new maintenance hire quickly bring his or her skill level up to the level of competence of more experienced technicians. The goal is to achieve a consistently high level of competence for all technicians in your organization.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmarking:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As you may have noticed, humility and continuous improvement are components of the Toyota culture. To that end, maintenance personnel at TMMK and other Toyota plants are constantly on the lookout for best practices. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe arenât anywhere near excellent, but we are on that journey. We learn quite a bit by benchmarking other facilities,â says Welch. âWe are currently benchmarking our (Tier 1 and 2) suppliers whose reliability efforts are, frankly, stronger than ours.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;They benchmark auto plants and non-auto plants. They attend industry events to hear case studies, meet peers and take plant tours. They visit other Toyota sites in the United States and Japan. Some good âfive-whyâ thought occurs from checking out their Toyota brethren. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is that plant different than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy are their reliability numbers higher than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is their safety record better than mine?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Examinations are made to close the gaps. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Genchi genbutsu:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Good things come from walking around someone elseâs plant, but equal good can come from standing still in your own. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The practice of genchi genbutsu holds a colorful place in Toyota lore. Countless stories (real and embellished) tell of a new hire being sent out to the shop floor to âgo and see.â The person stands or sits in one place for an entire eight-hour shift and takes note of anything of importance. More often than not, the person pinpoints waste and issues related to safety, flow, quality, etc. But he or she may also identify maintenance issues. Perhaps a machine is making uncharacteristic, intermittent noises. Perhaps lubrication procedures are not being properly followed. Perhaps a technician needed to make numerous trips to the tool crib to complete a particular work order. Maybe an operator made improper adjustments to the machine. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In October 1935, five years after the death of Toyota Group founder Sakichi Toyoda, family members gathered his teachings and published them as the Toyoda Precepts. The precepts act as the core of Toyota management and guide the companyâs actions. They include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;Be contributive to the development and welfare of the country by working together regardless of position, in faithfully fulfilling your duties. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be at the vanguard of the times through endless creativity, inquisitiveness and pursuit of improvement. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be practical and avoid frivolity. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be kind and generous; strive to create a warm, homelike atmosphere. 
&lt;LI&gt;Be reverent and show gratitude for things great and small in thought and deed. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An eight-hour standathon is not required in this practice. The bottom line is: To know the problem, you need to see the problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Total Productive Maintenance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The benefits of TPM are well-documented. The more maintenance activities that can be shifted to the operator, the more time technicians have for productive, proactive work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At TMMK, operators are involved with tasks ranging from lubrication, filtration, calibration and minor repairs. In the weld shop, they perform the tip changes on welding robots. Overall, assignments vary based on operation complexity and safety. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOver the years, Iâve seen fewer tasks termed as âskilled work,ââ says Absher. âSkilled work has taken on an entirely different meaning because of the rapid advancement of technology.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visual controls:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This tool is closely tied to TPM. Basically, it is a method of visually conveying information. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Gauge taping is a simple example. Color-coded tape is applied to a gauge in pie-shaped sections to pinpoint levels that are proper (green zone), elevated (yellow) and high (red). A newly hired operator may know nothing about his machine, but he can draw a conclusion from that visual. âItâs in the red. I better tell someone.â Quicker identification of potential issues leads to fewer breakdowns and shorter outages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe person calls you and says âthis and this is out of standard.â In the 90 seconds it takes to get there, you should already be troubleshooting in your head,â says Absher. âThat saves time.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quality circles:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A small group of team members meet on a regular basis to identify and solve problems. These people raise the level of quality, efficiency and other aspects of work performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe experts â production, maintenance and facilities personnel â determine how to make improvements to processes and remove waste from the system,â says Bremer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;The Numbers Add Up &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The items mentioned are just nine of the tools that Toyota maintenance departments have at their disposal to reduce maintenance and increase overall plant reliability. There is just as much maintenance applicability in other TPS tools, including 5-S, hoshin, jidoka, jishuken, kanban, nemawashi, poka-yoke and yokaten. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The bottom line is that TMMK is not trying to reduce maintenance 50 percent through a two-week kaizen event or any other single tool. Thatâs not the Toyota way. By taking a plethora of tools traditionally thought of as benefiting production and translating and applying them into the maintenance world, the chances of realizing goals â even âimpossible dreamâ goals â increase. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=162 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_toyota-production.jpg" width=250&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;By utilizing Toyota Production System tools &lt;BR&gt;like heijunka, five-whys, visual controls and &lt;BR&gt;genchi genbutsu, the TMMK maintenance &lt;BR&gt;organization is becoming a fine-tuned machine.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Kaizen events might reduce maintenance 12 percent. TPM might supply 8 percent. Intelligent maintenance systems might return 5 percent. 5-S . . . perhaps 4 percent. And so on and so on. Pretty soon, MR-50 doesnât seem that impossible. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You donât have to be Superman, or even Toyota for that matter, to make groundbreaking, meaningful change. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A Toyota saying goes that âthere can be no successful monozukuri (making things) without hito-zukuri (making people).â Developing all those involved with maintenance and reliability into kaizen-minded problem-solvers, and then giving those people the time, tools and support needed to pursue best practices, can radically change the numbers for your department, your plant and your company. Enhanced reputation, production, market share, etc., are within your reach. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you donât think you can apply this, start asking âWhy?â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/kaizen/~4/RFdJXE4Zug4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
