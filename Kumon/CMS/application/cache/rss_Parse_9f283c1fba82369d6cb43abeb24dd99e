			<title>Commercial PACE Projects Get $200M in Funding</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/zp5qbqBvzjM/commercial-pace-projects-get-200m-in-funding</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/commercial-pace-projects-get-200m-in-funding</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://pace-equity.com/press-release-pace-equity-offers-200-million-and-expanded-resources-in-7-states/"&gt;PACE Equity&lt;/a&gt; announced $200 million in new financing for commercial PACE projects, which provides property-assessed clean energy financing for commercial projects. It is also looking to expand its team into Texas, Michigan and more cities in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PACE programs allow investments in water- and energy-efficiency retrofits and distributed renewable generation to be paid back through property taxes, which lowers the risk for both lenders and owners and can potentially open up a far larger swath of the energy-efficiency market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Commercial PACE had been performing better than residential financing until last year, when PACE financing for homes in California &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/plug-and-play-residential-pace-financing-grows-in-california"&gt;eclipsed the rest of the PACE market&lt;/a&gt;. The residential PACE market is estimated at &lt;a href="http://www.pacenation.us/pace-data/" target="_blank"&gt;more than $1 billion by PACENow&lt;/a&gt;, with most of that in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The commercial PACE market is now estimated at about $150 million, so the announcement from PACE Equity would more than double the availability of PACE financing for the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The residential growth is likely to continue by leaps and bounds, as President Obama &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/White-House-Announcement-Means-Today-is-a-Very-Big-Day-For-PACE"&gt;removed a key barrier&lt;/a&gt; to the expansion of PACE for single-family homes at the end of summer by offering clear guidance from the Federal Housing Administration around payment and transfer of PACE liens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after the White House announcement, Renew Financial completed its first securitization of residential PACE bonds by issuing $50 million in privately placed notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://renovateamerica.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Renovate America&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; HERO program, the leader in residential PACE financing, just launched a direct-pay service that removes credit-limit barriers for registered contractors. The new offering is meant to help contractors install solar systems more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;HERO Direct Pay is a great solution for small- and medium-sized solar contractors who have high customer demand because of HERO PACE financing, but can&amp;rsquo;t fulfill that demand because of credit constraints,&amp;rdquo; Greg Memo, executive vice president of business development and product strategy for Renovate America, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Renovate America is not alone in offering new products to help unlock PACE markets. &lt;a href="http://k2cleancap.com/" target="_blank"&gt;K2 Clean Energy Capital&lt;/a&gt; announced last week that it is integrating with the Energy Toolbase software platform, which is used by distributed energy providers to analyze potential projects. The integration will allow developers and installers of commercial products to instantly see PACE financing quotes from K2 for solar and energy-storage projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s well documented that PACE financing for solar is really taking off, and K2 has clearly established themselves as a leader in this space for non-resi projects,&amp;rdquo; John Gurski, founder and CEO of Energy Toolbase, said in a statement.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;This is a great fit for our first financing partner integration."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Florida, another financing company is bringing more options to the commercial solar market to leverage PACE financing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.demeterpower.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Demeter Power Group&lt;/a&gt; has been bringing &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bringing-smaller-scale-commercial-solar-to-market"&gt;solar to small- and medium-sized business&lt;/a&gt; (SMBs) for the past few years. It received $500,000 through the Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/index.html"&gt;SunShot initiative&lt;/a&gt; to help commercial buildings find access to credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using the money from the DOE, Demeter announced it closed its first PACE lease, which brings together solar leasing and PACE financing. The financing was done through the Florida Green Energy Works PACE Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The novel financing structure for the SMB sector in Florida comes at a time when solar advocates and utilities are fighting over the &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-civil-war-is-brewing-over-solar-in-florida"&gt;ban on third-party sales of solar&lt;/a&gt; in the state. Demeter hopes its financing structure will not only grow beyond Florida, but also help change the outlook for solar in the Sunshine State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Customers want the ability to make smart energy choices,&amp;rdquo; Michael Wallander, president of Demeter Power Group, said in a statement. &amp;ldquo;And if our financing helps pave the way for solar and customer choice in Florida, we&amp;rsquo;d be very proud of the precedent set by this transaction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/zp5qbqBvzjM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Solar Frontierâs CEO Aims for 40-Cents-Per-Watt CIGS Modules</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/rPOkAJ4fPvw/Solar-Frontiers-CEO-Aims-For-40-Cents-Per-Watt-CIGS-Modules</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Frontiers-CEO-Aims-For-40-Cents-Per-Watt-CIGS-Modules</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	Japan&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://htpp://www.solar-frontier.com"&gt;Solar Frontier&lt;/a&gt; is the only true volume producer of copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar panels. The company has shipped more than 3 gigawatts&amp;#39; worth of modules since its founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/TSMC-Shutting-Down-CIGS-Thin-Film-Solar-Manufacturing"&gt;No other CIGS company&lt;/a&gt; comes close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GTM interviewed the company&amp;#39;s CEO, Atsuhiko Hirano, at this year&amp;#39;s Solar Power International conference in Anaheim, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unlike vertically integrated First Solar, Solar Frontier sticks to manufacturing solar modules only and works with partners to "form a good, controlled value chain," according to the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-frontier-grabs-thin-film-efficiency-conversion-record-from-first-sola"&gt;Solar Frontier&lt;/a&gt; acquired the 280-megawatt U.S. project pipeline of Gestamp Solar, a developer and operator of utility-scale solar plants -- along with Gestamp&amp;#39;s U.S. development team. Gestamp Solar was backed by the $13 billion industrial holding group, &lt;a href="http://www.corporaciongestamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Corporacion Gestamp&lt;/a&gt;. Charles Pimentel, the COO and SVP of Solar Frontier Americas, emphasized that Solar Frontier remains "strictly a module manufacturer" that is making a foray into project development. "The objective is not to own the projects long-term."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The move to non-Japanese markets is a big shift for the thin-film solar vendor. Over 90 percent of Solar Frontier&amp;#39;s 2014 production (close to 1 gigawatt) went to domestic Japanese installations, according to GTM Research solar analyst Jade Jones. But that imbalance is about to change as the Gestamp projects begin to draw the modules to the U.S. Hirano anticipates a 50-50 shipment mix between Japan and the rest of the world in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Acquiring a turnkey project pipeline gave Solar Frontier an efficient way of entering the U.S. market and joining the race to originate and develop projects before the expiry of the 30 percent federal ITC. More importantly, it establishes Solar Frontier as an active, bankable player in this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CEO Hirano added that the company is looking "to approach the market in a modest way with a small set of partners and a handful of strategic developers where we can bring our resources to bear." Pimentel noted that it took a "sophisticated EPC" to understand and price-in the temperature and shading benefits of thin film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solar Frontier has a number of projects with 2016 CODs throughout California, ranging from the 15-megawatt Lost Hills project to an 80-megawatt project development effort. Pimentel pointed out that the projects are "almost exclusively on single-axis trackers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CEO told GTM that module efficiency for its 170-watt module is 13.8 percent, with champion modules at 14.6 percent. The CEO suggested that the new factory&amp;#39;s efficiency starting point would be 14.6 percent. Thin film leader First Solar builds cadmium-telluride-based solar modules and had a full fleet average efficiency of 15.4 percent and best line efficiencies of 16.3 percent in Q2 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Solar Frontier isn&amp;#39;t competing with First Solar -- it&amp;#39;s competing with polysilicon-based modules, and it still has a few more percentage points to go in efficiency to be able to rival that material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Markus Beck of Siva Power has suggested that the sputtered "Solar Frontier, Stion/&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/TSMC-Shutting-Down-CIGS-Thin-Film-Solar-Manufacturing" target="_blank"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt;, Avancis, Bosch, Hulk, Samsung approaches are all rooted in the late 1980s/early 1990s Arco/Shell/Siemens approach" and have not seen a lot of innovation on the equipment side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solar Frontier&amp;#39;s annual capacity is about 900 megawatts at its Kunitomi plant, with another 150 megawatts ramping up this year at the Tohoku plant. The CEO said, "Once we are up and running, the Tohoku plant will be the mother plant." He said the Tohoku plant is a technological leap with a much shorter process time at two-thirds the capex and opex per megawatt. The CEO added that module cost would approach 40 cents per watt including depreciation, and 30 cents per watt without it. He did not provide a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CEO also confirmed reports that talks are still ongoing for Solar Frontier to build a U.S. factory at the RiverBend site in Buffalo, New York, the same location as SolarCity&amp;#39;s highly incentivized crystalline silicon factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/rPOkAJ4fPvw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	It isn&amp;rsquo;t officially autumn until September 23, but summer pretty much feels like it&amp;rsquo;s over. When it comes to energy news, it feels like summer was hardly here at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The White House certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t slow down, announcing the final version of the &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Video-Breakdown-What-Obamas-Climate-Rule-Really-Means-for-the-Cleantech-I"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt; rule on August 3. President Obama then traveled to Nevada, where he unveiled a plan to &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/White-House-Announcement-Means-Today-is-a-Very-Big-Day-For-PACE"&gt;accelerate the use of PACE loans&lt;/a&gt; and announced &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-actions-bring-renewable-energy" target="_blank"&gt;$1 billion in new loan authority&lt;/a&gt; available for clean-energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Congress took a summer recess, but returned to the Capitol Building after Labor Day with a full slate of &lt;a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/energy-bill-tracker/?_cldee=cHlwZXJAZ3JlZW50ZWNobWVkaWEuY29t&amp;amp;utm_source=ClickDimensions&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Press%20Update%20|%20Energy" target="_blank"&gt;energy legislation&lt;/a&gt; to consider. Among the items is a tax extenders bill with language to extend the &lt;a href="http://www.nawindpower.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.14597" target="_blank"&gt;wind Production Tax Credit&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#39;s now pending a full Senate vote. Also, both the House and Senate are considering &lt;a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/house_senate_seek_careful_bipartisan_balance_as_energy_bills_advance-243033-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;bipartisan pieces of energy legislation&lt;/a&gt; that address everything from the electrical grid to pipelines, energy efficiency to hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the state level, solar continues to be a hot policy topic. Florida in particular is seeing increased activity around two competing solar ballot initiatives, where the divide between utilities and distributed solar advocates has proven to be more prominent than political differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More on Florida and energy news from the &lt;a href="#Southeast"&gt;Southeast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#West"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#Midwest"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#Northeast"&gt;Northeast&lt;/a&gt; below. (You can find our last state dispatches post &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/pepco-maryland-found-to-have-the-slowest-solar-interconnection-times-in-the"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Southeast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Florida&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A brewing debate over whether or not to allow for third-party solar financing in Florida has intensified in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On September 1, the Florida Supreme Court heard arguments for and against the language of &lt;a href="http://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=64491&amp;amp;seqnum=1" target="_blank"&gt;a 2016 ballot initiative&lt;/a&gt; to open up the state&amp;rsquo;s solar market. &lt;a href="http://www.flsolarchoice.org" target="_blank"&gt;Floridians for Solar Choice&lt;/a&gt;, a free-market group spearheading the initiative, argues that the constitutional amendment is necessary to allow more consumer choice when it comes to buying and selling energy in the Sunshine State. Florida is currently one of only&amp;nbsp;four states&amp;nbsp;where laws expressly prohibit citizens and businesses from buying solar power directly from an entity other than an electric utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A wide range of stakeholders &lt;a href="http://www.flsolarchoice.org/about/endorsements/" target="_blank"&gt;from more than 50 organizations&lt;/a&gt; has come out in support the ballot initiative. The coalition has collected more than 225,000 petition signatures to date; nearly 140,000 have been verified&amp;nbsp;by Florida&amp;rsquo;s Division of Elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Opponents have put forward &lt;a href="http://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/fulltext/pdf/64817-1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a rival ballot&lt;/a&gt; being championed by &lt;a href="https://smartsolarfl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Consumers for Smart Solar&lt;/a&gt;, a group supported by Florida&amp;rsquo;s electric utilities, as well as the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, and the 60 Plus Association. Several of these groups have ties to the Koch brothers, according to &lt;a href="http://www.energyandpolicy.org/special-interests-behind-anti-solar-ballot-initiative-consumers-for-smart-solar" target="_blank"&gt;a funding investigation&lt;/a&gt; by the Energy and Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re interested in how utilities are funding efforts to stop the adoption of rooftop solar,&amp;rdquo; said Gabe Elsner, executive director of E&amp;amp;PI. &amp;ldquo;This Florida case is a perfect example where there is an effort to increase the ability for homeowners and businesses to install solar, and sure enough, the utilities are against it, going far enough to create an alternative ballot that does essentially nothing but confuse the issue for voters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Sept. 10, Consumers for Smart Solar announced it had collected 100,000 signatures, enough to trigger a review by Florida&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General and the Florida Supreme Court. The group says its proposed amendment would allow consumers to own and lease solar, while also ensuring that everyone who uses the grid pays for it and that out-of-state solar utilities are not constitutionally immune from state and local consumer protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both camps have &lt;a href="http://www.flsolarchoice.org/press-coverage-new-poll-solar-choice-is-cool-but-it-takes-some-explaining/" target="_blank"&gt;released polls&lt;/a&gt; showing support for their respective amendments. The initiatives will each need a total of 683,149 signatures by February 1, 2016 in order for their amendments to be considered in the November election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other news, Florida Power &amp;amp; Light has filed a request with the Florida Public Service Commission to reduce electricity rates in 2016. The proposal will save a typical 1,000-kilowatt-hour residential customer about $2.50 a month on average next year, compared to 2015 rates. Separately, the Canadian power producer&amp;nbsp;Emera Inc. announced it&amp;rsquo;s making a big bet on the U.S. power market with plans to &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-04/emera-to-buy-florida-utility-teco-energy-for-10-4-billion" target="_blank"&gt;buy Florida generator Teco Energy Inc.&lt;/a&gt; for $6.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Later this week, lawmakers in North Carolina will vote on a state budget that &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/09/republican-budget-compromise-to-sound-death-knell.html" target="_blank"&gt;does not extend&lt;/a&gt; the state&amp;rsquo;s 35 percent tax credit for solar and other clean technologies, to the disappointment many supporters of the measure. The credit is now set to end on December 31. A bill that would have frozen the North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s renewable portfolio standard at 6 percent, instead of progressing to 12.5 percent by 2021, hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen any action in four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, solar deployments continue to grow in the state. Duke Energy recently announced it is on track to &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/duke-energy-renewables-more-than-doubles-its-north-carolina-solar-portfolio-300139840.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than double&lt;/a&gt; its North Carolina solar portfolio this year, with 160 megawatts of new solar projects in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;South Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sunrun &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/national-solar-company-sunrun-brings-solar-leasing-to-south-carolina-for-first-time-2015-09-09" target="_blank"&gt;launched a lease product&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina on Sept. 9, adding to the company&amp;rsquo;s purchase and loan options introduced in June. South Carolina&amp;#39;s Office of the Regulatory Staff began accepting applications from solar leasing companies in August, stemming from the Distributed Energy Resource Program Act (&lt;a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess120_2013-2014/bills/1189.htm" target="_blank"&gt;A236&lt;/a&gt;) signed into law last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In carrying out Act 236, the state PSC approved solar incentive programs from South Carolina&amp;rsquo;s investor-owned utilities, &lt;a href="http://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/press-releases/settlement-agreement-announced-between-duke-energy-conservation-groups-on-s" target="_blank"&gt;Duke Energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/press-releases/settlement-agreement-announced-between-sceg-conservation-groups-on-solar-in" target="_blank"&gt;South Carolina Gas &amp;amp; Electric&lt;/a&gt;, this spring. The law also requires regulatory staff to &lt;a href="http://www.regulatorystaff.sc.gov/Documents/Electric%20and%20Gas/Stakeholder%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issue a report&lt;/a&gt; on cost-shifting associated with distributed energy by the end of the year. Public comments are currently being accepted through Sept. 15.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Alabama &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Sept. 1, the Alabama Public Service Commission &lt;a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/psc-approves-alabama-powers-request-for-500-mw-of-alternative-energy" target="_blank"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Alabama Power&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://alabamanewscenter.com/2015/07/14/alabama-power-seeking-up-to-500-megawatts-of-renewable-generation-including-solar/" target="_blank"&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to build 500 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. The utility said the decision will help Alabama Power meet the demands of &lt;a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/psc_approves_alabama_powers_re.html" target="_blank"&gt;large customers&lt;/a&gt;, primarily Fortune 500 companies and military facilities with renewable energy mandates. These customers would pay a premium for the power, so that costs are not transferred to the broader rate base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The commission made several changes to the original proposal, including a biennial competitive bidding process for projects, the approval of no more than 160 megawatts of projects per year, and a PSC vote on whether or not to approve each project. Alabama Power had no objections to the changes. Clean-energy advocates were also supportive of the outcome, including the &lt;a href="http://www.seia.org/news/seia-urges-approval-alabama-power-s-proposal" target="_blank"&gt;Solar Energy Industries Association&lt;/a&gt;, which noted that there are just 2 megawatts of solar installed in Alabama today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our neighboring states may have a head start in realizing the environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy, but Alabama can use this opportunity to catch up and spur growth in this booming marketplace,&amp;rdquo; said Keith Johnston of the Southern Environmental Law Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Virginia &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Sept. 2, Governor Terry McAuliffe launched a &lt;a href="http://www.vasavesgcp.com" target="_blank"&gt;$20 million loan program&lt;/a&gt; to lower financing costs for energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, and alternative fuel projects. According to a recent &lt;a href="http://www.richmond.com/business/local/article_a6245592-df1d-57d2-8a30-36b066b89c60.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia currently ranks 30th in solar power deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Washington, D.C. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a major turn of events, the D.C. Public Service Commission &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/d.c.-regulators-block-exelons-takeover-of-pepco"&gt;denied Exelon&amp;rsquo;s $6.8 billion takeover&lt;/a&gt; of Pepco Holdings on Aug. 25.&amp;nbsp; A strong &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-opponents-helped-thwart-exelons-bid-to-acquire-pepco"&gt;grassroots movement&lt;/a&gt; helped to thwart the deal, but Exelon and Pepco have vowed the battle isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet. The utilities have 30 days from the ruling to &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-exelon-pepco-merger-0901-biz-20150831-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;appeal the decision&lt;/a&gt;. Five states have already approved the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;West &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lawmakers in California passed a bill last Friday targeting a &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-bill-50-percent-renewables"&gt;50 percent renewables&lt;/a&gt; energy mix by 2030, and a 50 percent increase in building energy efficiency by the same year. Controversial language that would have required a 50 percent reduction in oil use in the state was ultimately struck from the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The legislature also passed a bill to divest from coal (&lt;a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB185" target="_blank"&gt;SB 185&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a resolution in support of extending the federal tax credit for solar energy systems; &lt;a href="mailto:http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sjr_10_bill_20150910_amended_asm_v96.pdf"&gt;SJR 10&lt;/a&gt; calls on Congress to extend the 30 percent tax credit for residential and commercial solar projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In utility news, the CPUC announced on Aug. 28 that it has launched a &lt;a href="http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M154/K291/154291675.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;formal investigation&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether PG&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;organizational culture and governance prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards.&amp;rdquo; The investigation stems from a fatal 2010 pipeline explosion. The CPUC also issued a citation to PG&amp;amp;E for $50,000 for the utility&amp;rsquo;s failure to safely maintain its Metcalf Substation in San Jose, which was burglarized the night of Aug 26. Meanwhile, regulators have required SCE to &lt;a href="../../../Applications/Microsoft%20Office%202011/Microsoft%20Word.app/Contents/lbpost.com/news/2000006972-california-public-utilities-commission-calls-on-sce-to-issue-inspections-and-tether-manhole-covers-in-letter"&gt;investigate&lt;/a&gt; the cause of several recent outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Nevada &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NV Energy has filed a proposal with the state PUC to launch a community solar subscription program, the &lt;em&gt;Reno Gazette-Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2015/09/11/nv-energy-proposes-new-community-solar-subscription-program/72088562/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The energy will come from two 5-megawatt solar farms and will be available to consumers in 100-kilowatt blocks. Customers will have to pay a premium for the power, but in return will get to go solar without signing a long-term contract or paying for anything upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proposal comes shortly after the PUC voted to extend the state&amp;#39;s existing solar net-metering policy through the end of year, as the commission debates the future of the program. A week earlier, NV Energy announced the state had hit its 235-megawatt net metering cap, which sparked a &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Dear-Nevada-Ratepayer-Advocate-Continue-The-Existing-Net-Metering-Rules"&gt;backlash&lt;/a&gt; from solar advocates. Vivint Solar &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Vivint-Pulls-Out-of-Nevada-After-Only-Two-Weeks-in-the-State"&gt;suspended operations&lt;/a&gt; in the state a few weeks prior to the decision amid the policy uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NV Energy filed an &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Net-Metering-Conflict-Flares-up-Again-in-Nevada"&gt;alternative solar policy&lt;/a&gt; with the PUC in August that would have reduced the value of net metering credits and added new fees on solar customers. The interim rate is not what the utility proposed, but that could change in 2016. The Nevada PUC is required to decide on a permanent net-metering structure by December 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the value of solar debate played out in the Nevada PUC last month, it also played out on stage in &lt;a href="http://www.utilitydive.com/news/as-regulators-act-nevada-net-metering-debate-takes-center-stage-at-las-veg/404799/" target="_blank"&gt;a debate&lt;/a&gt; at Sen. Harry Reid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.cleanenergysummit.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National&amp;nbsp;Clean Energy Summit&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to rolling out new energy incentives, President Obama criticized lobbying efforts from the Koch brothers and others in his &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/25/remarks-president-national-clean-energy-summit" target="_blank"&gt;keynote address&lt;/a&gt; at the event, accusing them of &amp;ldquo;standing in the way of the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Arizona &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In late August, the Arizona Corporation Commission &lt;a href="http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/arizona-regulators-push-back-utilitys-request-to-modify-net-metering-to-2016_100020704/#axzz3lOpF7ya2" target="_blank"&gt;approved a motion&lt;/a&gt; from Tucson Electric to hold off on any changes to solar net metering until the utility&amp;rsquo;s 2016 rate case. The move came in sharp contrast to a decision made two days earlier, in which the ACC said it would start hearings this year on a proposal to raise fees on solar customers from Arizona Public Service. APS is seeking to increase its solar fee from roughly $5 per month to $21 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Commissioner Doug Little, who was elected last year, said that holding hearings on the APS fee increase request does not guarantee it will be approved, &lt;em&gt;The Arizona Republic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="tucson.com/business/local/regulators-to-set-hearings-on-aps-rooftop-solar-fee/article_16a638c6-2b30-5e4f-8b0f-35996a92c4b7.html" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Little also filed an amendment to study whether or not there is a cost shift from solar to non-solar customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, the attorney general&amp;rsquo;s office is investigating allegations of overly friendly ties between ACC commissioners Bob Stump and Gary Pierce and APS. On Sept. 2, &lt;a href="http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/complaint-asks-for-removal-of-arizona-corporation-commission-chairwoman" target="_blank"&gt;a separate complaint&lt;/a&gt; was filed against ACC Chairwoman Susan Bitter Smith for her previous work as a lobbyist. Amid the controversy, the solar advocacy group The Alliance for Solar Choice has &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2015/09/02/rooftop-solar-group-offers-stay-out-elections/71592236/" target="_blank"&gt;committed to staying out&lt;/a&gt; of the ACC&amp;rsquo;s 2016 elections, and has invited utilities to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Mexico &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Sept. 14, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez unveiled an &lt;a href="http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/EnergyPolicy/documents/EMNRD_EnergyPolicy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;ldquo;all-of-the-above&amp;rdquo; energy policy&lt;/a&gt; designed to support the development of oil, natural gas and coal, as well as low-carbon energy resources. The plan includes reducing soft costs for renewable projects through improved permitting, pursuing energy storage development, and possibly raising New Mexico&amp;rsquo;s renewable portfolio standard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Separately, the Santa Fe-based group New Energy Economy filed a motion with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission in early September, seeking to prevent four of the five commissioners from making decisions related to one of the state&amp;rsquo;s coal-fired power plants. The group has &lt;a href="http://www.elp.com/articles/2015/09/n-m-regulators-accused-of-chummy-relations-with-pnm.html" target="_blank"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the commissioners of having close ties with utility executives based on 100 pages of text messages and emails. The first hearing on the Public Service Co. of New Mexico-owned coal plant is scheduled for Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Alaska &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After his appearance in Nevada, President Obama made his way north to Alaska where he called for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/us-makes-urgent-appeal-for-climate-change-action-at-alaska-conference.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;urgent action&lt;/a&gt; to address climate change. The Obama administration said it plans to launch a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/02/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-investments-combat-climate" target="_blank"&gt;$4 million renewable energy initiative&lt;/a&gt; for remote Alaskan communities. Shortly before the president&amp;rsquo;s trip, the federal government gave Royal Dutch Shell &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/08/17/shell-arctic-alaska/31890239/" target="_blank"&gt;final approval&lt;/a&gt; to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska&amp;#39;s northwest coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Washington &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Washington state recently passed a &lt;a href="http://www.cleantechalliance.org/news/248594/Clean-Energy-Fund-II-Update.htm" target="_blank"&gt;$40 million extension&lt;/a&gt; to the state&amp;rsquo;s Clean Energy Fund. As part of the implementation process, the Department of Commerce will soon convene &lt;a href="http://www.cleantechalliance.org/news/248594/Clean-Energy-Fund-II-Update.htm" target="_blank"&gt;two advisory panels&lt;/a&gt;, one for electric utilities and one for clean-energy research and development. The panels are expected to hold public meetings through September to determine how to distribute the funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Colorado &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Aug. 26, the Colorado PUC voted to uphold net metering in its current form, despite calls for change from the state&amp;#39;s largest electric utility, Xcel Energy. Separately, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman announced her state will join a &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_28725098/colorado-attorney-general-join-suit-obamas-clean-power" target="_blank"&gt;multi-state suit&lt;/a&gt; against the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Hawaii &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NextEra Energy recently offered to make &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nextera-promises-grid-upgrades-and-greater-savings-with-hei-acquisition"&gt;50 new commitments&lt;/a&gt; to Hawaiian electricity customers as part of the Florida-based company&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms/DocketSearch" target="_blank"&gt;$4.3 billion proposal&lt;/a&gt; to buy out Hawaiian Electric Industries. Promises include a commitment to Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/hawaii-passes-legislation-to-go-100-renewable"&gt;100 percent renewable&lt;/a&gt; energy target, new spending on smart grid technology, and nearly $1 billion in customer savings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In July, Hawaii Gov. David Ige told the &lt;em&gt;Honolulu Star-Advertiser &lt;/em&gt;that he &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/NextEras-4.3B-Acquisition-of-HEI-Opposed-by-Hawaii-State-Agencies-Govern"&gt;opposes the acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, and is recommending that the PUC reject it. More than 40 state and county leaders have come together to explore whether a &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/09/03/hawaii-lawmakers-explore-public-utility-ownership.html" target="_blank"&gt;public utility ownership option&lt;/a&gt; is a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While opposition is strong, the two utilities are taking steps to &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2015/09/09/sale-of-hawaiian-electric-to-nextera-energy-clears.html" target="_blank"&gt;move the merger forward&lt;/a&gt;. The commission will hold &lt;a href="http://cca.hawaii.gov/dca/nextera-energy-inc-hawaiian-electric-merger/" target="_blank"&gt;several public meetings&lt;/a&gt; on all islands over the next two months. A final decision is expected by June 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Midwest &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Ohio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On August 31, the Ohio PUC held its first hearing on FirstEnergy&amp;rsquo;s rate case that would require customers at the holding company&amp;rsquo;s three distribution utilities -- Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating, and Toledo Edison -- to purchase power from two of its struggling power plants for the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	FirstEnergy claims the two plants -- a large, old &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/W._H._Sammis_Power_Plant" target="_blank"&gt;coal plant&lt;/a&gt; in Stratton, Ohio and a large, old &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Davis%E2%80%93Besse_Nuclear_Power_Station" target="_blank"&gt;nuclear plant&lt;/a&gt; on Lake Erie -- need to stay open to maintain grid reliability and energy affordability. The company has admitted that electricity costs may rise in the near term, but estimates the deal will save ratepayers $2 billion over the 15-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, according to the Ohio Consumers&amp;#39; Counsel, the deal would &lt;a href="http://www.occ.ohio.gov/electric/fe/Factsheet_FirstEnergy_ESP_2016-2019.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cost ratepayers $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the lifetime of the agreement. FirstEnergy&amp;rsquo;s consultant also admitted at the hearing that future &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ae5d3a0c6088cad29d71bf0d0&amp;amp;id=6a03ec9eb7&amp;amp;e=2a553518aa" target="_blank"&gt;wholesale energy costs were overestimated&lt;/a&gt; in the utility&amp;rsquo;s forecast, undercutting the credibility of the utility&amp;rsquo;s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to costs, there are concerns about &lt;a href="http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/08/firstenrgy_could_improve_power.html" target="_blank"&gt;PUC oversight&lt;/a&gt;. Environmental groups and competitive energy providers Dynegy and AEP are also &lt;a href="http://rtxcom.cmail1.com/t/i-l-jucgt-yhukqitd-yh/" target="_blank"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt; to the FirstEnergy deal. Earlier in the year, PUCO &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.com/2015/04/07/duke-decision-on-ohio-bailout-proposal-mirrors-aep-ruling/" target="_blank"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; similar &amp;ldquo;bailout&amp;rdquo; proposals from Duke and AEP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As hearings on the FirstEnergy proposal continue through fall, Ohioans will also debate the future of the state&amp;#39;s stalled renewable portfolio standard. &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/OH/text/SB310/2013" target="_blank"&gt;Legislation&lt;/a&gt; passed last year put a two-year freeze on the RPS. Ohio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.com/2015/04/14/advocates-hope-ohio-energy-committee-will-broaden-focus/" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Mandates Study Committee&lt;/a&gt; now has until September 30 to decide how the state should proceed.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A broad coalition of state business, health, community and environmental groups has come out in &lt;a href="http://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/news/state/2015/09/10/broad-ohio-coalition-wants-renewable-energy-targets-restored/71992036/" target="_blank"&gt;support of lifting the freeze&lt;/a&gt;. Advocates say lifting the RPS will help Ohio comply with the Clean Power Plan. Many lawmakers are against the RPS, however. Meanwhile, Ohio is already in &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-epa-lawsuit-20140805-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;litigation&lt;/a&gt; challenging the new federal rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Michigan &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michigan officials recently announced they plan to develop their &lt;a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/energy/Michigan_to_Develop_Its_Own_State_Carbon_Implementation_Plan_to_Ensure_It_Retains_Control_of_Its_Energy_Future_498764_7.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;own compliance strategy&lt;/a&gt; for the EPA&amp;rsquo;s Clean Power Plan, as opposed to letting the federal government devise a plan for the state. The decision has &lt;a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/energy/SCIP_Statements_and_Attachments_498867_7.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;received support&lt;/a&gt; from a broad group of energy stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final EPA rule gives states until 2018 to file their carbon reduction plans, and until 2022 to begin making emissions cuts. Michigan will need all of the time allotted in order to comply, said Valerie Brader, executive director of the Michigan Agency for Energy, on a recent call with reporters. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not filing anything early,&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="http://www.elp.com/articles/2015/09/michigan-to-comply-with-epa-rules-for-power-plants.html" target="_blank"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Republican Gov. Rick Snyder&amp;rsquo;s administration is preparing to comply with the rule in part by raising Michigan&amp;rsquo;s 10 percent renewable energy target through voluntary measures. Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Schuette has joined a lawsuit trying to block the federal plan. Brader said that Schuette is acting alone, and that the governor&amp;rsquo;s office does not plan to join the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work also continues in the Michigan state legislature, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers recently introduced a package of bills, dubbed the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://housedems.com/article/bipartisan-energy-freedom-bills-empower-michiganders-produce-clean-energy" target="_blank"&gt;Energy Freedom bills&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; to lift the cap on the state&amp;rsquo;s net metering program and allow consumers to buy shares of a community renewable energy project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another set of bills in the package would establish fair value pricing, which &amp;ldquo;ensures that homeowners and businesses get paid what utility companies would pay themselves for producing renewable energy,&amp;rdquo; according to the bill sponsors. Under the bill, the Michigan Public Service Commission would come up with a methodology that &amp;ldquo;accounts for the value of the renewable energy, its delivery, generation capacity, transmission capacity, transmission and distribution line losses, environmental value, and other values that are not always considered in current energy prices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Freedom legislation comes in response to a separate bill (&lt;a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28ri1uskmmqn4d20lqzjy0lm2v%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;amp;objectname=2015-SB-0438" target="_blank"&gt;SB 0438&lt;/a&gt;) that would eliminate net metering in Michigan. The proposal has received support from utilities and &lt;a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/opinion/20150904/michigan-state-senators-senate-working-on-next-generation-of-energy-policy" target="_blank"&gt;several Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, but is opposed by solar customers and &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/michigan-tea-party-lawmaker-we-should-be-incentivizing-solar"&gt;Tea Party member Rep. Gary Glenn&lt;/a&gt;, who is a sponsor of the Energy Freedom bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Wisconsin PSC will hold public hearings Sept. 16 and Oct. 29 on Xcel Energy&amp;rsquo;s request to &lt;a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/public-hearings-on-xcel-rate-changes-in-menomonie-madison/article_ce5eeaf9-4fa3-5dd1-a03b-0821cca59211.html" target="_blank"&gt;increase electric revenues&lt;/a&gt; by 3.9 percent and natural gas by 5 percent. The utility has proposed to lower the cost of electricity, while more than doubling the flat monthly service fee on about 255,000 non-industrial customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, the renewables industry is far less than thrilled with Governor Scott Walker&amp;rsquo;s record on wind and solar, which has put the state well behind its neighbors on clean energy deployments, Bloomberg &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-02/scott-walker-s-record-on-wind-and-solar-power-leaves-renewables-industry-fuming" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Walker, a Republican presidential hopeful, also opposes the Clean Power Plan. Sen. Ron Johnson opposes the CPP, too. The League of Conservation Voters and EDF Action launched a $1.6 million ad campaign in Wisconsin on Sept. 1 to urge Sen. Johnson to end his opposition to the CPP, with the U.S. Senate expected to consider votes on the EPA&amp;rsquo;s plan this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Illinois &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Exelon&amp;rsquo;s nuclear fleet in Illinois has cleared PJM&amp;rsquo;s most recent &lt;a href="http://qctimes.com/business/exelon-nuclear-plants-clear-latest-auction/article_f1ce81fc-2883-5543-b89b-590ad6e2e009.html" target="_blank"&gt;capacity auction&lt;/a&gt;, throwing a lifeline to the utility&amp;rsquo;s troubled Quad Cities and Byron plants, the &lt;em&gt;Quad-City Business Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://progressillinois.com/news/content/2015/09/10/exelon-delays-decisions-quad-cities-byron-plants-year" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The decision allows the nuclear plants to sell power into the wholesale power market until 2017. Exelon has said it will need to keep all of its Illinois nuclear plants in operation in order to comply with the EPA&amp;rsquo;s new carbon regulations, and is pushing for a "&lt;a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/news/content/2015/02/26/exelon-proposes-low-carbon-standard-boost-struggling-power-plants" target="_blank"&gt;low-carbon portfolio standard&lt;/a&gt;" in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Iowa &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In late August, Pella Cooperative Electric &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ae5d3a0c6088cad29d71bf0d0&amp;amp;id=adc86b173b&amp;amp;e=2a553518aa" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew plans&lt;/a&gt; to impose an additional $57.50 monthly fee on solar customers, which would have resulted in one of the highest fixed rates in the country. Pella sent a letter to its 3,000 members in June notifying them that the fixed rate increase would apply to anyone who installed solar after Aug. 15. The co-op eventually backed down &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.com/2015/07/23/iowa-farmer-says-hell-remove-solar-if-co-ops-85-fixed-charge-stands/" target="_blank"&gt;under pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Kansas &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Kansas Corporation Commission gave Westar Energy the green light for a &lt;a href="http://cjonline.com/news/business/2015-08-25/kcc-gives-green-light-78-million-rate-hike-westar" target="_blank"&gt;$78 million rate increase&lt;/a&gt; on nearly 700,000 customers, which is half of what the utility initially sought. Regulators also postponed consideration of a special charge on solar customers, but plan to address it in a future hearing. In the meantime, potential solar customers have been &lt;a href="http://midwestenergynews.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ae5d3a0c6088cad29d71bf0d0&amp;amp;id=299be3186d&amp;amp;e=2a553518aa" target="_blank"&gt;put on notice&lt;/a&gt; that the rules could change. National solar installers have been barred from intervening in the solar policy docket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Northeast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Maine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In response to a factory closure, Governor Paul LePage sent a letter to Maine&amp;rsquo;s legislative leaders in late August &lt;a href="http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Gov+News&amp;amp;id=653740&amp;amp;v=article2011" target="_blank"&gt;calling on them to reform&lt;/a&gt; the state&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;obsolete and costly energy policies.&amp;rdquo; LePage put forward three pieces of legislation last session that he criticized lawmakers for not passing, including a bill (&lt;a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/bills_127th/billtexts/SP052101.asp" target="_blank"&gt;LD 1987&lt;/a&gt;) that would have eliminated both the state&amp;rsquo;s renewable portfolio standard and net metering program. That bill passed in the Senate, but died in the House in June. The state legislature ultimately passed a bill (&lt;a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0863&amp;amp;item=3&amp;amp;snum=127" target="_blank"&gt;LD 1263&lt;/a&gt;) that sets the stage to replace the current net energy metering policy with an &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Bill-Passed-in-Maine-Sets-the-Stage-for-an-Innovative-Alternative-to"&gt;innovative alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Hampshire &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SolarCity has expanded its New Hampshire presence with a new operations center in Manchester. Gov. Maggie Hassan attended the opening on Sept. 9. The center is SolarCity&amp;#39;s first in the state, after launching a New Hampshire service in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion has renewed questions about the future of New Hampshire&amp;rsquo;s renewable energy incentives. Liberty Utilities hit its net metering cap in July, and other utilities are approaching their limits. At the SolarCity opening, Gov. Hassan said her office will &amp;ldquo;take a look at that issue.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the PUC has put all &lt;a href="http://www.nhsea.org/content/legislative-update" target="_blank"&gt;renewable energy rebates on hold&lt;/a&gt; after the state&amp;rsquo;s renewable energy fund brought in less revenue than expected. The programs are expected to reopen, albeit with decreased incentives, once the PUC sets a 2016 budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Policymakers in Massachusetts are grappling with how to develop a sustainable solar policy with the state&amp;rsquo;s net-metering cap fast approaching. National Grid already hit its cap in March, generally making solar projects less economical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Democratic-led state senate &lt;a href="http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/massachusetts_senate_votes_to_1.html" target="_blank"&gt;passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; before the summer recess in July to lift the net metering cap until Massachusetts reaches its target of 1,600 megawatts of installed solar. In August, Gov. Charlie Baker introduced &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Massachusetts-Solar-Bill-Raises-Net-Metering-Caps-Looks-to-Replace-SREC-P"&gt;a separate bill&lt;/a&gt; that would raise the cap for all solar projects in the interim, and eventually reduce compensation for large municipal projects. A robust debate is expected in the legislature, now that lawmakers have returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also in August, Massachusetts utilities Eversource Energy, National Grid and Unitil filed grid modernization plans to reduce energy costs, boost resiliency and improve the integration of distributed resources, EnergyBiz &lt;a href="http://www.energybiz.com/article/15/08/massachusetts-utilities-lay-out-vision-future-grid" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unitil plans to spend $12 million to become more of an &amp;ldquo;enabling platform.&amp;rdquo; Eversource has proposed a $430.7 million, five-year plan with four main components: grid-wide situational awareness, advanced analytics, real-time flexibility and distributed generation integration. National Grid presented four options that range from $225.3 million over five years, up to $1.3 billion over 10 years. All three utilities will offer optional time-of-use rates for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New York &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Stakeholders in New York continued to work on the &lt;a href="http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/CC4F2EFA3A23551585257DEA007DCFE2?OpenDocument" target="_blank"&gt;Reforming the Energy Vision&lt;/a&gt; proceeding through the summer. On August 18, the Market Design and Platform Technology Working Groups filed their &lt;a href="http://www.newyorkrevworkinggroups.com" target="_blank"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; with the New York State Department of Public Service as staff develop guidance for New York utility Distributed System Implementation Plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also under the REV umbrella, NYSERDA announced &lt;a href="https://www.longislandexchange.com/press-releases/nyserda-announces-donovan-gordon-to-lead-effort-to-expand-renewable-cooling-and-heating-markets-in-new-york/" target="_blank"&gt;Donovan Gordon&lt;/a&gt; will lead efforts to expand renewable heating and cooling markets in New York, and Gov. Cuomo has announced the state&amp;rsquo;s first large-scale &lt;a href="http://www.rewmag.com/article/new-york-city-anaerobic-digestion" target="_blank"&gt;anaerobic digester&lt;/a&gt; project on Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Jersey &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Governor Chris Christie has &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/christie_looks_for_stay_from_obamas_clean_energy.html" target="_blank"&gt;filed a letter&lt;/a&gt; with the EPA seeking a stay of implementation and reconsideration of the Clean Power Plan, calling it &amp;ldquo;unlawful&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fundamentally flawed.&amp;rdquo; Christie&amp;rsquo;s office said New Jersey is the first &amp;ldquo;clean energy&amp;rdquo; state to file an objection to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Action against the CPP comes shortly after Christie &lt;a href="http://www.solarreviews.com/news/christie_expands_net-metering_new_jersey_081115/" target="_blank"&gt;upheld a law&lt;/a&gt; to expand New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s net metering caps, and as state leaders work to update New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s 2011 Energy Master Plan. Several stakeholders pushed for a &lt;a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/calls-for-wind-solar-power-at-energy-master-plan-hearing/article_4ea77b2a-452e-11e5-bef1-cfcb49d0df6c.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher renewable energy targets&lt;/a&gt; at a public hearing on Aug. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Separately, the Bureau of Land Management has confirmed it will host an &lt;a href="http://www.nawindpower.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.14588" target="_blank"&gt;offshore wind auction&lt;/a&gt; this fall for sites off the coast of New Jersey. The 344,000 acres available for leasing could support up to 3.4 gigawatts of commercial wind generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/Myuzzou7TPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Texas Mulls the Market Power of Distributed Energy Resources</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/nRjNgfXKBkw/texas-mulls-boundaries-of-distributed-energys-market-power</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/texas-mulls-boundaries-of-distributed-energys-market-power</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	This summer, Texas grid operator ERCOT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/texas-looks-to-distributed-energy-resources-as-market-players"&gt;started working on ideas&lt;/a&gt; for opening the state&amp;rsquo;s energy markets to distributed energy resources, by allowing the grid-scale aggregation of rooftop customer-sited generators. It&amp;rsquo;s a move similar to those being taken in solar-rich states &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/independents-to-calif-utilities-more-grid-edge-data-please" target="_blank"&gt;like California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/featured/The-Land-of-Surf-Sun-and-Startups-5-Promising-Energy-Companies-Working-in"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, only with Texas&amp;rsquo; unique deregulated market flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One interesting question is how to build distributed energy resource (DER) portfolios with enough flexibility to optimize their value to the grid and their owners, but not so much flexibility that companies can game the system. It&amp;#39;s a concern in the state that spawned Enron, and it&amp;rsquo;s part of the discussion around ERCOT&amp;rsquo;s new concept paper, released last week, that lays out a first official outline of what the state&amp;rsquo;s DER future might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The white paper is for ERCOT&amp;rsquo;s Distributed Resource Energy &amp;amp; Ancillaries&amp;nbsp;Market (DREAM) Task Force, or DREAMTF for acronym fans. The document largely hews to the three key classifications ERCOT is considering -- DER Minimal, DER Light, and DER Heavy -- and a description of just what will need to happen, and what future questions need to be answered, to make each version into a real-world grid product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Roughly speaking, DER Minimal would set compensation like demand response today, at the regional market clearing price of one of Texas&amp;#39; four grid zones. DER Light and Heavy, by contrast, would allow payment at prices set at the more than 11,000 nodes across the state, where prices can shift and spike more quickly to reflect local conditions, and are usually reserved to big generators. DER Heavy adds another layer: real-time dispatchability to meet fast-responding ancillary services markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ERCOT_DREAMTF_XL.jpg" style="width: 580px; height: 475px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s a truly novel opportunity for small-scale energy resources in the state, according to Chad Blevins, senior consultant with Austin, Texas-based law firm The Butler Firm and chairman of ERCOT&amp;rsquo;s &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/committees/board/tac/wms/etwg"&gt;Emerging Technologies Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. But it comes with a lot more responsibility to measure and report that data in real time, to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s doing what it&amp;rsquo;s being paid for, he noted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DERs break many boundaries in how today&amp;rsquo;s grid markets are structured. For example, the Texas market maintains strict separation between generators, &amp;ldquo;wires&amp;rdquo; utilities, and the retail energy providers that do business with customers. But DERs cross over all three of these realms, which requires some fudging of the rules made for power plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same time, DERs represent both generation and load. In the case of &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Value-of-Battery-Backed-Solar-in-California-25-Cents-per-Kilowatt-Hour"&gt;energy storage, it can be both&lt;/a&gt;, in fact. Today&amp;rsquo;s energy market participants have to keep strict separation between those two realms. But well-managed DERs could flex their load curves alongside their generation curves, to add flexibility and efficiency to the profile they present the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of this creates potential points of contention between mainline power generators and the would-be pioneers of the distributed energy grid. One of the big emerging ones, Blevins said, is over how to allow combined generation and load resources to play into the markets. And unlike many of the other differences of opinion that have arisen in workshops addressing the topic, &amp;ldquo;This one will be something that will eventually have to come to a vote,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the side of the DER proponents, &amp;ldquo;The idea that a component of a DER could be part of a market participatory distributed energy resource at some times, and at others the component, is providing service on-site, at the premise it&amp;rsquo;s located -- that physical option is seen by some as a perfectly reasonable thing that should be allowed,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Other market participants will strongly argue against that. They will say that is gaming at best, because it is not actually providing a better economic outcome to the market as a whole, and at worst, they&amp;rsquo;ll say that is an avenue for market manipulation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s why, he said. Imagine an unscrupulous distributed energy aggregator with a lot of &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/stem-wants-to-make-distributed-storage-a-market-maker-not-a-price-taker"&gt;behind-the-meter energy storage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and building energy management that can shift load up and down with precision. &amp;ldquo;Without the proper boundaries on its actions, that could use a whole lot of load, and the cost of that load is load-zone price, averaged out&amp;rdquo; -- in other words, not as responsive to the sudden large increase in load at one particular node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But this hypothetical operator does get paid that nodal price for the power it sends back to the grid -- and by &amp;ldquo;driving up the congestion, and thus the locational price of the bus they happen to be behind, they can then turn around very quickly and inject energy at that higher price,&amp;rdquo; he said. (This &lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/contours/rtmLmpHg.html" target="_blank"&gt;real-time map&lt;/a&gt; of locational marginal prices across Texas indicates how they can shift over the course of the day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;That is the Enron scenario that people are painting and pointing to&amp;rdquo; as reasons to limit DERs to either acting wholly as a load resource or supply resource, not both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, many of these DER companies are focusing heavily on demand charge reduction -- the task of shaving peak consumption to reduce the portion of the utility bill set by maximum power usage at certain times of the day or year. This is the main business model for behind-the-meter batteries from companies like Stem and Green Charge Networks in demand-charge-heavy states like California and New York.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Luckily, there are solutions to this problem, said Blevins. &amp;ldquo;As long as we write into the protocols just what a DER is allowed to do, we can still have that option in place, in a way that does not permit gaming,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One clear guideline in ERCOT&amp;rsquo;s white paper is the need for separate metering of storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another idea is to ask DER Light and Heavy participants to follow a &amp;ldquo;current operating plan,&amp;rdquo; or COP, like today&amp;rsquo;s large-scale generators do, he said. COPs lay out their plans for the hours, days and weeks ahead, and require payment of penalties when providers don&amp;rsquo;t comply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The white paper also &amp;ldquo;recommends that DER Light be required to communicate certain data in real time or near-real time to ERCOT," to be able to include their effects on its own pricing scheme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;#39;s good reason for ERCOT to seek out more data on what&amp;#39;s happening in the DER landscape, Blevins noted. "They recognize there are DERs being installed anyway -- and they have no visibility into all that stuff out there right now. They know through interconnection data that it&amp;rsquo;s there, and they can use telemetry to know what it&amp;rsquo;s doing at any particular time, but they don&amp;rsquo;t know what it plans to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/nRjNgfXKBkw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>California Passes a Bill Targeting 50% Renewables by 2030</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/C_jGHXnYM24/california-bill-50-percent-renewables</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-bill-50-percent-renewables</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the final hours of the legislative session, California lawmakers passed a landmark climate bill that will promote greater deployment of clean energy technologies over the next 15 years, but which some supporters say still fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SB 350 will increase building energy efficiency in the state by 50 percent by 2030. It will also boost the amount of renewable energy utilities need to buy to 50 percent by 2030. California&amp;#39;s three investor-owned utilities are already well on their way to meeting the state&amp;#39;s 33 percent renewable energy goal by 2020, according to the California Public Utilities Commission&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/0605598F-AE7E-43D2-BA27-1580C0F09421/0/2014Q4RPSReportFINAL3315.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-quarter 2014 RPS report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third major component of the bill -- a target to reduce oil use in cars and trucks by 50 percent over the next 15 years -- was struck down earlier in the week. The measure was strongly opposed by oil industry groups, including the Western States Petroleum Association, which insisted that the target would cripple California&amp;rsquo;s economy and even lead to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/us/california-democrats-drop-plan-to-force-50-percent-cut-in-oil-use.html" target="_blank"&gt;bans on SUVs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"We are disappointed that the legislature was unable to take action this session setting specific transportation goals for 2030, which would have sent a clear market signal for continued growth of electric vehicles and alternative fuels over the next decade," said Graham Richard, the CEO of Advanced Energy Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Senate leader and bill author Kevin de Le&amp;oacute;n harshly criticized the oil industry&amp;rsquo;s scare tactics earlier this week. &amp;ldquo;Big Oil might be on the right side of their shareholder reports, but we&amp;rsquo;re on the right side of history,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SB 350 embodies the environmental goals Governor Jerry Brown laid out in his &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/calif.-gov.-jerry-brown-calls-for-50-renewables-by-2030" target="_blank"&gt;inaugural address&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Brown praised the passage of the bill on Friday, but insisted the battle to reduce oil use is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, to the dismay of both &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-solar-industry-stands-divided-over-californias-future-renewable-energy"&gt;solar companies and utilities&lt;/a&gt;, SB 350 does not specify that distributed solar arrays count toward the mandatory component of the renewable energy target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SB 350 is one of &lt;a href="https://focus.senate.ca.gov/climate/full-package" target="_blank"&gt;12 climate bills&lt;/a&gt; that have been working their way through the California state legislature. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A separate bill (SB 32) that would have required California to reduce emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 &lt;a href="http://www.capradio.org/56748"&gt;failed to pass&lt;/a&gt; in the Assembly&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; despite strong support from the governor, as well as from U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, lawmakers did pass legislation (&lt;a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB185" target="_blank"&gt;SB 185&lt;/a&gt;) mandating that the state&amp;#39;s two largest pension funds divest from coal companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the state&amp;#39;s legislative session now over, clean energy advocates are focusing their attention on the California Public Utilities Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;rsquo;s three investor-owed utilities have &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-utilities-plan-for-net-metering-20-fixed-charges-lower-payments"&gt;filed proposals&lt;/a&gt; to reduce compensation for net-metered solar customers, and add monthly charges for the electricity these customers consume. While the changes are expected to raise solar customers&amp;rsquo; electricity bills (from an average of $65 per month to $135 per month in Southern California Edison territory), utilities claim solar customers will continue to see savings, especially as solar costs decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a recent &lt;a href="http://newsroom.edison.com/stories/southern-california-edison-proposal-continues-support-of-solar" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Caroline Choi, SCE&amp;rsquo;s vice president for energy and environmental policy, wrote that solar customers can still expect to pay off their system in seven years under the utility&amp;#39;s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under a 2013 law (AB 327), the CPUC has until the end of the year to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/fear-and-loathing-at-the-cpuc-california-debates-the-future-of-solar"&gt;create a successor &amp;ldquo;NEM 2.0&amp;rdquo; tariff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Solar advocates, including the state&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Dear-Gov.-Brown-Energy-and-Cleantech-VCs-Talk-NEM-Policy-in-Calif"&gt;leading cleantech investors&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/californias-solar-industry-fights-back-on-net-metering-2.0"&gt;pushing&lt;/a&gt; for regulators to keep solar incentives the same through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If California intends to maintain its role as leader in renewable energy, it will have to reject these proposals,&amp;rdquo; said Bryan Miller, vice president of policy at Sunrun. &amp;ldquo;Net energy metering exists in 44 states; South Carolina recently became the 44th. If California wants to be more regressive than South Carolina on renewable energy policies, it would accept these utilities&amp;rsquo; proposals. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s where California&amp;rsquo;s values are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Miller pointed to Arizona, where Salt River Project recently approved &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solarcity-files-lawsuit-against-salt-river-project-for-antitrust-violations"&gt;solar demand charges&lt;/a&gt;, and consequently solar installations fell by 95 percent. &amp;ldquo;There is a&amp;nbsp;dead body in Arizona, and utilities in California really like that result, and want to do the same thing,&amp;rdquo; said Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This debate comes after the &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Breaking-California-Reaches-Compromise-on-Utility-Residential-Rate-Reform"&gt;CPUC passed reforms&lt;/a&gt; to residential electricity rates in July, including a requirement for utilities to create time-of-use plans, a move to a two-tiered rate structure, and the rejection of fixed monthly charges in favor of a &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-the-massachusetts-net-metering-compromise-could-be-a-model-for-other-st"&gt;minimum bill&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/C_jGHXnYM24" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Video Breakdown: What Obamaâs Climate Rule Means for the Cleantech Industry</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/WbriwS68-5w/Video-Breakdown-What-Obamas-Climate-Rule-Really-Means-for-the-Cleantech-I</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Video-Breakdown-What-Obamas-Climate-Rule-Really-Means-for-the-Cleantech-I</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	On August 3, President Obama unveiled the &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/obama-administration-to-finalize-climate-rule-with-new-flexiblity-measures"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt;, calling it &amp;ldquo;the most important step America has taken in the fight against global climate change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rule calls for a 32 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030, compared to emissions levels in 2005. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also gave each state its own carbon reduction goal, based on the region&amp;#39;s energy mix and current emissions levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rule has been both &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-obamas-signature-climate-plan-really-that-ambitious"&gt;praised and criticized&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from all sides of the climate policy debate. But what does it mean for cleantech businesses? How much will it boost activity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this episode of Rewired, we discuss five major takeaways from the Clean Power Plan with Malcolm Woolf, senior vice president of policy and government affairs at Advanced Energy Economy.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Ambri to Cut Staff, Postpone Commercial Shipments to Hone Battery Design</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/-V5NPdlAYD0/Ambri-To-Cut-Staff-Postpone-Commercial-Shipments-to-Hone-Battery-Design</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Ambri-To-Cut-Staff-Postpone-Commercial-Shipments-to-Hone-Battery-Design</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	Getting an entirely new and novel battery chemistry to commercial scale is Sisyphean work. And Ambri, with its liquid metal battery technology, has just hit a large speed bump on its uphill climb to grid-scale energy storage domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CEO Phil Giudice sent out an update today reporting, "Unfortunately, we have not made the technology progress we had anticipated. As a result, we will not be delivering commercial prototype systems later this year or early next, as we had originally planned. Consequently, we have reduced our team by 14 colleagues." That&amp;#39;s approximately 25 percent of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ambri is a battery firm based on the research of Donald Sadoway, MIT professor of materials chemistry, and inspired by the economies of scale facilitated by modern electrometallurgy and the aluminum smelter. The big-battery startup has raised more than $50 million in venture capital from investors KLP Enterprises, &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/cleantech-investing/post/venture-capital-family-offices-and-the-drive-for-more-cleantech-success-sto"&gt;the family office&lt;/a&gt; of Karen Pritzker and Michael Vlock, Building Insurance Bern, &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/vinod-khosla-with-some-tough-love-for-energy-storage"&gt;Khosla Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Gates and French energy giant Total, along with plenty of MIT and government grant money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CEO continued, "Our reduction in staff and slowed commercialization path will provide us more time to solve the engineering challenges ahead of us before we re-engage in committing to commercial deployment schedules. Specifically, we are acutely focused on developing a robust high-temperature seal for our liquid metal battery. Our primary design of this component demonstrated promising results last fall and this spring, but did not perform sufficiently well under rigorous verification testing protocols which we ran this summer. We are now pursuing other seal designs that show initial promise, but it will take more time to confirm their viability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We spoke with the CEO today. He emphasized that "the basic science that&amp;#39;s been demonstrated continues to look phenomenal, with an extremely low fade rate." According to the company, "Cells have cycled thousands of times in in-house tests with negligible fade on full depth of discharge cycling, extrapolating that after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles the batteries will retain 98 percent capacity availability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CEO added, "It&amp;#39;s not a reset." He said that the company&amp;#39;s investors are still all in and that there is two years&amp;#39; worth of capital on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to his update, "Ambri&amp;rsquo;s board and investors share our disappointment that progress has not happened more quickly or easily, but fully understand the accomplishments we have achieved, the challenges we face and Ambri&amp;lsquo;s potential. The market opportunity for grid-scale energy storage is large, growing and global. Bringing new scientific discoveries in the physical sciences to commercial success is hard; the process is not entirely knowable or amenable to predictable timelines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In March of last year, we reported on a presentation given by Ambri&amp;#39;s David Bradwell at &lt;a href="http://infocastinc.com/events/storageweek14/agenda" target="_blank"&gt;Infocast&amp;#39;s Energy Storage Week&lt;/a&gt;. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="422" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri1.jpg" width="561" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prototype units started as the "shot glass," followed by the 3-inch, 20-watt-hour "hockey puck," and then by the 6-inch, 200-watt-hour "saucer." The commercialized product will use a 6-inch square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="430" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri2.jpg" width="578" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bradwell notes that the batteries achieve 1,000 cycles of continuous deep cycling with negligible fade. There are no moving parts, pumps or valves in the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="429" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri3.jpg" width="566" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cell is contained in a 4-inch-by-4-inch stamped stainless steel housing with no nanoscale microstructures or difficult-to-synthesize materials, according to the co-founder. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="400" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri4.jpg" width="531" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cells have a DC-to-DC efficiency of 80 percent at a five-hour charge/discharge rate and an AC-to-AC efficiency of 70 percent to 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="417" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri5.jpg" width="557" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" height="431" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/ambri6.jpg" width="578" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bradwell noted that all manufacturing processes and robotic cell assembly had to be developed by Ambri. He claims that the technology has a lower manufacturing cost and lower employee-per-square-foot-of-factory ratio than that of lithium-ion battery technology. The CTO also suggested that Ambri&amp;#39;s pricing will fall between that of pumped hydro and compressed-air energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>California Launches Its First Real-World Smart Inverter Test</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/LkSIfyuTmvk/california-launches-its-first-real-world-smart-inverter-test</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-launches-its-first-real-world-smart-inverter-test</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	Rooftop PV and behind-the-meter batteries can team up to reduce customer energy bills, shave off expensive peaks in building energy consumption, and store midday solar-generated electrons for evening discharge to help smooth out their impact on the grid. But more complicated functions, like balancing voltage on distribution grid circuits, or disconnecting and reconnecting to the grid for emergency backup power, require a third technology: smart inverters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On Thursday, the SunSpec Alliance, the University of California-San Diego, and SolarCity &lt;a href="http://sunspec.org/cec-pon-14-303/" target="_blank"&gt;launched a project&lt;/a&gt; meant to test this emerging standard for advanced inverter functionality. It&amp;rsquo;s the first real-world test of a technology set to be mandated for all new solar and battery projects in California in 2016, a fact that&amp;rsquo;s drawn some of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest inverter makers into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have an ensemble cast of partners here,&amp;rdquo; SunSpec Alliance chairman Tom Tansy said. Funded by a $2 million California Energy Commission EPIC grant, the $4 million project will run interoperability tests featuring inverters from seven different global manufacturers -- ABB, SMA, KACO, Outback, SolarEdge, Enphase and Ideal Power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Starting late this year, each company will submit their smart inverters, along with chosen battery and solar integration partners, to testing by UCSD. The university&amp;rsquo;s state-of-the-art microgrid, which includes pretty much every form of distributed energy known to humanity, will provide a useful control and renewable power resource for the testing, Tansy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;ll prove out our communications interoperability, via the SunSpec standard,&amp;rdquo; he said. &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/duke-lines-up-behind-mesa-standard-for-energy-storage"&gt;SunSpec and partners have built a set of standards&lt;/a&gt; around linking inverters with components like batteries, solar panels, and energy management systems. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ll be doing things like curtailment, voltage regulation, frequency regulation, both on power from the solar array and from storage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Almost all of today&amp;rsquo;s solar and battery inverters come with advanced features that fit this description of &amp;ldquo;smart.&amp;rdquo; But very few companies are turning them on, let alone communicating with utilities and grid operators about what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and what they&amp;rsquo;re capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s largely because most utility and grid regulatory frameworks haven&amp;rsquo;t kept up with distributed energy&amp;rsquo;s growth. There isn&amp;rsquo;t even an Underwriters Laboratories specification for smart inverters yet, although a &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-closes-in-on-smart-solar-inverter-rules"&gt;California-led group is working with UL and inverter makers&lt;/a&gt; to fill that gap by next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	UCSD is also providing its digital models of its distribution circuits -- the campus is like a grid in miniature, and submetered to an unusual degree for public buildings. OSIsoft, the biggest provider of data management software for utility SCADA deployments and other resources of circuit-level data, is participating in that part of the project as well, he said. Project partners will also pull data from the distribution circuit maps newly unveiled by the state&amp;rsquo;s big three utilities, including UCSD&amp;rsquo;s utility, San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broader goal is &amp;ldquo;to see how deeply a circuit can be penetrated,&amp;rdquo; he said. At most utilities, &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s an artificial cap of about 15 percent of the total demand capacity that can be offset with renewable energy&amp;rdquo; and other distributed energy resources (DERs), he said, in terms of how much a distribution grid circuit can bear before causing potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But tests at Department of Energy labs, and analyses of real-world circuit data in DER-rich grid locales &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/HECO-and-SolarCity-to-Put-Smart-Solar-Inverters-Through-Real-World-Testing"&gt;in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and California, indicate that many circuits can bear a much higher portion of distributed energy -- and even benefit from it -- as long as it&amp;rsquo;s planned and managed well. CEC&amp;rsquo;s grant request form (&lt;a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/business_meetings/2015_packets/2015-04-08/Item_20c_EPC-14-036_SunSpec_Alliance.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) describes the project&amp;rsquo;s goals: &amp;ldquo;To develop a complete smart inverter data communication standardization and go-to-market solution to enable photovoltaic (PV) penetration beyond the 15% Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) guideline, incorporate energy storage as a standard building block of PV systems, and evaluate the market-expansion potential of a standardized communication interface.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;SolarCity&amp;rsquo;s energy-smart neighborhood, plus virtual power plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to SolarCity&amp;rsquo;s part in the project, which is distinct from the UCSD work. The aggregator of hundreds of thousands of solar systems across California will seek out about 50 customers on a specific test circuit of Southern California Edison&amp;rsquo;s sprawling distribution grid, and equip each with a lithium-ion battery system, capable of providing roughly 7 to 10 kilowatt-hours of storage, Tansy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That just happens to also be the range of specs for Tesla&amp;rsquo;s new Powerwall home energy storage systems, by the way. Ryan Hanley, senior director of grid operations for SolarCity, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say which battery and inverter partners the company planned to work with on the project, which is set to start some time early next year. But SolarCity is &amp;ldquo;cost-sharing more than we&amp;rsquo;re getting from the grant -- we&amp;rsquo;re putting up more in R&amp;amp;D and program support than we&amp;rsquo;re receiving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are going down to one circuit and finding 50 residential customers, and deploying 50 smart energy homes on that circuit,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;In each home, we&amp;rsquo;ve got solar PV, a smart inverter, a residential battery, and a smart thermostat.&amp;rdquo; That last control point allows access to air conditioning, a key ingredient of household electricity load that could provide more flexibility in absorbing and redirecting solar power. Think of precooling a home with plentiful solar energy, and &amp;ldquo;storing&amp;rdquo; that cool to let the AC idle through the late afternoons and early evenings, when large swaths of Southern California circuits reach their peak, for example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the inverter-grid interconnection front, SolarCity plans to provide three main services with its aggregated 350 to 500 kilowatt-hours of storage. &amp;ldquo;The first one we&amp;rsquo;ll do is support voltage needs on the feeder,&amp;rdquo; he said -- something that requires advanced inverter functions to operate in concert with each other and utility-facing grid sensors and controls. Second, 50 homes will also support local capacity needs for the substation serving the circuit, much as SCE&amp;rsquo;s local capacity resource procurements are doing with storage from Stem, Ice Energy/NRG and Advanced Microgrid Solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The third one, which is my favorite, is we&amp;rsquo;re aggregating all 50 of those systems and providing wholesale grid support,&amp;rdquo; Hanley&amp;nbsp;said, through the Proxy Demand Resource demand-response program run by grid operator CAISO. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s of note here is that it&amp;rsquo;s a heterogeneous portfolio. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve aggregated different technologies and bid them into CAISO. The rules were just recently changed to allow this,&amp;rdquo; he said, with a big demand-response auction set for later this year, and rules for how distributed assets can play in DR markets&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Californias-Demand-Response-2.0-Creates-New-Competitive-Markets"&gt;still under development&lt;/a&gt; for rollout over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SolarCity&amp;rsquo;s control platform, which manages its small but growing &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solarcitys-plan-for-tesla-batteries-share-grid-revenues-with-homeowners"&gt;fleet of Tesla battery-backed&lt;/a&gt; solar homes and businesses, will also control this 50-home fleet as a virtual power plant, capable of responding to utility signals and, in some instances, turning themselves &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/should-utilities-own-solar-inverters"&gt;over to utility control&lt;/a&gt;, he said. The combination of customer and utility benefits from this arrangement are complex, and &amp;ldquo;part of the goal of the project is to quantify that,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SolarCity isn&amp;rsquo;t the first to bid behind-the-meter battery flexibility into California&amp;rsquo;s grid markets -- behind-the-meter startup &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/aggregating-building-batteries-into-grid-resources"&gt;Stem has done that&lt;/a&gt; in pilot projects in the past two years. Nor is it the first to test solar-battery grid support and load shifting capabilities. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District has a &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/will-utilities-control-behind-the-meter-solar-batteries"&gt;big residential solar-battery test&lt;/a&gt; underway. Southern California Edison has the stimulus-grant-funded Irvine smart grid demonstration test bed, and California&amp;rsquo;s big three IOUs want to do many more pilots over the next few years as part of their &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/independents-to-calif-utilities-more-grid-edge-data-please"&gt;distribution resource plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the project SolarCity is part of is the first to use the standard smart inverter specification so soon to become a mandatory part of California&amp;rsquo;s new solar fleets. UCSD&amp;rsquo;s inverter tests will serve as a blueprint for SolarCity to interconnect its various distributed energy assets, Hanley said, although it&amp;rsquo;s not planning to test every new inverter in its 50-home pilot -- &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll probably be using one inverter, maybe two,&amp;rdquo; although that could expand over time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More broadly speaking, &amp;ldquo;we believe the industry is better off the sooner smart inverters are widely deployed, and we want to do everything we can to accelerate that,&amp;rdquo; he said. California is in the midst of reworking its utility regulations to &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-sets-the-stage-for-radical-grid-edge-integration"&gt;bring DERs into play with utility grid&lt;/a&gt; operations and planning, and stand in for part of utilities&amp;#39; multi-billion-dollar investment plans, to reward what they do for the state&amp;#39;s renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. The sooner advanced inverter functionality is part of that DER market, the faster new rules and markets will evolve to express that value in terms of kWh and kVAR, and eventually, dollars and cents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/LkSIfyuTmvk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Could Fuel Cells Solve the Emissions Problem for Coal Plants?</title>
			<link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~3/WlbdMH2EURQ/Could-Fuel-Cells-Solve-the-Emissions-Problem-for-Coal-Plants</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Could-Fuel-Cells-Solve-the-Emissions-Problem-for-Coal-Plants</guid>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;
	With a little extra engineering work, some researchers believe fuel cells could become one of the most affordable ways for coal plants to keep their doors open as pollution regulations tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Department of Energy selected FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCE) last week as one of &lt;a href="http://energy.gov/fe/articles/doe-selects-eight-projects-receive-funding-reducing-cost-co2-capture-and-compression"&gt;eight funding recipients&lt;/a&gt; to pilot low-cost carbon dioxide capture and compression technologies. The $23.7 million project (with $15 million coming from the DOE and $8.7 million from FCE) will see a 2-megawatt fuel cell deployed at a coal-fired power plant designed to capture about 60 tons of CO2 per day, while simultaneously producing about 40,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This &lt;a href="http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/assets/Tech-Spotlight-Carbon-Capture.pdf"&gt;first-of-its-kind application&lt;/a&gt; is a modification to FCE&amp;rsquo;s existing Direct FuelCell technology, which the company says has already generated more than 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Researchers have been exploring the use of fuel cells for carbon capture since the early 1990s, but only recently has the technology declined enough in cost to be seriously considered as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Carbon capture only works with a molten carbonate fuel cell, a chemistry that relies on CO2 to operate. Flue gas from a coal plant contains 5 percent to 15 percent CO2, with the remainder made up largely of nitrogen, as well as other gases. In FCE&amp;rsquo;s application, the flue gas is routed into the fuel cell at one electrode, where the cell selectively takes up the CO2 and releases it in a concentrated stream at the other electrode. During this process, approximately 70 percent of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the CO2 is captured, it&amp;rsquo;s cooled and compressed utilizing standard refrigeration equipment. The purified carbon can then be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.greentechmedia.com//content/images/articles/FCE_carbon_capture_diagram.png" style="width: 580px; height: 301px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;#39;s commercially available carbon-capture technology has proven to be &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/southern-company-is-raising-rates-18-to-pay-for-its-carbon-capture-plant"&gt;extremely expensive&lt;/a&gt; and energy-intensive, nearly doubling the cost of electricity from a coal-fired power plant. FCE&amp;rsquo;s technology also increases the cost of electricity from coal-fired power plants, but the DOE believes that increase could be one-third or less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At an estimated cost of $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, these second generation technologies are showing they could potentially achieve a 30 percent increase in the cost of electricity, which is a significant drop compared to today&amp;rsquo;s commercially available technologies,&amp;rdquo; said Jos&amp;eacute; Figueroa, senior carbon capture project manager at the DOE, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The challenge of emissions reduction has always been to find a proven technology that&amp;rsquo;s affordable, and that&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to deploy, as opposed to spending billions,&amp;rdquo; said Arthur Bottone, CEO of FCE. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve met that challenge with our solution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As states act to meet their compliance obligations under the EPA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/obama-administration-to-finalize-climate-rule-with-new-flexiblity-measures"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt;, several stakeholders will seek new technologies to clean up their coal plants. FCE has only tested its carbon-capture technology in the lab to date, but the application is already the attracting interest from the power industry and legislators in states with a high reliance on coal, said Bottone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Questions about efficiency, scale, climate impact and cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	FCE is currently evaluating multiple sites for the DOE-supported pilot with interested utility and independent power producers, and it expects to announce the site selection this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the selection criteria is that there needs to be a nearby supply of natural gas to power the fuel cell. Molten carbonate fuel cells take in CO2, but still need a fuel source to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chiller used to condense CO2 also needs a power source. To meet that demand, the system is outfitted with a 2.8-megawatt fuel cell, which the chiller brings down to around 2 megawatts of actual power output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even with these extra steps, Bottone said the fuel cell application is much more efficient than other carbon-capture technologies. Rather than drain productivity at the power plant, FCE&amp;rsquo;s technology generates additional power -- and revenue -- in exchange for the energy it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is a power generation device that concentrates CO2 at the same time. It&amp;rsquo;s a completely different thought process, versus a device that&amp;rsquo;s doing nothing but capturing CO2,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re multitasking on the same asset as compared to a different way of doing it, which would only be a cost and not necessarily a benefit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This dual use makes the project easily financeable by private capital, because the electricity generated by the fuel cell creates a reliable revenue stream, Bottone added. Selling the purified CO2 for use in other applications like enhanced oil recovery would create additional revenue, although FCE didn&amp;rsquo;t factor those sales into its financial modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another benefit is that the technology is modular, so it can be scaled up incrementally as funding becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	FCE sees the DOE-supported pilot as the first phase of a much larger project. In the second phase, once the application engineering is established, FCE will seek private capital to install 11 additional fuel-cell power plants. This 25-megawatt system is expected to capture a total of 700 tons of carbon dioxide per day, while generating about 648,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a 500-megawatt coal plant, 25 megawatts of fuel cells would reduce emissions by between 5 percent and 6 percent, said Bottone. Under the Clean Power Plan, emissions have to fall by roughly 3 percent over a 10-year period. So by installing FCE&amp;rsquo;s technology in phases, a coal-plant operator could meet the 32 percent overall emissions reduction target in a few years, while adding about 100 megawatts of power generation to its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;On paper, it&amp;rsquo;s a massive market opportunity,&amp;rdquo; said Bottone. &amp;ldquo;The question is how fast we can go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We think that given the significant assurance of the technology we&amp;rsquo;ve developed for other businesses, we can go pretty quick, not to mention the fact that some of these utility customers and others are already our customers,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;So the business model, and the confidence in us, frankly, is already there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But several questions remain. For one thing, while the system captures CO2 from the natural gas fed into the fuel cell, as well as from the coal plant itself, there are still concerns about the net climate benefit because of the emissions associated with natural gas production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are similar concerns with enhanced oil recovery. Pumping CO2 underground could help unlock new oil resources, and the CO2 could then be sequestered underground once the reservoir is depleted. But the net benefit is unclear, since the carbon sequestration would be offset by the continued use of oil. Plus, there&amp;rsquo;s the added complexity of getting the CO2 to the oil well to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another issue is that flue gas from a coal plant contains pollutants, such as sulfur and chlorine, that could degrade the fuel-cell stack over time. How much FCE&amp;rsquo;s application ultimately costs will depend on how much the coal plant exhaust has to be cleaned up before it enters the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;A coal-fired power plant has a lot of environmental control systems to meet environmental regulations, so those emissions are very low. But fuel cells are still sensitive to many contaminants, and so the flue gas would have to go through a polishing step to get it to even lower contaminant levels before getting to the fuel cell,&amp;rdquo; said Figueroa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lab tests to date show that the fuel cell sees little degradation using a simulated polished gas, but more testing is needed to see how the fuel cell performs in real world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Understand this technology is still at a small scale,&amp;rdquo; said Figueroa. &amp;ldquo;Conceptual cost estimates, versus what it will look like at a 500-megawatt scale, with all of the flue gas that needs to be processed at that level, can differ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that can still happen as you scale up and that&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re performing more research, and that takes time,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GTM_Efficiency/~4/WlbdMH2EURQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
