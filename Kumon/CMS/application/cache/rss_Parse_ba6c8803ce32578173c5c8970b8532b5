<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Handhelds, wearables and more: Smaller medical devices mean smaller, multi-tasking connectors</strong></span></h3>
<p>New technology in connector design is changing how medical device manufacturers build smaller, more reliable devices than ever before. One approach is the increased use of small hybrid connectors that combine signal, power, and data into one small, dense connector.</p>
<p>This is particularly helpful when the patient is responsible for maintaining the device on a daily basis. Patients who are not technologically proficient bring their own set of challenges and risks to the table, especially when their own failing health plays a role. The fewer the connections and cables that have to be managed, the lower the risk of an in-home device problem due to user error.</p>
<p>Suppliers constantly work with engineers designing handheld or wearable connector solutions that take up less space and handle a broader range of functions. The most common is putting power and signal into one connector. But there are other combinations, such as power and fluid or air, specifically in the medical industry that play a role as well. Those engineers report that their end-use customers ask for simplicity and ease-of-use while still maintaining safety, reliability, and FDA-level or appropriate country medical device directive quality standards. It is no small task to satisfy everyone.</p>
<p>Moving from the older, larger connectors that handle only signal or only power to smaller connectors that handle both power and signal comes with a bit of a learning curve. The problem is that most engineers donât get the chance to review their connector solutions all that often, especially when they need to pass FDA trials. However, reviewing the connector and cable assembly needs and possibilities early in a project can save a lot of heartache later on.</p>
<p>If the connector solution is typically connected and then forgotten, those working on new designs have myriad solutions available. They can minimize the number of wires coming out of the connector to make sure medical professionals or patients can easily handle the single connection. In some instances, they donât need to worry a lot about how the connectors feel, or whether they are easy to connect and disconnect over a period of time. When connectors arenât touched very often, itâs important to make sure the signal and power connections donât create interference and are as small as possible.</p>
<p>But if the connector solution is mated and unmated often, the end user and the environment must be closely examined. For instance, a solution in a hospital surgical environment where staff is wearing gloves will have different needs than connectors for a patient in poor health who canât grasp small connectors.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Here are a few tips to consider when going to a hybrid connector solution that multi-tasks in a frequent-use application.</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sure, itâs easy to determine the contact count. But details become more important as the voltage and current increases. Compare models for the exact size of the contact. A 0.5mm contact will carry more power than a 0.3mm contact. The smaller the contact, the lower the current it will pass. Early connector failures can occur if too much power is run through a small contact.</li>
<li>Pin density and configuration are important. The ideal connector performs several functions including transmission of power, Ethernet, HDMI, etc., without interference. The cable plays a significant role, but connectors without the proper spacing may play havoc with data transmission if there are unexpected levels of interference. Combinations of data, signal and power need to be tested as no two applications are exactly the same.</li>
<li>Check for available keying and color-coding variations so that users can quickly and easily determine where to connect a specific cable.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Review for overall ruggedness:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to get enough mating cycles out of the connectors. If 5,000 mating cycles are needed, make sure the connector solution can handle them. Determine how many mating cycles per day are expected and the probable product lifetime to come up with a target for the minimum required mating cycles.</li>
<li>Check to make sure that connector can be sealed to product requirements. Not every IP68 solution is created equally. IP68 can be achieved with a test of one meter for two hours or 120 meters for 24 hours. Thereâs a big difference, so take the time to understand whatâs behind every providerâs IP68 testing. On the other hand, donât pay for sealing levels that arenât needed.</li>
<li>When sterilization is an issue, be sure to understand which sterilization method will be used. Different methods need connectors with different materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Cable configurations:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be sure that the cable selected works best for the application. Not every cable with multiple twisted pairs is the same. If a specific data speed is required, be sure to specify it.</li>
<li>With todayâs smaller connectors, be sure that the cable and connector actually mate. People often ask for cables that are too big for the connectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with hybrid connectors doesnât end with traditional copper connectors. Many companies offer fiber-copper hybrid connectors and cables to move a lot of data a long way and provide power.</p>
<p>So what is the payoff? Customers have been able to make substantial changes to designs by making hybrid connectors part of their solution. Replacing two connectors with one lowers the total cost of ownership. It simplifies design, and makes the systems more efficient, and maybe â just maybe â makes everyone a little happier.</p>

This revolution is not being spurred directly by innovations in sensor technology or other hardware, but rather by innovations in software and in data collection, aggregation, and analysis that can make even apparently mundane information useful in improving healthcare outcomes and patient care.</p>
<p><strong>Medicine Gets Data-Hungry</strong></p>
<p>Before this shift in data collection and analysis, sensors could provide a variety of patient metrics like pulse rate, blood pressure, and EEG, but were mostly limited to monitoring, particularly in clinical settings. With nowhere for vast amounts of data to be stored, no way to access it if it were stored, and no effective way to analyze it, sensors remained in the critical but limited role of reactive monitoring.</p>
<p>Today, data collected by those same types of sensors, now interconnected, can be stored in the cloud and made accessible to patients, doctors, and even researchers, and can be analyzed and monitored automatically. Sensors are becoming part of a proactive healthcare effort rather than being merely reactive.</p>
<p>One thing thatâs changing is the emergence of a new market for wearable monitoring products. They leverage compact sensors and connectors, often including wireless devices and some processing capabilities as well. That requires compact and fairly inexpensive sensors and connectors.</p>
<p>What this means from a hardware perspective is that sensors and the data they collect have gotten a lot more valuable. This is true in nearly every industry, but healthcare is unique in its high stakes nature and complex regulatory environment. Makers of sensor components and supporting connectors and other hardware have a massive business and research opportunity, but meeting industry demand and regulatory requirements will be a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Decades of Experience</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, sensor and connector companies are not starting at square one. As in many industries that are seeing the business and research potential of data analytics, the underlying sensors in many healthcare settings have been in place for a long time. MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) components have been in use since the 1970s, using tiny structures micromachined in silicon to convert mechanical factors like a patientâs heartbeat to electrical signals and data.</p>
<p>Sensors for healthcare applications, including MEMS components, continue to shrink and improve, encouraged at least in part by the heightened role of data in health decisions and the patient experience.</p>
<p>Components like Analog Devicesâ AD8232, a single-lead heart rate monitor for ECG and other biopotential measurement applications, are using less power and making monitoring less obtrusive than their predecessors. These newest sensors, including the AD8232, are being created with wearables in mind, enabling designers to include them quickly and easily in an expanding range of products.</p>
<p>With data becoming more useful and valuable, the demand is strong for hardware innovations enabling wearability and implantability of medical devices; but the demand for health-related sensors wonât come entirely from the healthcare industry itself.</p>
<p><strong>Bundles of Sensors</strong></p>
<p>Industries are finding new ways to collect more and more valuable sensor data every day by putting sensors in everything. Much of this is sold to consumers on the basis of convenience or personal interest, like the accelerometer-derived fitness data collected by FitBits and iPhones. Sensors like STMicroelectronicsâ LIS331DLH 3-axis digital accelerometer are part of the latest generation of continually shrinking MEMS sensors being included in consumer products like smartphones.</p>
<p>The practical upshot of this widespread inclusion of connected sensors in consumer products is that their data can eventually be aggregated with and augment more formal medical data to become an important diagnostic and research tool. With data aggregation, nearly every sensor could potentially have medical applications.</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Testing</strong></p>
<p>Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest HMOs in the United States, is actively working to put these principles of data aggregation, analysis, and reporting into practical use. One of the goals of the companyâs Garfield Center for Innovation is to provide a testing ground where new technologies can be tested and developed under the stresses of a real hospital environment.</p>
<p>One of the issues being studied at the Garfield Center is a direct result of the pervasiveness of connected sensors: alarms. In the monitoring role of healthcare sensors, machines are capable of alerting hospital staff to emergency situations. However, false alarms produced by these sensors and machines are a major source of fatigue and distraction; in these cases, more information could actually mean worse patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Major healthcare companies like GE and Philips are all developing advanced software systems for what they call âalarm management.â Algorithms and automated monitoring can reduce the number of false alarms referred to hospital staff, improving their work environment and enabling them to serve patients better.</p>
<p>Kaiserâs Garfield Center is helping bring these innovations to real-world use more quickly. In an industry with high stakes, confirming a technologyâs effectiveness before it goes into use is critical.</p>
<p>âWe look at the technology in a level of detail thatâs not possible anywhere else,â said Trevor Hogberg, Executive Director, Facilities Strategic Solutions &amp; Clinical Operations at the Garfield Center. âWe ran somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500 different test cases on how an alarm can be generated, processed, and reacted to by a human being, and we made sure that, one, the technology was sound, but two, that the workflow processes were optimalâ.</p>
<p>Without software innovations that can automate the handling of data, and computing and data storage technologies that mean sensor data can be used to enhance patient outcomes and fuel research, the large scale expansion of the use of sensors would remain impractical. Because of these software, computing, and storage advances, the demand for sensors, connectors and their supporting hardware will continue to grow.</p>

<p>Every day, medical device manufacturers get better and better at managing risk as they respond to international regulatory schemes that impact device design all the way down to the component level. Perhaps the most fundamental and wide-ranging of these has been the emergence and adoption of formal risk management methodologies.</p>
<p>ISO14971, Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices, is the international standard for applying risk management principles to the medical devices in major markets including the US, Australia, Canada, the EU, and Japan.</p>
<p>In the US, manufacturers are looking closer at components and materials, documenting risks for FDA inspection. This ISO standard has altered product selection methods and requirements for electronic components like connectors and cabling.</p>
<p>For years, US regulations acknowledged differences in the type and level of risk represented by medical technologies. The FDAâs Center for Devices and Radiological Health shapes the regulatory processes for permitting devices to enter the marketplace in accordance their risk.</p>
<p>There are three risk levels, Class I, II and III, with Class I at the lowest risk and Class III representing the highest risk level.</p>
<p>In the European Union, medical products are regulated through three ânew approachâ directives that were enacted during the 1990s. To receive the CE mark, products must satisfy the âessential requirementsâ established by the applicable directive.</p>
<p>Like the FDAâs classification system, the CE marking system also relies on a risk-stratified approach, applying such criteria as the duration of body contact, invasive character, use of an energy source, effect on the central circulation or nervous system, or diagnostic impact, to determine the level of risk. ISO 13485, Quality Management SystemsâRequirements for Regulatory Purposes, is another important standard.</p>
<p>IEC 60601 also addresses medical electrical equipment. The standard has been brought into alignment with the industryâs broad regulatory trends to a risk management approach.</p>
<p>Manufacturers will experience this shift in these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A productâs essential performance characteristics must be examined in relation to criteria needed to avoid unacceptable risk.</li>
<li>The manufacturerâs process for complying with IEC 60601-1 must itself be in compliance withÂ ISO 14971.</li>
<li>A risk management file will be required for every product. The 3rd edition of IECÂ 60601-1 also revises technical requirements in areas ranging from mechanical hazards such as crushing or instability to the application of alarm systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact on connectors</h3>
<p>Virtually every one of the standardâs sections incorporates subsections that have special importance for the field of medical connectors. An example of the standardâs new and important technical requirements for connectors can be seen if we drill down even further.</p>
<p>Illustrated here are the standardâs definitions and new requirements for creepage distance and air clearance, which are essential for distinguishing the means of patient protection (MOPP) from the means of operator protection (MOOP) required for a particular device.</p>
<p>To comply with the requirements of the new edition of IEC 60601-1, manufacturers will need to assess how creepage and air clearance in their connectors affects the risks associated with their products. To accomplish that, developers need to know how creepage and air clearance are measured.</p>
<p>Shown here are a couple examples from the IEC rules that are used to clarify the way that creepage and air clearance are measured under the new requirements of IEC 60601-1 (3rd ed.).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16978" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/creepage-and-clearance-requirements.gif" alt="Creepage and clearance requirements" width="335" height="169" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In todayâs increasingly IT-enabled and interoperable world of medical devices, electrical connectors are playing a vital role in advancing product capabilities. They are also an important element that must be addressed whenever a manufacturer develops a risk assessment profile for a new or updated device.</p>
<p>Worldwide trends in medical device regulation favor the convergence of risk stratification, quality systems, and risk management approaches. Manufacturers will bear responsibility for conducting risk management processes in compliance with applicable standards. Working with qualified suppliers will facilitate manufacturersâ compliance with quality systems and risk management requirements.</p>

Changes in the electronic equipment prompt the development of connectors and cabling to fit and perform in new environments and packages.</h2>
<p><div class="woo-sc-twitter left"><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div> <script type="IN/Share" ></script>

 <a href="https://secure.campaigner.com/CSB/Public/Form.aspx?fid=1153473"><img class="alignnone wp-image-14527 size-full" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/Subscribe-g80.gif" alt="Subscribe-g80" width="80" height="20" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Â </strong></span></p>
<p>The need for small size and low weight have always been important for aircraft and spacecraft. Those requirements are now becoming more important as earthbound military users require more portability. Connectors are critical elements in systems that must be rugged enough to survive unique environments as diverse as personal watercraft, drones, and helmet cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_16938" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-16938 size-full" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/Nano-circular-25mil-Pitch.gif" alt="Nano-circular 25mil pitch connectors" width="240" height="167" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nano Circular at 25 mil. Pitch</p></div>
<p>To support portable equipment, connectors must be smaller in size and diameter. Increasingly, these connectors mate with round cables that carry signals and power. Circular connectors are a natural shape for many panel interface connections because they take less front panel space than rectangular connectors and can support rapid plug and unplug connections for fast and easy instrument mating. They are often available in a number of mate and lock formats to serve various needs.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16935" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/circular-connectors.gif" alt="circular connectors" width="195" height="131" />Systems being used in extreme environments also expand the challenge for circular connector design. For example, space qualified connectors must often be shielded from electromagnetic interference and avoid polymer outgassing as well as being extremely lightweight. Military applications require improved plating materials such as nickel plated aluminum, or the newer nickel/Teflon overcoating to help resist corrosion. Â Shock and vibration resistance is essential to maintain signal integrity simultaneously with signal speed increasing and voltage swings decreasing.</p>
<div id="attachment_16936" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-16936" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/dts-circular-connectors.gif" alt="DTS Data Acquisiton" width="250" height="185" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo courtesy of DTS Data Acquisition Systems</p></div>
<p>To meet todayâs demand for small diameter connectors, many manufacturers are scaling down older designs. One way to observe changes in connector size is to note the pin sizes and current carrying capacity. Â For example, the popular Mil-DTL-38999 Circular connector uses 18-20 size pins to carry up to 12 Amps on 20 AWG wiring.</p>
<p>This year, a smaller 38999 connector is being standardized by a number of companies working with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).This down-sized mil spec version will be a smaller, more universally available circular connector with a triple-start thread coupling system. It will also mate quickly and have EMI shielding.</p>
<p>This new standard will likely use size 23 pins and handle about 10 Amps on 20-22 AWG wire. Companies already offer micro-circular connectors with size 24 pin/sockets that support 3 Amps on 24-30 AWG wire. Some of the smallest circular connectors use size 30 pins, support 1 Amp and 30-32 AWG wiring. Pinâto-pin spacing drops from over 75 mils to 25 mils. This reduces the diameter of both the connector and the cable. Cable flexibility improves simultaneously.</p>
<div id="attachment_16937" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-16937" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/gigabit-circular-connectors.gif" alt="" width="250" height="160" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gigabit Speeds with Power</p></div>
<p>In addition to physical changes, systems and circular connectors are going through an electronic renaissance. Many new circuits are using solid state chips that operate on significantly lower voltage and current levels and now run at digital gigabit speeds. High speed surveillance, and image displays demand this technology, similar to the consumer industry demanding faster TVs, computers, gaming devices, etc.</p>
<p>Consider a satellite taking photos as it orbits earth at 7,000 miles per hour. Each photo takes a minimum of 30 megapixels for one frame. The camera runs at 30 to 60 frames per second. The download of the images then end up using more than 7 gigabits/second. A connector and cable must support that signal speed and quality from the camera to its storage or transmission module. Note also that the request is that the connector and cable must be light weight and rugged as well as withstand constant temperature changes as it passes from sunlight to the cold darkness of space.</p>
<div id="attachment_16934" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-16934" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/black-diamond-soldier-mixed-signal.gif" alt="" width="250" height="123" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Black Diamond Advanced Technologyâs Soldier Mixed Signal systems</p></div>
<p>These connectors now include power within the same cable to reduce size and weight. The new connector designations are still evolving, but seem to be settling at SWaP-R or SWaP-C, acronyms for speed, weight, power, and either cost or reliability. SWaP connectors are used in diverse applications such as radios and computer systems on the soldierâs uniform.</p>
<p>There are at least two key trends. The first is size reduction and standardization. Creating a standard allows for multiple connector suppliers to participate and for customers to select models that best fit their design needs.</p>
<p>The other change is the expanding use of modeling as developers strive to meet changing demand for efficiency in the design of products that are lightweight and fit in small, unique spaces. Often, customers want a group of mixed signal plus power connectors and cable systems. Â Cable companies and connector companies are beginning to work together to meet this need. Â With use of solid modeling and direct communication between customers and suppliers, itâs easier to achieve both fast turn-around and good performance.</p>
<p>Cables are often pre-tested for eye diagram performance at the high digital speeds and leading connector suppliers offer high speed wiring protocol and data to support the changes. Â Connectors are indeed getting smaller and more complex as our electronic appetite pushes connectivity systems to satisfy those needs.</p>

<p><div class="woo-sc-twitter left"><a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button"data-count="horizontal">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div> <script type="IN/Share" ></script>

 <a href="https://secure.campaigner.com/CSB/Public/Form.aspx?fid=1153473"><img class="alignnone wp-image-14527 size-full" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/Subscribe-g80.gif" alt="Subscribe-g80" width="80" height="20" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-15533 size-medium" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/MQ9-Reaper-UAV-300x221.gif" width="300" height="221" /></p>
<p>Smaller and lighter components are allowing designers to give military UAVs more capabilities, and have brought previously exclusively military technologies like UAV-mounted cameras to consumer drones. As sensor technology gets smaller, lighter, and cheaper, more and more mechanical processes can be taken over by electronics. Even more importantly for the hardware component industry, including manufacturers of connectors and cables, more and more human-directed UAV activity will be automated, making additional electronic systems and sensors more prolific.</p>
<p>These expanding UAV sensor arrays inevitably require more cabling and connectors, with a concurrent demand for shrinking size and weight. Currently, designers are meeting these challenges with multi-port connectors, particularly the MIL-DTL-38999 Series III types. These MIL-standard, vibration, shock, and moisture resistant connectors significantly reduce redundant shielding and connector weight associated with using separate cables, and can also improve reliability and shielding.</p>
<p>These kinds of multi-port connectors have a long history of use in harsh environments for military and aerospace applications. Their use in UAVs is a prime example of how the success and speed of implementation of new technologies is built on the creative use of proven cable and connector components. In fact, the history of multi-pin circular connectors dates all the way back to the 1930s and the aviation demands brought about by World War II. Remarkably, aviation electronics went from just a few (comparatively crude) engine ignition parts in World War I to sophisticated, rugged circular connectors enabling projects like the Apollo missions just half a century later.</p>
<p>These Industrial Age innovations were driven by brute force: during World War II, defense had entire economies and workforces at its disposal, and the trend continued into the Cold War and Space Race. In the Information Age, rather than from brute force, innovations will come because automation and interconnection is actually making sensors and their supporting cables and connectors cheaper by reducing human involvement. The past century has shown, and consumer drones remind us now, that products built by defense contractors today will find their way into the next generation of consumer products.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Delegating Brain Tasks</strong></span></h3>
<p>In many contexts, computing power is replacing brain power, as direct human control is being given over to automation. Early military UAVs had to be connected via satellite because a person on the ground controls it. With more and richer sensor data available, together with advances in automation, the primary reason for connectedness is the sharing of valuable sensor data. Eventually, âunmannedâ will take on new meaning as direct human control over UAVs continues to diminish. The practical upshot of this is that UAVs will become much less expensive to operate and will allow personnel to focus more and more on the strategic big picture.</p>
<p>In military applications, the ethics of complete automation are understandably controversial, but the same technology that is driving the proliferation of military UAVs is migrating to other applications such as commercial deliveries.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>From Hellfire to Amazon</strong></span></h3>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the US military had deployed its first practical UAV, serving surveillance roles in Bosnia. By the second Iraq war, American UAVs were equipped with Hellfire missiles. In the last few years companies like Amazon have begun experimenting with using UAVs for delivering goods to consumers. Just as World War II aviation advances led to widespread commercial air travel, military UAV concepts are being adapted to less lethal applications.</p>
<p>One such non-military deployment of UAVs becoming widespread is in inspection and monitoring. UAVs can be employed in scenarios like railroad inspection to perform visual survey tasks like track inspection. Conceivably, these kinds of tasks will eventually also be fully automated.</p>
<p>Going forward though, will the direction of innovation remain the same? Will defense spending and innovations continue to trickle down to consumer products, or will the more consumer-oriented data revolution ignited in Silicon Valley bring new technology to the military? The so-called Internet of Things is defined by an explosion of sensors and sensor data in a wide range of industries, and private profit motivation may soon overtake defense spending as the source for innovations in areas like aviation electronics.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The Next Generation of Cable Assemblies</strong></span></h3>
<p>While the last 50 years have seen numerous innovations in cabling and interconnect technology for aviation, it doesnât really compare to the half century before 1969. That period saw the shift from hand-crank airplane engine starters to landing a man on the moon. The reason for this is that the utility of each individual sensor, connector, and cable assembly has been limited by the human element. Even the incredible technology enabling military UAVs to keep soldiers out of harmâs way and strike targets precisely still requires a great deal of human involvement. Over the next 50 years, automation is the force that will massively increase demand for connector and cable components and spur a half century of real revolution.</p>

 <a href="https://secure.campaigner.com/CSB/Public/Form.aspx?fid=1153473"><img class="alignnone wp-image-14527 size-full" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/Subscribe-g80.gif" alt="Subscribe-g80" width="80" height="20" /></a></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16941" src="http://www.connectorsupplier.com/wp-content/uploads/TE-Molex-second-source-connectors.gif" alt="TE and Molex second source connectors" width="550" height="342" /></p>
<p>The complexity of high-end electronics creates many opportunities for hardware and/or software problems, while pricing and time to market pressures create problems for those tasked with setting up the supply chain. For the connector world, the merger of these trends often means that second sources need to be ready to step in with complex parts that can be shipped without delay.</p>
<p>Molex and TE Connectivity have teamed up for a dual source alliance (DSA) agreement where each company will produce a new generation of high-speed input/output (I/O) and backplane connectors, and cable assemblies for data communications applications. Those products are designed for environments such as cloud computing equipment, switches, servers, and high performance storage.</p>
<p>The DSA is intended to build on the duoâs earlier sourcing agreements for products such as: zSFP+ interconnects, zQSFP+ interconnects, CDFP interconnects, microQSFP interconnects, and Nano-Pitch I/O interconnects. The partners will collaborate on the launch and promotion of select new connector and cable assembly products that enable the growing number of high-speed applications. These connectors will provide speeds up to 56 Gbps and beyond.</p>
<p>âThings that were problems at 10 Gbps are different than the issue with products that run at 25 Gbps today, and those problems will be different in next-generation 50 Gbps connectors. How product lines are ramped up will also change,â said Nathan Tracy, Technologist, system architecture team and manager of industry standards at TE Connectivity Data Communications.</p>
<p>He noted that customers were clear that they wanted second sources for high speed connectors. Molex and TE will each work to develop the design features that customers want, and they will share information and cross test products to ensure that the components meet userâs performance requirements.</p>
<p>âThis agreement lets us accelerate things,â said Scott Sommers, group product manager for I/O products and standards at Molex. âWe have the ability to collaborate during the design phase when it wise to do so. Working together lets us accelerate testing, and both companies can tool up at the same time.â</p>
<p>Though the companies will work together in some areas, they will compete in the marketplace. Both spokesmen noted that while many parameters will be identical, the end products and their pricing will be finalized independently.</p>
<p>Data centers are a primary target for the products. Equipment in these centers is rapidly evolving to deliver higher density, higher speeds and richer virtualization models. High-performance, high-speed connectors and cable assemblies must support the system data requirements of new data storage, servers, switches, routers and other applications.</p>
<p>Connectivity products need to offer high-speed electrical performance, which in turn requires sophisticated connector and cable assembly designs with advanced features for high-speed signaling, EMI containment and thermal efficiencies.</p>
<p>The Molex and TE alliance aims to produce connectors and cable assemblies that meet current and future requirements. The agreement is intended to offer increased product availability to customers and reduce the risk of new technology adoption by providing customers with a choice of independent suppliers with interoperable products.</p>
