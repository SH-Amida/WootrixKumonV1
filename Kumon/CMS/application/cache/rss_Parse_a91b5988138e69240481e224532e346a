			<title>'Black death' offers clues to battling HIV, hepatitis C centuries later</title>

			<description>The Black Death swept Europe in the 14th century eliminating up to half of the population but it left genetic clues that now may aid a researcher in treating HIV patients co-infected with hepatitis C using an anti-retroviral drug therapy. A new study will look at the blood samples of nearly 3,000 patients, primarily individuals with hemophilia, who were exposed to HIV during the early 1980s and late 1990s, to see if an inherited genetic variant that protects against HIV might also help prevent injury from Hepatitis C and other liver diseases. <!-- more --></description>

The virus selectively infects cells that form the brain's cortex, or outer layer, making them more likely to die and less likely to divide normally and make new brain cells. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>For more than a decade, a rare but potentially deadly fungus called Cryptococcus deuterogatti has taken up residence in the Pacific Northwest and Vancouver Island. Researchers found that the pathogen shed over a dozen different genes as it evolved into a new, more virulent species. Surprisingly, most of these discarded genes play a part in RNA interference or RNAi, a process that preserves the integrity of the genome in fungi and other organisms. <!-- more --></description>

Today, we know that inheritance is far more complex than what Mendel saw in his pea plants. Now scientists who track progress in genetics research share some of the things researchers have learned about how traits are passed from one generation to the next. <!-- more --></description>
