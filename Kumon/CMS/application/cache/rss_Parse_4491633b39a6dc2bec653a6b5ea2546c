The performance of the facility has been significantly increased due to the implementation of a Demag warehouse management system together with the installation a up-to-date Demag process crane that has a load capacity of 9 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz Dowy, Vice President Sales and Product Management at Terex Material Handling, explains: âWe modernised the store operated in Lixhe by CBR with a strong solution which is based on rugged crane systems and smart control modules. The result will ensure a continuous material flow thanks to consistently high handling rates.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lixhe: Beneluxâ largest Cement Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lixhe plant is one of the oldest locations operated by the cement manufacturer CBR, a subsidiary of the HeidelbergÂ­Cement Group. With an annual capacity of some 1,4 million tonnes of clinker and 1,5 million tonnes of cement, the plant in south-east Belgium is the largest cement works in the Benelux countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HeidelbergCement decided to invest in the raw material storage of the Lixhe plant in order to stay competitive. They addressed three clear goals with the automation of the raw material store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased productivity,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sustainable improvement in process reliability,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher level of occupational health and safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet these requirements, a fully automated crane was installed and a warehouse management system was implemented in the existing store. For the supply of the materials handling equipment as well as for the software control system, the cement manufacturer decided in favour of a complete Demag system, which was used to thoroughly modernise the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the calcareous sand which is quarried locally, three different grades of coal as well as ferric oxide are kept in the raw material store at the plant. The storage area measures 86 x 24 mÂ² in size and has five compartments that are divided into eight storage zones.&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the store is served by a bridge crane, the owner benefits from full utilisation of the available space, as the crane can reach virtually any point in the store. Beforehand, the work of distributing and collecting the raw materials was performed by a manually operated 9 t overhead travelling crane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertouil Hugues, who is responsible for maintenance at the Lixhe plant, explains: âThe old crane installation had to be replaced because the electric equipment no longer met current standards and the structural design of the crane had to be revised. The crane also needed to be used in continuous 24/7 operation. This was no longer economically feasible with a manually controlled crane.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rugged Crane Systems for continuous 24/7 Operation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An automated Demag double-girder over- head travelling crane that is equipped with a 3.2 mÂ³ powered clamshell grab is now used for handling the raw materials. Like its predecessor, the process crane has a span of 24 m and a load capacity of 9 t. Rugged and reliable crane components provide for continuous operation in the harsh environment. Efficient operation of the crane is also supported by high speeds (long-travel motions at 100 m/min asÂ  well as load-dependent lifting motions up to 90 m/min) and integrated load-swayÂ  damping. The crane installation is primarily used for clearing the tipping pit and for filling the chutes with the required blend of materials, which is ensured by crane weighing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Measurement of Fill Levels by Scanners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blend and order in which the material is added is precisely defined by the Demag warehouse management system, which controls the feed schedule to the kilns and facilitates transparent inventory management. Scanner systems were installed on the crane installation to measure the height of the aggregates. The scanners fitted below the crane bridge continuously track the height contours of the stored bulk material each time the crane travels over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software in the crane control centre uses the information to determine a constantly updated height profile and visualises the fill levels in all storage areas, including the minimum and maximum values. In addition, the control centre shows the current status of the crane with all relevant status messages. Customer-specific storage strategies can be added via the user-friendly interface at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Some six months after the installation entered service, Bertouil Hugues made an initial assessment: âThe automation of the processes has enabled us to boost the efficiency of our raw material store. Besides the higher handling rates provided by the crane system, its continuous operation without the need for any breaks has also contributed to the result. In addition, we have considerably enhanced the stability of our processes and further improved the safety of the working environment for our employees.â&lt;/p&gt;

Whether in Central Europe or in Asia the same problems are met: Well-planned delivery routes and carefully calculated stock levels are vital to achieve maximum cost optimisation during material delivery. These optimisations are often jeopardized by the reality of day-to-day business. Bakeries, the customers of the mills, place their orders too late, forcing the mills to supply material immediately to avoid production stops. What are the reasons for these âfire-fightingâ situations and how can they be avoided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lack of Storage Management in Bakeries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even bakeries with multiple storage silos often do not have an automated level monitoring system to control their inventory levels. Therefore their stocks have to be checked manually on a regular basis and an order has to be triggered to the flour supplier on time. Due to unforeseen fluctuations in demand or simply by not having verified the stock levels sudden emergencies arise that lead to unplanned extra tours for the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing sensors for level monitoring in the silos of the bakeries would bring a partial improvement. Unfortunately, the willingness to invest is often lacking because âitâs working as it isâ and it doesnât matter that it is a very costly and inefficient way to do it. An ideal solution would be that the mills take responsibility of the level monitoring centrally for their customers and offer this as a special service thus optimising their own material and delivery disposition and at the same time reducing the administrative effort involved. Of course the cost question arises immediately - who is going to pay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, closer analysis shows that the millâs investment would amortize itself in a relatively short time due to cost savings from the optimized supply chain process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Centralized Level Measurement at Mills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on UWTs long-term experience the company developed a remote controlled level-measurement system for flour mills: On each silo of the bakery the maintenance-free plumb bob system Nivobob 4000 is fitted for level monitoring. For easy mounting, just a standard 1.5 in threaded socket in the silo roof is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bakeries the level signals are bundled by UWTs Nivotec software combined with a Wago Webcontroller. The information received is passed to the web via Ethernet connection and a routed IP address. The mill can securely access this information (password-protected) via any Web- browser at any time of the day. It is possible to include further customers in the visualization system without additional hardware or costs for the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the priority is to keep installation at the bakeries to a minimum a GSM modem can be used to remotely access the data. In this case only a sim-card is needed in the Wago to pass the modem which collects all level signals and sends them in an encrypted log via mobile phone over the Web to the appropriate controller in the mill. As only small amounts of data are being sent a low priced sim contract is sufficient for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current silo levels can be displayed at the mill control centre using the NiÂ­Â­votec visualization software. The dispatÂ­cher can check the real-time status of the silos because the visualization controller is directly integrated into the Ethernet system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;System Advantages and Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the whole system is the simplification of the material disposition processes leading to a reduction of costs for all parties involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The installation of the system in the bakery as well as in the mill can usually be carried out by the mills own service engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control cabinets only have to be set-up once; later on no additional IT support is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All silo levels can be controlled at the same time for stock material safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system can be dismantled at one customer and installed again at another without extra costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mill is able to hold the correct material in stock according to the customerâs requirements and can optimise the logistical routes and schedules. The availability of the required information can reduce the need for express deliveries or empty runs dramatically. On the customer side, at the bakery, the task of manually checking the material level within the storage silos is eliminated and production bottlenecks due to a lack of material are history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material flow now follows a standard process with much greater planning security: Last but not least it naturally leads to a more harmonious working relationship and increased satisfaction on both sides which ultimately mean a stronger partnership between customer and supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

I say âinterestingâ because they are only moderately accurate, costly, require a lot of tuning after installation and are usually only as good as the whole process around them. That being said, one of the reasons the technology exists is because there isn&#039;t anything else that can do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like my dad used to say when I would show up with a rubber mallet when he asked for a hammer, âYou need the right tool for the right job.â And flowmeters are exactly the right instrument for measuring the flow rate of many solid materials. This simple fact has led to the development of several different versions of solids flowmeter. In this article we will discuss and evaluate these, so that you too will have the right tool for your industrial flow application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of technologies used for metering the flow of solids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact Flowmeter â the most popular form of solids flowmeter, impact meters, as they are often called, guide the material through an infeed pipe or chute and create a specific trajectory for the material to strike a flat sensing plate. The amount of force the impact creates is measured by means of load cells or an LVDT (linear variable differential transformer). As the plate is deflected by the force of the material, the load cell or LVDT deflects and generates a signal, which is converted into a flow rate by an integrator (Fig. 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centripetal Flowmeter â this is a variation on the impact design. A centripetal solids flowmeter guides the material through a curved sensing plate, which is connected to one or more load cells. The material must be guided in parallel to the sensing plate as it enters the curve, and the tangential force exerted on the load cell(s) is transmitted to the integrator and then converted into a flow rate (Fig. 2).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coriolis Flowmeter â the solids coriolis flowmeter does not use the same principle as a liquid coriolis meter. In a solids application, material enters the flowmeter and is directed onto rotating vanes driven by a motor. The motor is connected to a torque arm, which is mounted to a load cell. As the amount of material fed into the coriolis meter increases, the torque on the motor increases. The load cell detects this increase and sends a signal to an integrator, which translates it into a flow rate (Fig. 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave Flowmeter â one of the lesser-used technologies, microwave or radar flowmeters, emits a 24 or 125 GHz microwave into the material flow in a pipe or chute. Based on the Doppler principle, the change in microwaves reflected back to the sensor is measured and transmitted as a 4 to 20 mA signal for scaling in a PLC system to become a flow rate. Microwave-based products can be used in pneumatically-fed systems, as the extra force of the material flow does not affect the measurement as is the case with the three technologies discussed above (Fig. 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacitive Flowmeter â solids flow sensors using capacitance are based on two independent measurements. One is the change in capacitance from an empty pipe to a full pipe, which is proportional to the concentration of the material. The other is a velocity measurement, which uses two sensors to indicate the time it takes for the material to move from the first sensor to the second. The signals from these measurements are then fed into an integrator, which outputs a flow rate. Capacitive measurement can also be used with pneumatic systems (Fig. 5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, each technology has its own advantages and disadvantages. Fig. 6 shows some of the more critical aspects to consider when trying to identify the best product fit for your particular application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impact Flowmeters: two distinct Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they can handle very low to very high flow rates. Second, material buildup on the sensing plate does not affect their accuracy or repeatability, as only the horizontal force of impact causes a deflection on the sensor. Any additional weight, for example if some material sticks, does not shift the output of the system.&lt;br /&gt;
	The oldest of all of these technologies, impact meters have been in use for over 60 years. Impact solids flowmeters can be very compact â some are only 650 millimeters high, while others are suited for aerated gravity conveyor input and are 2500 millimeters tall. As the size of the unit increases, so does the cost. However, the enclosures are designed to be dust-tight and are very easy to clean and calibrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Centripetal Flowmeters: higher Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centripetal solids flowmeters take the accuracy prize. However, caution must be taken when applying this type of product. With the right material characteristics and flow, centripetal solutions can be extremely accurate. However, if the material is at all sticky â and begins to build up on the sensing plate â a centripetal flowmeterâs signal will begin to shift as the tangential force is measured. Flow rates are also limited with centripetal designs, but this technology also offers dust-tight enclosures and easy calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coriolis Flowmeters: high Flow/Accuracy, higher Power Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coriolis solids flowmeters are a nice alternative for applications involving high flow rates and demanding high precision. Higher flow rates and precision seem to be the norm as process instrumentation evolves. The coriolis design is also tried and tested but it has some disadvantages. Abrasive materials can prematurely wear out the blades of the meter, which means that they must be replaced. Large particle sizes can be a problem as they can jam or clog the discharge. The other disadvantage of a coriolis meter is that the unit is driven by a low-voltage motor. With all the other styles, typical instrumentation power supply (generally 230 VAC or less) is required for the device, whereas AC motors will need anywhere from 120 to 600 VAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microwave Flowmeters: low Cost but lower Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave flowmeters are beginning to gain some ground as a low cost, low accuracy alternative to the large bulky units already discussed. A product that fits in your hand and that can be installed in less than an hour versus having to crane in a unit taller than you has its advantages. Calibration is quick and simple, and with no moving or rotating mechanical parts to worry about, it becomes very appealing. However, any process where accuracy is required will not benefit from this type of product. Microwave units can also be used in systems involving gravity-fed solids, dense phase or dilute phase pneumatic conveyors. The microwave solids flowmeters generally look similar to a microwave level sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capacitive Flowmeters: simple Installation, lower Accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive flowmeters have also been on the market for some time. The use of two measuring principles helps increase the accuracy of the total flow measurement, but the device cannot handle higher volumes of material. Installation is simple and straightforward, as it simply involves removing a section of pipe and installing the flowmeter. Calibration is also easy, but the accuracy is not as good as the large mechanical units. Capacitive units can be used with gravity-fed or dense phase pneumatic systems and are also a very price-competitive solution compared to the large mechanical devices. The capacitive solids flowmeter is the most similar to a liquid-based meter, as it looks almost exactly like an electromagnetic meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Choices, Choices: how to decide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right product will come down to the age-old triple constraint: price, accuracy and fit. If you can afford to spend the money, you don&#039;t have to sacrifice what you need for what you can afford.&lt;br /&gt;
	Accuracy is based on what is demanded from your process. Fit comes down to how the product will perform with the variables of material density, flow rate, temperature, moisture content, particle size, installation space, pre-feed device, material compatibility. And it&#039;s important not to forget about approvals for hazardous zones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To be an Expert, or not to be an Expert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with flowmeters for eight years and I consider myself to be well versed. I have colleagues who have been working with this technology for 35 years and they consider themselves to be experienced. However, I have yet to meet anyone who considers himself or herself a flowmeter expert!&lt;br /&gt;
	There are just so many variables to consider, many of which can change over seasons or even with the daily change in weather. Unfortunately, there are no quick and easy answers. Understanding the application in great detail is a necessity when it comes to applying the right product and options.&lt;br /&gt;
	My recommendation is to talk to your local supplier and provide him or her with as much information as possible. At Siemens, we provide you with an application questionnaire that asks you to enter all of the required data. We then generate a proposal for the application and also highlight anything that we may wish to investigate further. Our goal is to always ensure the best performance of our products in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sometimes You just need a Hammer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, solids flowmeters may not be the worldâs most amazing piece of technology. However, they are an essential part of many industrial flow applications for the simple reason that nothing else can do their job. Sure, for your day-to-day home repairs, you could purchase a top-of-the-line nail gun with laser accuracy and power enough to shoot nails hundreds of meters per second. Realistically, though, sometimes you just need a hammer. Similarly, sometimes you just need a solids flowmeter â the right tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;

Gearless drives, like those implemented for mine hoists in underground mining operations, allow the use of larger drive units and are increasingly being utilized to drive belt conveyors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual belt conveyors in hard rock mining operations all over the world nowadays extend over distances of more than 16 km and overcome height differences of up to 500 m, while normally achieving outputs of approx. 12000 t/h.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such belt conveyors have had a significant impact on the development of individual components. Conveyor belts with strength of up to 7800 N/mm are actually in use today. In South American copper mines such belts are driven by electromechanical drives, consisting of electrical motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage motor) and helical bevel gears with a capacity of up to 3150 kW each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance requirements of belt conveyors are redefined by lower ore contents and deeper deposits. Nowadays conveyors are routed through tunnel systems such that the maximum length available is required in order to reduce the number of underground transfer stations. This places higher demands on the quality and strength of the conveyor belts. Today, the St 10.000 with strength of 10000 N per Millimeter of belt width is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative for continuously improving belt quality with ever-increasing drives located at both ends of the conveyor is to optimize the application of drive forces on the belt. Possible alternatives include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belt on belt drives (TT-drives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate drives in the top strand and/or bottom strand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorized carrying rollers [1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it is not always possible to implement such advanced drive concepts. For driven carrying rollers, for example, there is still no cost-effective and reliable solution. Thatâs why the current development projects focus on adapting conveyors with the traditional head and/or tail pulley drive systems to new challenges and demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takraf is currently involved in studies that focus on a belt conveyor system that utilizes St 10000 belts. The limits of conventional drives with helical bevel gears are exceeded with the required drive capacity of 21000 kW per individual conveyor. Low-speed synchronous motors, like those frequently implemented as drive solution for mine hoists in underground mines, permit larger drive capacities. As part of the above-mentioned study, a conveyor is equipped with three gearless drives of 7000 kW each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gearless Drives â Maintenance and Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of gearless drives compared to electromechanical drives cannot be reduced to the possibility of installing larger drive units alone. The curve of the motorâs efficiency in relation to the motorâs torque shows over the entire spectrum values that are higher than the characteristics of traditional conveyor drives with asynchronous wound rotor or squirrel cage motors completed with gears (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, belt conveyors do not always work at full load over the entire period of operation. Partial load conditions and even (short-term) idle periods are all part of a belt conveyorâs operating re-gime. In contrast to asynchronous mo-tors, the efficiency of synchronous motors increases in the range of partial load (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher efficiency of synchronous motors in general and especially in the partial load range and the fact that mechanical loads are eliminated during transfer of torque lead to lower operating costs for the conveyor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of the gear unit including oil change intervals can be omitted just like the maintenance of the high-speed coupling. This is of particular interest wherever maintenance processes involve considerable effort. Prime examples of this would be operating conveyors in Canada at ambient temperatures of -45Â°C or conveyor systems set up at an altitude of 4500 m and more above sea level, such as in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Structure of Gearless Conveyor Drives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synchronous motor consists of a rotor that is connected with the drive pulley shaft and a stator that rests on a foundation or a corresponding steel structure (Fig. 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to conventional belt conveyor drives, the drive unit with gear box and asynchronous motor is replaced with a synchronous motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following conditions must be taken into consideration if gearless drive systems are used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deflection of the drive pulley shaft at the shaft end due to varying belt tensions at the different load and operating conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible settling of the stator foundations or deformation of the steel structure used to support the stator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibility for readjusting the entire drive in case of belt misalignment during commissioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prerequisite is the need to comply with the permissible deviations in the motorâs air gap. Since the design of the motor, motor mount, drive pulley and the associated steel structure are closely tied together, Takraf entered into a cooperation agreement with ABB. This agreement allows to select a joint motor concept already during component planning, considering client specifications as well as site conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following systems are worth considering as a motor concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bearingless motor: The rotor is directly connected to the drive pulley shaft (by means of a flange connection), whereas the stator of the drive motor is supported separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motor plus separate bearing: The rotor has two bearings. The stator is secured to the foundation or steel structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flexible coupling facilitates the transfer of torque between rotor and drive pulley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diaphragm coupling: Compared to the motor with separate bearings, the motor mount on the output shaft side and the flexible coupling is replaced by a diaphragm coupling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bearingless Motor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotor is rigidly connected to the drive pulley by means of a flange connection (Figs. 4 and 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the standard layout, an additional criterion is necessary for dimensioning the drive pulley. The deflection of the pulley shaft at the coupling flange may not exceed the close tolerances that result from the permissible deviations in the air gap between rotor and stator. That leads to drive pulley structures with large shaft diameters (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the rigidness of the stator mount determines the tolerances in the motors air gap to the same extent, it is necessary to offer solutions with very limited deformations that also allow a subsequent alignment of the stator during commissioning of the conveyor. Drive realignment would be necessary if a proper belt alignment could be reached by drive pulley readjustment only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Motor with extra Bearing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the solution previously described, no motor bearings are needed, neither is a special coupling required for connecting the motor to the drive pulley. A rigid flange connection is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, bearingless motors also have disadvantages, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special drive pulley design to decrease shaft deflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The motor must be assembled on site, since the rotor first has to be connected with the pulley shaft and the stator is then moved over the rotor. This means that the motor must be disassembled again after factory assembly and completion of test run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case of damage, the motor cannot be disconnected quickly and/or replaced with a spare drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the load case earthquakes, it is necessary to take into consideration the large (rotor) masses at the cantilevered drive shaft end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages described here with regard to bearingless motors have led to working with ABB to design a motor with separate bearings as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Diaphragm Coupling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the bearing motor previously described, the motor and drive pulley are connected by means of a flexible coupling (Fig. 6). A gear coupling was selected as suitable transfer element for the torque being transferred and the permissible angular deviation of both shafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For very large motors (6000 kW up to 8000 kW of drive power), geared couplings reach their limits. The drive concept with bearingless motors has resulted in heavy and expensive drive pulleys due to the deflection of the pulley shaft in the area of very large drives.&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on these disadvantages, a motor concept with a bearing at motor N-end and a diaphragm coupling to connect the rotor with the drive pulley was developed. The diaphragm coupling combines the functions of the bearing at the motor D-End and the geared coupling between rotor and pulley (Fig. 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To transport the motor, a support structure will be placed on the motor frame, which secures the rotor shaft on the side with the output shaft end. This also provides the option to quickly separate the motor and the drive pulley by opening the coupling in case of an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Takraf was awarded a contract by the Chilean mine operator Codelco to deliver conveyors with 12 gearless belt drives for the worldâs largest underground copper mine (El Teniente). After completion of the conveyor installation, approx. 12000 t/h of copper ore will be transported over a total distance of 11.5 km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive motors each have an output of 2500 kW. As a result of extensive dis-cussions with the customer, the principle of the motor with separate bearings was implemented for this contract. The commissioning of the first motor is slated for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearless drives are expanding the service range of drives of belt conveyors. Individual drives with a driving power of up to 8000 kW are possible. Studies on the use of gearless drives of this performance class are currently being carried out in the current projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to maintenance and energy efficiency, gearless drives offer advantages compared to the conventional electromechanical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive motor can be designed as bearingless, with bearings or with diaphragm coupling. Motor size, site conditions and customer requirements form the basis for the solution that is to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

These conveyors are supported by unusual lightweight triangular galleries spanning 36 m each and weighing only 209 kg/m. The triangular galleries do not include walkways and are maintained with a motorized trolley. This article discusses the design and construction of this unusual conveyor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in the Gulf of Khambhat in the Bharuch district of Gujarat on the west coast of India, the Adani Group&#039;s new solid cargo handling port at the city of Dahej includes two fully mechanised deep draft berths for excavating coal from cape class vessels at a rate of 4600 t/h. Excavated coal is transported by conveyor to two stockpiles holding 125000 t apiece. Two 2500 t/h reclaimers discharge coal from these stockpiles onto Yard Conveyor J10C1. The discharge chute at the head end of J10C1 includes a diverter gate that allows operators to either direct coal to a truck loading conveyor, or direct coal to the âSilo Conveyorâ System that moves up to 6000 t/h to a rail loading silo approx. 4.75 km from the port. From the silo, coal is transported by a private Adani rail network to an Indian Railways station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) was initially awarded a contract by PMC Projects (a subsidiary of the Adani Group) to produce a basic engineering design of the elevated Silo Conveyors, and a basic engineering design for the Adani Power Conveyor system PMC intends to build in the future to transport coal from the terminus of the second silo conveyor to a new power plant they will build 10.85 km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After CDI completed the basic engineering, PMC realized that acquiring the land in the conveyor corridor posed a significant challenge. To avoid large change orders, the Adani group decided to handle all procurement, construction, and project management in-house. CDI was awarded a new contract to supply PMC with detail engineering design drawings of the silo conveyors and their supporting structures as well as a control philosophy. CDI also provided consulting services during fabrication, and support services during commissioning of the silo conveyors. The transfer house detail drawings were supplied by Elecon Engineering Co. Ltd (Elecon). All electrical and instrumentation work including PLC logic development and programming was completed by Larsen and Toubro (L&amp;amp;T). Project management was handled directly by PMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;System Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silo Conveyor system is comprised of three conveyors connected in series that transport up to 6000 t/h of coal from the Dahej port to a rail wagon loading silo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first conveyor in the series is SC-1A (Silo Conveyor 1A). SC-1A is 1.6 km long and gains 6.7 m of elevation. It transports up to 6000 t/h on an ST1000 1600 mm wide belt traveling 7.5 m/s. Two horizontal curves with 1100 m radii and nine vertical curves with various radii are included in the conveyor route. Most of the conveyor is located in an elevated gallery that is 6 m above the ground except where the conveyor crosses roads. Here the gallery elevation rises to 9 m above the road grade. SC-1A is powered by two 500 kW invertor driven motors, and includes two brakes. One brake is located on the tail pulley, and the other is located within the take-up sheave assembly. This second brake is used to boost the take-up tension during an unpowered stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SC-1A discharges onto the second conveyor in the series tagged SC-2A. SC-2A is 1.4 km long and gain 8.7 m of elevation. It transports up to 6000 t/h on an ST1000 1600 mm wide belt traveling 7.5 m/s. Like SC-1A the entire conveyor is elevated at least 6m off the ground. It is powered by two 500 kW invertor driven motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, SC-2A directs feed onto a 485 m long low speed conveyor tagged SC-3. However, SC-2Aâs discharge chute includes a diverter gate that will allow SC-2A to discharge coal onto the Adani Power Conveyor system in the future. SC-3 discharges coal into the rail wagon loading silo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Route Optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route selected for the silo conveyors was tightly constrained by a number of existing industries occupying most of the land outside the port, by Lakhigam village, and by a large road. The conveyors could not pass outside a 5 m wide corridor between the road and surrounding developed properties. CDI was able to eliminate two transfer houses that were in the original feasibility study using tight 1100 m radius horizontal curves. However, we could not design a conventional conveyor with a curve tight enough to avoid a transfer station outside Lakhigam village. The final route is shown in Fig. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering horizontal curves like the two in this system is an iterative process. First, a rough profile of the conveyor is selected. The tensions along the conveyor route are computed and used to determine the minimum horizontal curve radius that the conveyor can safely negotiate. The tension prediction must be accurate and requires drag prediction using rubber rheological equations [1] and dynamic analysis [2]. After determining the belt tensions, a new route is selected with horizontal curves and tensions for the new route are computed. The process is then repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unusual Features of SC-1A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SC-1A is designed with a number of unusual features including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Speed: Only one other conveying system in India runs as fast as Dahej-- the Mundra Port overland system, a collaborative design effort between CDI and Elecon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightweight: The triangular galleries that support SC-1A weigh only 209 kg/m and span 36 m apiece. This is half the weight and 50% more span than the typical box style conveyor gallery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorised Maintenance Trolley: To save weight, the triangular gallery does not include walkways. Workers maintain the system using a motorised trolley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal Curves: the 1100 m radius horizontal curves are among the tightest radius horizontal curves in the world for 1600 m wide conventional steel cord troughed conveyors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Dust: an integrated low profile stringer-hood completely encloses the coal removing the need for side cladding on the gallery to prevent the release of dust into the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Rolling Resistance Belt: The bottom cover of the Dahej conveyor uses a low rolling resistance rubber compound that provide substantial power savings over the lifetime of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low TIR idlers: All idlers installed on this system had a TIR of less than 0.4 mm. This reduced the friction and noise generated by the conveyor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High Speed Conveying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating SC-1A and SC-2A at 7.5 m/s reduced the capital expense of the system and reduced the belt tension in SC-1A allowing the conveyor to bend through tighter horizontal curves. However, operating these conveyors at high speeds reduces the life of their belts compared to identical belts running slower. This is because most belt wear occurs in the loading zone and, all else being equal, a high speed belt sees the loading zone more often than a low speed belt. Since SC-3 is much shorter than SC-1A and SC-2A we designed it to operate at 4 m/s to reduce the frequency of belt replacement on this conveyor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the speed of SC-3 is 4 m/s instead of 7.5 m/s, the belt width of SC-3 is 2200 mm â far wider than the 1600 mm wide belts installed on SC-1A and SC-2A. In addition to the increased width, the weight of the SC-3 belt is 59 kg/m, almost 50% more than the weight of the SC-1A and SC-2A belts which weigh 42 kg/m. On SC-3 the linear weight of material on the belt is 476 kg/m whereas on SC-1A and SC-2A the increased speed reduced the linear weight of material on these belts to 264 kg/m. Reduced linear weight reduces the belt tension necessary to control sag, reduces the indentation losses, and reduces the tension required to lift the material. This reduces overall belt tension which improves belt tracking in the horizontal curves. The narrower belt also shortened the idler roll length from 816 to 594 mm reducing the weight and cost of the idlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrow belt reduced the width of the elevated gallery, cutting the weight, strength and space requirements for the gallery. These reductions reduce the capital investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tolerances allowed for high speed conveyor components are substantially tighter than their equivalent low speed counterparts. In particular, to reduce vibration and noise and extend idler life, CDI recommends that idler TIR not exceed 0.4 mm at 7.5 m/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a handful of companies in the world can consistently manufacture idlers with 0. mm TIR. The typical welded end disk idler assembly usually fails to meet spec because the welding process warps the shell. Several leading edge manufacturers have approached the problem by designing press fit end disks. This is the approach Elecon chose when they designed a special idler roll just for Dahej (Fig. 3). The result was an idler with consist low TIR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tubular Triangular Gallery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tubular triangular elevated conveyor gallery used at Dahej was not a new concept [3]. In his 2001 paper Stapples estimated that the tubular conveyor gallery is about 40% cheaper than the widely used box gallery style conveyor and recommended that all elevated overland conveyors adopt this design. However, the design of such galleries is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to working on the Dahej system, CDI designed two triangular gallery supported conveyors in Nigeria. CDI and Exclusive Technical Service (now part of Sandvik) collaborated on their first triangular gallery conveyor for the Dangote Cement plant in Nigeria [4]. Later, in 2009, CDI worked with Zigong Industrial Machinery in China to design and install a second triangular gallery conveyor at Dangote parallel to the first conveyor. In both of these cases CDI provided only GA drawings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Dahej, CDI was responsible for all detail design drawings of the conveyor gallery. This was the first time CDI created complete detail drawing of the triangular galleries. It was also PMCâs first time constructing triangular galleries. Our engineering teams needed to work closely to create a practical design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting the tight structural tolerances specified by CDI to minimize vibration on the high speed conveyor proved a significant challenge for PMC particularly in horizontal galleries. Precise alignment was further complicated by the introduction of camber. Each 36 m gallery was constructed from three 12 m modules. Precisely fabricated wedges were butt welded between these modules to create a single 36 m long cambered gallery. Ultimately PMC designed a jig system to control the conveyor alignment to within the straight and horizontally curved galleries. The jig controlled the belt centerline to within +/- 1 mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMC fabricated all galleries and bents in a laydown yard at the port (Fig. 4). The gallery design could not accommodate training idlers and PMC engineers recognized that field adjustment of the idlers during commissioning would be difficult. To avoid belt training issues, the locations of the idlers were controlled to within 1 mm. In the horizontal curves a custom idler jig was used to position the idlers (Fig. 5). The work paid off as no idler adjustments were required during commissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conveyor Maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkways substantially increase the weight of conveyor galleries. To eliminate this additional weight, CDI designed and provided detail drawings for a triangular maintenance trolley that allows maintenance personnel access to the conveyor (Fig. 6). In the past CDI had provided only GA drawings of the trolley. The Dahej trolley was the first trolley for which CDI created a complete set of electrical and mechanical drawings. These drawings were given to Elecon so that they could manufacturer the trolleys on their plant in Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dust Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal dust generation was a major concern at Dahej, particularly where the conveyor passes through Lakhigam Village. Instead of enclosing the entire gallery with cladding, the belt trough-stringer-hoodcover were designed to form a single aerodynamic section that shields the coal from wind (Fig. 7). The design was validated using computational flow dynamics (Fig. 8). Installing side cladding on the gallery would have made idler inspection from the trolley very difficult. The low profile hood cover prevents personnel from viewing the top side of the belt. Alignment of the conveyor can be visualized from the underside of the belt. Heat detection systems are critical as it is not possible to see a fire on the belt outside of the transfer towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further reduce dust, a Dry Fog Dust Suppression (DFDS) system was installed at each conveyor discharge point to control dust generated in the chutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;System Erection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the conveyor system passes through both residential and industrial areas, minimizing the inconvenience and disruptions to the local community was an important consideration. PMC created a strategic plan for each and every gallery, mapping the approach through the village to ensure fast safe erection of the galleries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the land issues were resolved construction proceeded rapidly. As land was acquired foundations for the conveyor support columns were poured. After completing the foundations, the bents and 36 m long galleries were moved out of the port on 24 m long trailers. In total, 86 triangular galleries travelled 2 to 4 km along the main village road, before reaching the conveyor where they were quickly installed using cranes. Final gallery positioning was completed with the assistance of a surveyor to maintain the +/1 mm conveyor centreline accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, acquiring land is challenging and conveyor systems often must allow local populations to freely pass through the conveyor corridor. Free movement is best facilitated by elevating the conveyor system, but this can become cost prohibitive. A triangular gallery with a motorised maintenance trolley is a practical structure for economically supporting elevated conveyors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the light weight structure, high speed conveying and horizontal curves offers further reduce capital investment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the engineering and construction challenges faced when constructing these conveyors. The authors hope the Dahej conveyor design can offer a benchmark for modern overland conveyor design&lt;/p&gt;

The company began manufacturing operations in 1943, with a capacity of just 60 000 t. Expanding gradually according to a clear strategic vision, the firm has developed innovative processes and technologies that contribute to dynamic growth, while fostering an environmentally-responsible, community-oriented culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most cement manufacturing sites, GCC Dakotah employs an extensive conveyor system to handle raw materials and move finished product. In keeping with its long-range plans to employ industry best practices for bulk handling and fugitive material control in its plants, company officials conducted an extensive assessment of the conveyors in early 2013. It was determined that significant upgrades could be made on conveyor transfer points to reduce spillage and dust emissions, and they contacted Martin Engineering for a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âVirtually any time bulk material is moved, especially in large quantities or at high speeds, the potential exists to create and release dust,â explained Martin Engineering Product Engineer Dan Marshall. âDust accumulation affects both safety and productivity, so itâs really more than just a housekeeping issue. Complicating the situation is the fact that bulk handling systems frequently must accommodate changing weather and material conditions, making dust management an even bigger challenge.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scope of Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade involved a significant overhaul of six transfer points on four conveyors, which were originally constructed in the late 1970s. All belts are 24 in (61 cm) wide, and range in length from 40 ft (12.2 m) to 110 ft (33.5 m). During normal operation, they move 200 to 250 t/h of clinker from the storage building and carry it to the bins feeding the finish mills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âMost of the material handling system at this plant was fairly standard issue for its time, but some of the components were nearing the end of their useful life,â commented GCC Maintenance Manager Ralph Denoski. âWe were also aware that significant advancements had been made in some areas of bulk handling, and we wanted to take advantage of the newest technologies.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a detailed proposal from Martin Engineering in hand, GCC planned the upgrade process for a scheduled shutdown in March. In addition to supplying the components, Martin Engineering was responsible for planning and supervision of the project, while a mechanical contracting group assisted with the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conveyor System Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work began on all four conveyors by disconnecting the material inlet chutes from the existing skirtboard system and removing the worn rubber skirt seals, clamps, supports, skirtboard chute walls and tail boxes. Existing idlers were also removed to allow mounting of new belt support systems and troughing roll assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each conveyor, three Martin Trac-Mount Idlers were installed, spaced to deliver optimum belt support. The unique idler design delivers proper belt carriage, while stabilising the belt line to improve sealing. Its slim profile requires only 8 in (203 mm) of space for 6 in (152 mm) idlers, and the slide-in / slide-out frames allow service without the need to raise the belt or remove adjacent idlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new idlers and troughing roll assemblies in place, each transfer point received one new impact cradle and two belt support cradles. Installed under the loading zone, Martin Impact Cradles absorb the force of falling material in a transfer point and stabilise the belt line to help prevent the escape of dust and fines. Rugged impact bars are composed of a top layer of low-friction, ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) polymer and a lower layer of energy-absorbing styrene butadiene rubber (SBR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in conjunction with the impact cradles are a pair of Martin Slider Cradles on each conveyor. Installed under the skirtboard of the transfer point, these cradles support the edges of the belt specifically to eliminate sagging. With the proper support in place, pinch points that can trap material and gouge the belts are eliminated, improving both sealing efficiency and belt life. When the top eventually wears out, the bars can simply be flipped over to provide a second wear surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen foot sections of skirt board were installed on each transfer point, with new side / center supports and covers. The new skirt board is 7 in (17.8 cm) high on two of the conveyors, and 12 in (30.5 cm) high on the other two. Each system also included internal skirt board wear liners and a new tail box assembly with sealing components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deliver positive containment of fugitive dust, each transfer point was outfitted with Martin Apronseal Skirting, a dual design with two sealing surfaces. A primary seal is clamped to the steel skirt board to keep lumps on the belt, and a secondary seal or âoutriggerâ strip captures any fines or dust particles that may pass beneath the primary seal. The secondary seal lies gently on the belt and self-adjusts to maintain consistent strip-to-belt pressure, despite high-speed material movement and fluctuations in the beltâs line of travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each conveyor was then fitted with a Martin Tracker for the return side, installed approximately 10 feet (3 meters) ahead of the tail pulley. By providing immediate and continuous precision adjustment of the belts, the Tracker helps reduce edge damage, prevent spillage and extend belt life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, each belt received one Martin QC1 Cleaner HD as a primary cleaner and one Martin SQC2S Cleaner. The QC #1 features a special polyurethane blend and tungsten carbide tip to deliver service life 2 to 3 times longer than conventional urethane blades (According to Martin Engineering). Designed to provide excellent cleaning performance immediately, avoiding any break-in period, the assembly maintains consistent tension without frequent adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire upgrade operation was completed in just 11 days during the scheduled outage, with crews working 12-hour days to accommodate the planned shutdown. While specific cost savings are difficult to quantify, Denoski said the difference is easily observed. âThe production team responsible for that area has had nothing but positive feedback about the upgrades,â he commented. âWeâre not losing product to spillage and dust, so that material can be sold instead of cleaned up off the floor. The manpower formerly spent on cleanup can now be directed to core business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âOur experience with Martin Engineering has been very positive,â Denoski concluded. âThe companyâs greatest strengths are its knowledge of bulk material handling problems and the best solutions for addressing them. And the no-excuses guarantee gives us the confidence of knowing that it will stand behind its products.â&lt;/p&gt;

Africa is an emerging continent, where the demand for cement is steadily increasing due to the continuously growing population and the need for infrastructure development. Dangote has been using Beumer systems such as loading systems, belt conveyors and bucket elevators for years. Systems from third-party suppliers are also used. âWhen it came to a belt misalignment on a bucket elevator used for feeding silos with a height of more than 60 m, we repeatedly had to endure production downtimesâ, explains Kornelius Thimm, head of Customer Support for Beumer in Beckum, Germany. This is a typical problem, according to Thimm. The system had to be stopped repeatedly for the workers to correct the error. In the long run, however, this needed to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cement manufacturer had made various service agreements with Beumer Customer Support. âOn principle, our agreements are specially designed to meet the individual requirements of the customerâ, explains Thimm. In order for them to be optimally tailored to meet the customer&#039;s needs, a Beumer service technician evaluated all of Dangote&#039;s on-site systems. The agreements can range from only maintenance and inspection to a long-term placement of service personnel on site. Beumer Belt Management, for example, helps to avoid downtime through regular inspections and timely replacement of bucket elevator belts. The Residential Service comprises technical support, preventive maintenance and inspection, emergency plans, system and process analyses and optimisation as well as spare parts and facility management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modernisation that Pays Off Quickly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beumer specialists work together with the customer to find a sustainable solution. âOur goal is to further improve trouble-free intralogistic processes in order to guarantee value-added material flowâ, explains Thimm. In this case, the modernisation of the plant was recommended. âWe didn&#039;t just want to repair the errors, but actively support the company to meet upcoming capacity and technology requirementsâ, says Thimm. After an in-depth consultation with Beumer specialists, the belt and the buckets were replaced with the latest heavy-duty technology developed from Beumer. This solution offers buckets that are mounted firmly to the back of the belt by segments and bolts. Belts with wire-free zones are used for the heavy-duty bucket elevators just as with all Beumer belt bucket elevators. The buckets can be fastened to the belt without damaging the steel wires or even cutting them. The traction forces of the bucket elevator belt are maintained to the full extent. The new bucket shape also allows for smoother running and therefore less noise generation. Furthermore, the return pulleys were replaced. âThe new conveyor belts are more resistant against mechanical wear, and they can transport coarse-grained material and high mass flows. All this makes the new heavy-duty bucket elevator the preferred product for this customerâ, explains Thimm. This solution helps the cement manufacturer to increase the availability of the bucket elevator, reduce energy consumption and extend service life and makes the company more competitive in the long term, as opposed to the replacement of only one belt. âIf we assume that the new Beumer solution lasts twice as long as the old belt, the modification would have paid off after a short period of timeâ, confirms Thimm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More than Just Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Beumer Group, Customer Support is more than just service. Customer Support is a separate department on its own, independent of conveying and loading technology, palletising and packaging technology and sortation and distribution systems. âIt&#039;s basically a company within the companyâ, explains Thimm. âWe have our own Sales department, which allows us to implement projects independently.â The goal is to support the customer for even better results. The head of Customer Support identifies a pronounced trend: There are still customers who invest in their own skilled maintenance personnel, but more and more companies want to delegate this responsibility. Beumer offers the customers an all-inclusive service - everything from one source. Beumer Group employees take on the responsibility for operating times, performance and economic efficiency of the systems and are trained regularly to stay up-to-date with the latest technology so the customer can concentrate on their core business. âOvertime, the number of technicians assigned to Dangote will increase to ensure machine availability as the increasing requirements will require a tremendous amount of time and work, impossible for one technician alone to accomplishâ, explains Thimm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the customer wishes to use their own maintenance personnel, Customer Support specialists can provide training to bring machine operator up-to-date and introduce new employees to the systems. This method ensures maximum operating time for the systems. Training is required for the initial installation, as well as a follow-up several months after the system has been running. At this time, the customer has the opportunity to ask questions related to their specific needs. âThe training programmes are tailor-made for the customer and their systemsâ, Thimm points out. In the event there is still a system downtime that the customer is unable to correct on his own, qualified Customer Support technicians offer around-the-clock support every day of the year worldwide, reducing downtime to a minimum. Our technicians can perform remote analyses, indicate corrective measures and offer quick and reliable solutions to correct the malfunctions, so the systems can be put quickly back in service. Additionally, we will also find the cause for the malfunction to prevent it from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Projects World-wide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beumer Group implements projects world-wide. For example, Beumer is the main contractor for the new distribution centre of a large iron ore exporter off the shore of Malaysia which consists of 17 troughed belt conveyors and a total length of twelve kilometres. The conveyors will ensure swift transport of iron ore from super-size freighters to the mainland. Beumer will deliver and install the conveyors, put them into operation and take full charge of engineering, all according to a strict timetable. At the port of Callao in Peru, Beumer will be installing pipe conveyors with a length of around three kilometres for transporting copper, lead and zinc concentrates by the year 2014. In Canada, Beumer is currently installing a conveyor with a length of 3.48 km for a large mining concern. This will convey iron ore at up to 6000 t/h. This large conveying system must withstand extreme temperatures of -40Â°C and heavy snowfalls. Beumer has designed all mechanical and structural elements to withstand extremely low temperatures. This system is equipped with a feeding belt conveyor and a discharge belt with shuttle-type discharger. With the takeover of Enexco Teknologies India Limited in 2011, Beumer Group has expanded its business activities in India as well. This increased the company&#039;s market presence in the cement industry in one of the most important growth markets world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speaking the Same Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beumer sets high standards for their customer support employees. When systems are installed and used in other countries, the compay believes that the customer should have access to a Customer Support technician that originates from the same cultural background and speaks the same language.âFor this reason we cannot just send any colleague from Beckum to Africa or Southeast Asiaâ, says Thimm. Successful customer support requires successful communication. How is the customer positioned? What are their goals and how do they want to develop in the future? These questions require tactfulness and cultural know-how. Beumer is a global company and capable of meeting this challenge. âWe are in permanent contact with the companyâ, explains Thimm. Beumer is not just dropping by for one or two days to do the basic maintenance work. The goal is long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âAs all of the systems used by the customer need to be complementary, we also take into account the technical improvements of parts produced by third-party manufacturersâ, says Thimm. Therefore, the technicians suggest adaptations to the mechanics and controlling systems of products that interact with Beumer machinery. âOf course, we know our competitors and their differencesâ, he explains. For products that are not part of the Beumer portfolio, Customer Support assumes the function of a general maintenance department: âIn case of malfunctions, we correct them and carry out the maintenance work as indicated by the third-party supplierâ, explains Thimm. In Nigeria, there are many Chinese suppliers in the market. Dangote uses many Asian systems besides the Beumer systems. âThat is why we have a service technician on site who has also a lot of experience with the Chinese market and its productsâ, says Thimm.&lt;/p&gt;

But while site operators have been quick to embrace the major health and safety advantages of using these lightweight rollers, their unique design is also providing an altogether new solution to a potentially explosive problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hostile locations where conveyor reliability and the risk of fire are critical concerns, Horizonâs tightly sealed aluminium rollers are proving to be a superior option. Specially designed to operate at stable temperatures and cut the risk of electrostatic charges, the rollers are not only lighter but also safer than conventional steel rollers in Atex environments where any excess heat, sparks or fire could have catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safety Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon originally developed aluminium rollers in response to industry concerns about the health and safety risks of using standard heavy steel trough and return rollers. Often weighing up to 90 kg, steel rollers can require extra manpower and prolonged downtime to fit and replace safely, particularly in high or enclosed spaces. Increasingly stringent health and safety rules mean that operators also have to carefully consider the risks posed to personnel from steel rollers during regular conveyor running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Bowler, the Managing Director of Horizon Conveyor Equipment, says the aluminium rollers retain the durability of their steel counterparts but boast the weight advantages, noise reduction and energy saving features that have made plastic rollers popular. Importantly, their high strength also makes them an ideal option for use on wide belts and in high impact locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said: âOur aluminium roller has all the weight and handling advantages of our HDPE plastic rollers but with the added advantage of extra strength especially for long return rollers. This is absolutely critical for operators who face real health and safety issues when attempting to replace failed steel rollers.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Light and Strong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed using 6 mm thick aluminium tube, the rollers contain a steel shaft and sealed bearings, with the bearing housings manufactured from electrically-conductive glass-reinforced nylon. A large stationary integral stone guard forms the outer primary labyrinth seal, which prevents any spillage building up between the roller and the frame which can jam the roller. Dust, debris and smaller contaminants are kept out by a greased inner cupped lip seal together with a sealed bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past three years the rollers have been in use at E-ONâs Kingsnorth Power Station, mainly on 1350 mm and 1800 mm belts. Clive Burfoot, Materials Handling Engineer for E-ON at Kingsnorth Power Station, says the weight of the rollers has been a major benefit on site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âWe have tested Horizon Conveyorsâ aluminium rollers for more than three years and have been very pleased with their performance,â he said. âWe decided to install them into a position of high tension, close to the pulley tail, to accelerate the tests and they have performed very well.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lower Risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the aluminium rollers offer immediate weight gains to site operators, their unique construction delivers superior performance and longevity in high risk environments. With heavy duty seals and sealed bearings, the rollers offer greater resilience in areas where fine dust from the likes of biomass pellets, wheat, sugar, flour and cement can be hugely damaging to standard rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following its conversion from coal-power to biomass, RWE Tilbury Power Station began trialling the aluminium rollers after finding that its existing steel rollers were failing at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Pannell, Lead Maintenance Engineer at RWE Tilbury Power Station, said that after careful monitoring the existing equipment and investigation it was found that extremely fine biomass dust was getting through the seals of the steel rollers and into their open cage bearings. âOnce any dust ingresses the seals and bearings, the rollers were generating excessive heat and that is a real problem with biomass dust,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE set out to find a solution that would reduce the risk of fire created through excess heat and roller failure but would also be light weight for easy installation. Horizonâs aluminium roller was chosen for its robust labyrinth and bearing lip seals and because of its electrically conductive bearing housing, which cuts the risk of sparks and prevents metal to metal bearing contact in case the roller should ever fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWEâs team at Tilbury put Horizonâs aluminium rollers through an extensive trial, which involved running them for a period and then opening the seals. It found that there hadnât been any ingress of biomass dust through the seals or into the sealed bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Alan Bowler at Horizon, the introduction of the aluminium roller range marks the latest development in nearly 30 years of research and design innovation. He was originally involved in the invention and patenting of the first non-metallic plastic-polyurethane rollers which were introduced into the South African market in 1980. He brought the designs to the UK and European market in 1995 and since then has established a range of steel, plastic and now aluminium rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said: âWe originally conceived the design for the aluminium roller with health and safety in mind. With tighter regulations and more consideration to the manpower and downtime needed to change failed steel rollers, there is certainly a need for a lightweight alternative. But the way we have constructed these rollers means they are also capable of solving a wide variety of problems and reducing risks in some very hostile Atex environments.â&lt;/p&gt;

Hourly the machine unloads up to 400 t of wheat from arriving ships. The wheat is milled and further processed by JÃ¤ckering MÃ¼hlen- und NÃ¤hrmittelwerke. The challenge associated with the logistics concept was the depth of the harbor basin in conjunction with the higher positioned silo hopper. In close collaboration with the customer it was possible to configure the Sennebogen 840 as the optimal machine, and it has now completely replaced the three former harbor rail cranes. In order to achieve an appropriate reaching depth in the hull, and simultaneously cover the height of the silo hopper, the machine was elevated by 2.7 m with a mast. The 840 M special has a 20 m equipment length with special materials handling kinematics. The all-wheel drive of the wide-gauge undercarriage also ensures flexible implementation of the materials handling machine along the harbor basin where it replaced 3 rail based cranes. Delivering up to 400 tph, the machine already delivers more than the existing hopper can process&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, ports are faced with less turnover [t/h] than expected. By mining data from a comprehensive field study, the ideal grab filling model was deduced. The self-learning system automatically adjusts its behaviour by recognizing bulk density, compression and granularity as well as current frame conditions like depth of impression or type of grab. Load cycle by load cycle, SmartGrip optimises filling to maximum capability taking grab size and outreach into account. Right from the second load cycle, the technology ensures that the grab filling rate is above the average of 70%. The company says that the system controls the filling of the grab to suit the load curve of the crane, leading to optimal utilisation without overloading and extending the lifetime of the crane.&lt;/p&gt;
