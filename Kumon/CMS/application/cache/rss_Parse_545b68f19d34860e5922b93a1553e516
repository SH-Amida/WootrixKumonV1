            <title>How to Start a Reliability Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/584987f6-8c68-4688-bcfc-2ac8706122a8_start-reliability-program-3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 253px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;Where do I start? I have heard this question many times, and there is no easy answer other than &amp;ldquo;pick a spot.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that normally when a company decides to start a reliability program, there are a lot of improvements to be made in other areas as well. I have never heard of a facility in which everything is perfect and the only thing they need to do is start a reliability program to become world class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is tied to almost every other area in a facility, and so when one area is at a low point, other areas are also suffering. I would call on all of the experienced reliability veterans to offer their suggestions to help those who want to start a reliability program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gather all of your best people, including the top people in production, maintenance, quality and safety/environmental. This group should have various levels of technicians, operators and management. The group should figure out the areas that need improvement. I do not only mean specific pieces of equipment, but all of the areas that affect reliability, such as training, scheduling, parts and tools. The list can go on, but the point is that you need to have a picture of the potential improvement to get some direction. The list of improvement areas needs to be prioritized so everyone can get on the same track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick the Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you know what needs to be improved, you can decide on the tools you need to start working. Sometimes the tools are already in the toolbox, which is great. If the tools are not in the toolbox, it is time to buy them. When purchasing tools, you want to buy the quality ones and not the bargain-bin tools that will fail to live up to the task. Some of the tools include root-cause failure analysis (RCFA), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), fault-tree analysis (FTA), life-cycle cost analysis, etc. The tools are not all related directly to reliability either. Your different areas &amp;mdash; planning/scheduling, quality, custodial services, etc. &amp;mdash; can have a profound effect on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Champion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The champion must be a person who is committed to the job and the future goals. Far too often, this hat is given to a person who already has a few hats, and it ends up getting shelved at times. That can impede progress in moving a reliability program forward. The champion also needs to have the power and ability to make changes happen and influence the decision-making process. Responsibility without the ability is a recipe for failure. The champion is normally a cost in the beginning, but over time will pay for itself over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many more things you can do to start a reliability program, but this is a great way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/7_GZ81tbmPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>People Make the Difference in Maintenance and Reliability Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people may have gravitated to the maintenance and reliability industry because of the desire to work with machinery. I was trained in engineering and understand how machines operate and work. Machines behave in logical ways. They all follow the mechanical and electrical laws of nature. Engineers are immersed in those laws in their years of schooling. People in the maintenance field thrive on knowing that machinery works and behaves in logical ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article for &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, I pointed out the thought similarities between an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety improvement effort and a maintenance and reliability improvement effort. The idea that zero injuries are possible is a key concept for any safety effort to gain momentum, but how does a plant or an organization really improve safety results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I have experienced over the past 30 years is a continual and steady safety improvement effort. In the early years, much of the emphasis was on identification and elimination of unsafe conditions. The focus was on the machinery and the physical facility. The elimination of unsafe conditions was a normal and comfortable task for many in plant operations, production and maintenance. It was easy to identify and fix defects in machines and facilities that could cause an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our efforts in these areas were successful and improved safety. However, we still experienced injuries. Many of these injuries were not caused by unsafe conditions but by the unsafe acts of our employees. As our organization recognized this fact, more work and concentration was put on preventing injuries due to unsafe acts. We have used various programs to improve our results in the past. Several of the programs used were the STOP program and TAKE 2 program, both created by E.I. DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past several years, we used a program that concentrated on people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors by enlisting these people in observing each other. These observations help remind everyone to think and behave safely. The emphasis was on changing the culture and attitude of the organization as well as on the people and how each person behaves. We have seen substantial improvement in safety results over the past few decades due to this focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similarity in leading a maintenance and reliability improvement effort and a safety improvement effort. Today, many of these maintenance and reliability improvement efforts are solely concentrating on the machinery. The program leaders may become enamored with the new technical tools that have exponentially become more capable and less expensive in the past 30 years. The condition-monitoring tools and precision-maintenance tools have dominated the industry&amp;rsquo;s attention in the past several years. Many others have focused on the analysis processes such as reliability-centered maintenance and root-cause analysis. All of these tools and programs are fairly technical and logical in nature. The tools and their application are very comfortable to maintenance and reliability leaders, managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Certainly, any effort needs to have competency in these technical skills. The need to understand how machinery operates, how it can fail and how to prevent failure is extremely important and foundational to any improvement effort. However, this aspect is the easiest part to lead an organization in the maintenance and reliability improvement effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe the most difficult but most beneficial aspect of leading the maintenance and reliability improvement effort is managing the change process in organizations. The behavior change process from a reactive state to a proactive state is a challenging transition. Leadership of this change process needs to focus on each employee&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. This certainly is not a comfortable action for most leaders. Employees must believe that machine failures can be prevented by proper design, operation and preventive maintenance strategies. This attitude change is facilitated by continual education on the fundamentals of maintenance and reliability principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, success leads the organization eventually to believe that zero failures are possible. When this belief takes hold, the organization begins to accelerate toward a true proactive state. Each person in an organization is important to enlist in this change endeavor. It happens one person at a time through various stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changing an organization&amp;rsquo;s behaviors and actions on a daily basis is one of the key areas that will accelerate the maintenance and reliability process. Are you and your organization&amp;rsquo;s leaders educated in change management principles and ready for this needed behavior change effort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/UGYixQBxbT8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability Reduces Waste of Time, Talent and Resources</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Waste is seen in many different forms in manufacturing. Some of these wastes include physical, time and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Physical waste is anything that is left over from the process that has to be discarded, recycled or sold. For every process, there is an expected amount of waste that is unavoidable. However, the waste that we will focus on is the excess waste that is produced because of equipment or process reliability issues. There are many processes that are a one-shot process, where if it is interrupted during the process, all of the materials become waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time waste also directly relates to equipment and process reliability. Any time that the system is down for unplanned maintenance, that means there is extra time required to make up the work, idle manpower and manpower required to correct the deficiency. In many cases, the extra time required to make up the work falls into overtime or extra shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Talent waste is the use of time and education to repair or correct process or equipment failures. There will always be the need for the use of talent to fix failures. The real loss is when the failures are preventable and nothing is being done to change the situation. The talent used to fix unnecessary equipment failures can be utilized to improve the process and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any angle from which you look at reliability will reveal that it is a necessary function to be a good steward of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/2PusA6Aoh94" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Share the Responsibility for PM Attainment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance (PM) is a cornerstone of reliability-based maintenance. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise then that PM attainment has become a key performance indicator (KPI). However, it may surprise you that in many organizations, maintenance is not primarily responsible for this KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance always has an important role, of course. It must create the PM program. It must generate, schedule and plan PMs. It also must have staff with enough skill to accomplish the PM. If maintenance is missing any of these things, it has a lot of work to do. But if PM attainment is already one of your current KPIs, these steps are probably already being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet if those planned PMs are not being accomplished, there is another likely reason besides maintenance capability. The most common reason for scheduled PMs not being accomplished is a change in the production schedule removing access to equipment and lines that were scheduled for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This doesn&amp;rsquo;t absolve maintenance for missing PM due to other reasons. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the material, people or tools on hand or has poorly estimated the necessary work, maintenance should be accountable. However, big blocks of PM tasks are often missed due to a change in the production schedule. This usually is not in the control of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason the schedule changes is often due to a short-term need for more production, frequently while there are complaints about the machinery not running well enough. Yet even when the reason for extending the production schedule is to overcome maintenance downtime, the stage has been set for even more downtime to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To hold me responsible for a KPI, I should have the means to control it. If I am the maintenance manager, I rarely control the production schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I like using PM attainment as a metric, my suggestion is for it to be a shared metric among both the production manager and maintenance manager (as well as the production planning staff, if you have one). They should all be held accountable if scheduled PM tasks are not being performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/nmCFUBQV3e8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Time Wasters for Reliability Engineers to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the catch phrases. You&amp;rsquo;ve read the success stories. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the return on investment (ROI) calculations and the positive trending that reliability engineers bring. You&amp;rsquo;ve even lobbied upper management. Your argument has been so convincing that you&amp;rsquo;ve secured approval in this year&amp;rsquo;s budget to hire a reliability engineer. The hiring process has begun, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the results: more reliable equipment, fewer failures and increased availability and production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If only it were that easy. Building a reliability program led by competent professionals takes work. It requires setting expectations properly. Most of all, it requires time. How do you accelerate the process to ensure the maximum benefit in the shortest time? Avoiding these top five time wasters could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether your reliability engineer could have been a fighter pilot or whether he needs bifocals, although not being able to read the computer screen while reviewing an asset hierarchy certainly will slow one down. A lack of an overall vision for your facility&amp;rsquo;s reliability program is the No. 1 reason for inefficiency and wasted effort, not just in a reliability program, but with any initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before I became a reliability engineer, I worked as a project engineer improving equipment performance through sound engineering principles. I often was involved in maintenance engineering activities, troubleshooting equipment failures as they occurred in the hopes of getting the plant back up and running as soon as possible. My boss had read an article about the benefits of having a staff reliability engineer, and literally overnight the reliability engineer position was initiated. I was then asked to take the job.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What changed? The title on my business card and the signature line on my e-mails. I continued to perform the same maintenance engineering activities without any real strategic direction, for we had no vision of what we wanted our reliability program to look like.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I worked within my means throughout the next year to learn more about what true reliability engineering was. I learned the difference between a condition-based maintenance strategy, a time-based maintenance strategy and a run-to-failure maintenance strategy, which we had (by neglect) been practicing at our facility for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I learned that a smart combination of the three strategies is ideal, depending on the criticality of the system in question. I educated my boss, and he educated his boss. We learned that reliability best practices are well-established, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We also discovered that there are no shortcuts. For example, if you want accurate failure data, you need to have a computerized maintenance-management system in place. It needs to have an accurate hierarchy that represents the parent/child relationships that represent your plant or facility. The system needs to be populated by operations and maintenance with work requests, failure codes and material/labor dollars so that accurate analysis can be performed. Building an accurate hierarchy takes time and money, and there are companies that have done it before which can help make the process less painful. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of any reliability program, and like a foundation for a house, if done poorly will result in imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Master Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once there&amp;rsquo;s an understanding of reliability best practices, you need a plan that&amp;rsquo;s in line with the reliability program&amp;rsquo;s overall vision. Develop a clear methodology that can be understood at all levels of your organization. It should start with an assessment of current-state reliability practices &amp;mdash; where are you and your facility now in your reliability journey? &amp;mdash; as well as well-defined tasks that can bring your program in line with your vision. As with any good project plan, these tasks should have well-defined dates and persons responsible for completion. Resources such as people, money and time should be defined, and proper approval from site leadership must be obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Communication is vital to ensure proper expectations are set and maintained. For example, if site leadership doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that before maintenance plans can be developed and optimized, site hierarchy needs to be established and a criticality assessment performed, then they&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re working on in all of those cross-functional development meetings, all the while not seeing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prioritization of effort is a challenge we all face, regardless of industry or occupation. In this economic environment, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly asked to do more with less, and there are only so many hours in the day. Where and how we, as reliability engineers, spend our time is of utmost importance. The reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming: developing cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical equipment; conducting root cause analysis investigations to eliminate or mitigate repetitive failures; implementing effective corrective actions; developing and ensuring proper use of facility management of change (MOC) policies and procedures; identifying limiting factors that lead to high energy, utility, maintenance and supply-chain costs. This list could go on and on, but the question remains the same: where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You and your site leadership can determine where the priorities are and address the most critical items first if you have a well-defined vision, a master plan and the proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Measuring Stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you know how well you&amp;rsquo;re performing? Are you and the reliability program getting the results you desire? Are they in line with the overall vision set forth in your reliability program? How can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Waiting for the year-end numbers is like looking at the final score of a football game to see how your team is doing: you might get the information you want but far too late to make the necessary adjustments. A robust reliability program has a strong mix of both leading indicators, which tell you how you are doing day in and day out, and lagging indicators, which tell you how you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I wanted to evaluate the success of a facility&amp;rsquo;s predictive maintenance (PdM) program, I&amp;rsquo;d need to understand the number of critical assets under surveillance, whether inspections are performed on time, the percentage of identified issues that get entered into the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS), as well as the overall program costs, dollar value of saves and annualized cost per unit asset. Once understood, such metrics foster informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no sense in reinventing the wheel. Such indicators should be clear, concise and make sense for where you and your facility are on your reliability journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you know it or not, all of us are on a reliability journey. Just as there&amp;rsquo;s no job that goes unplanned &amp;mdash; even an unplanned job gets planned haphazardly during the execution process &amp;mdash; we and the organizations we support make decisions every day that affect how smoothly the trip goes. Proper alignment and planning can help you avoid the first three time wasters. Proper execution circumvents the fourth time waster, and proper control mitigates the final time waster. Comparison to industry-accepted standards shows us how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and how much farther there is to go.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>When Are OEM Recommendations Not Enough?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This is a commonly posed question in industry and is sometimes inversely worded as, &amp;ldquo;Are OEM recommendations enough?&amp;rdquo; It quite simply boils down to an evaluation of two underlying issues. First, what do you get from original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations? Second, what do you consider to be enough or meeting the need? The knee-jerk response by many might be to challenge the validity of OEM recommendations for any and everything, but that leaves us to wonder how effective the alternatives might be and under what circumstances it makes sense to employ them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What OEM Recommendations Provide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is fairly commonplace to receive assets with an accompanying set of operating and maintenance manuals. The operating manual generally covers guidelines around the design-intended operating parameters (dos) and the limits or restrictions to operation (don&amp;rsquo;ts). The maintenance manual, on the other hand, often provides the user with the schedules for necessary maintenance, critical spare parts usage and basic maintenance work instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	How OEM Recommendations Are Determined&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The details of the dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts provided by the OEM vary widely, but it is not too difficult to imagine how they were developed. First of all, OEMs consider the engineering characteristics that will dictate what the asset is physically capable of. The next step involves the analysis of previous history from in-house and field tests by customers. Even with new designs, OEMs are able to draw upon a plethora of data that is often available for similar systems or components as reference, and any good OEM will continue to improve the recommendations as new data is made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other situations, based on the nature of the system, OEMs go further to employ very strict methodologies, such as reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) for the determination of recommendations. Depending on the mix of strategies employed by the OEM, the user and maintainer may have a valid concern about their credibility. Often it is next to impossible to get a true understanding of what their approach might have been.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Another prevailing concern is whether the OEM&amp;rsquo;s recommendations are more self-serving than being of any real benefit to its customers. Let us consider the case of the age-old recommended oil change intervals for automobiles of every 3,000 miles. It is the contention of most automotive experts that the oil change interval on most vehicles can be extended safely up to 10,000 miles when using synthetic oil and as much as 6,000 miles with regular mineral-based oil. Now, who benefits from too frequent oil changes? The dealers performing the maintenance? The quick lube shops? The oil companies? While the example might be simplistic, similar concerns are shared by many asset owners in industry regarding the frequency of maintenance being recommended. This, of course, benefits the markets for spare parts and for specialized maintenance services, but is this what is needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Your Assets Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The publicly available specification PAS 55-1:2008 from the British Standards Institute (BSI) offers some guidance. This standard recommends that every organization needs a systematic and coordinated set of activities and practices that sustainably manages its assets&amp;rsquo; performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles for the purpose of achieving the organizational strategic plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This suggests that the first consideration is to determine what the strategic objectives are for the business and then to determine how each asset supports them. Obviously, the degree to which the objectives depend on a given asset will determine how valuable its asset-management strategy will be to the organization. The process by which this is determined is known as criticality analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The asset&amp;rsquo;s criticality ranking should be one of the primary considerations used to determine how its control strategy is developed. Of all the approaches that are commonly used today, such as reliability-centered maintenance, total productive maintenance and all the standard risk-management plan development techniques, the blind acceptance and use of OEM recommendations must be one of the least effective. All of the previously mentioned techniques require due diligence to be done by reviewing OEM recommendations, but total reliance on them is only reserved for the least critical of assets.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	So when are OEM recommendations not enough? OEM recommendations are not enough for assets that fall in the medium to high criticality range. An old saying of biblical origin states that, &amp;ldquo;to whom much is given, much is expected.&amp;rdquo; In direct reference to assets, we could modify these sage words of advice to say that, &amp;ldquo;to the asset from which much is expected, much should be given.&amp;rdquo; Quite frankly, the guidance that most OEM recommendations provide can rarely be considered as &amp;ldquo;much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Keep Maintenance Simple: Use Senses and Sensibility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What good is it to have advanced maintenance techniques if they have no real benefit over simple basic maintenance? Now I am not saying go and throw away all of your fancy toys. What I am saying is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have advanced tools for every maintenance task. I have seen many maintenance groups that have adopted certain maintenance techniques and, in turn, overuse them on everything they can be used on. The point is, why use them if they are not cost effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many cases in which a failure can be detected with an operator&amp;rsquo;s or technician&amp;rsquo;s built-in test equipment that takes no special training to use. This equipment is his or her senses &amp;mdash; sight, sound, feel and taste (not recommended). These are all skills that should be taken into account when performing any kind of maintenance analysis. In many cases, a technician or operator can detect a potential failure in adequate time to mitigate the consequences of a functional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many different improvement programs use criticality to determine what maintenance they need to use to effectively manage their asset. If a functional failure has no impact on safety, environment or operation and minimal economic impact, and an operator or technician will normally detect the failure in plenty of time, why would you use any tool that costs more than just the standard senses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the different maintenance improvement programs being used today employ logic that helps guide the decisions on what maintenance to perform. This logic normally includes probability of failure and severity of the failure. This approach can help avoid performing unnecessary and costly maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/fsYUycgY8mQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Reliability Excellence is Imperative for Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We tend to speak about financial issues more than moral issues in the business world. Safety is an issue that has significant ramifications from both moral and financial perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety is a financial imperative in today&amp;rsquo;s business world. According to a 2010 Liberty Mutual study, the annual documented direct and indirect industry cost of U.S. workplace accidents totaled $240 billion per year. The average cost to industry for a fatal accident ranges from a low estimate by the National Safety Council of $1.27 million to the enormous average of $8.6 million per fatality paid out by BP after its refinery explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to an Air Force study, the average cost of a permanent disability is $1.3 million, while a partial disability costs $210,000. Workers&amp;rsquo; compensation premiums, which correlate directly to your accident and incident rate, amount to millions of dollars per year in even a modest-sized company. Any way you look at it, accidents are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dollars and cents aside, no manager or supervisor wants to ever have to face a distraught family and tell them that their spouse or parent will not be coming home tonight. It is hard to look an employee in the eye at the hospital when you know that his or her injuries could have been avoided. Even minor injuries can take a serious toll physically, mentally and economically on everyone involved. I think we can all agree that accidents are an employee event that industry does not want to pay for and nobody ever wants to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The premise of this article is that facilities that rank high in terms of reliability excellence also have superior safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There have been some statistics published that show the relationship between recognized measures of reliability and an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety performance. The source data has not been all that well-documented, but the relationship has been observed many times. Improving safety should be seen as the journey toward reliability excellence proceeds. Rather than focusing on boring cost data and correlations, let&amp;rsquo;s explore why a state of reliability excellence supports excellence in safety performance. For it is from the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; that you can learn how to improve safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the 2010 survey, the top five types of accidents in terms of compensation were falls, electrocutions, injuries from working in confined spaces, fires and explosions, and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The causes of these accidents have their roots in unsafe conditions and unsafe behaviors. Both of these factors are positively influenced by the journey to reliability excellence. What sort of unsafe conditions and behaviors exist in reactive facilities that &lt;u&gt;do not exist&lt;/u&gt; where reliability excellence is in place? Here are a few common ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leaks and spills that contribute to falls and some fires exist in plants where maintenance people are not deployed efficiently and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; defects like these have to be tolerated. Operators do not keep the equipment clean and in good order. Thus, the sources of leaks are not identified and corrected easily at an early stage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Falls often result from temporary hoses and pipes, poorly barricaded &amp;ldquo;emergency work&amp;rdquo; areas, and the seemingly inevitable debris that there is &amp;ldquo;never time to clean up&amp;rdquo; before proceeding to the next emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Electrocutions often occur because of poorly maintained electrical grounding systems and power tools. In a reactive facility, there never seems to be enough time to ensure that grounding checks are made, and that GFCIs are always used. Other electrocutions occur during emergency troubleshooting and repair of equipment. Often there is &amp;ldquo;not enough time&amp;rdquo; or the organizational discipline is lacking to perform LOTO consistently. Poorly planned high work near power lines is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Confined space injuries occur largely because of the lack of individual or supervisory discipline within the organization necessary to adhere to confined space procedures. Poor job planning and insufficient preparation for confined space entry also play a role. The absence of consistent employee training is often cited. Constant job interruptions and the rush associated with urgent work compound the situation by contributing to poor decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Although falls account for the largest number of fatalities, fires and explosions always get attention. When you dig into the root causes of fires and explosions, you come across these contributors: poor configuration management (control of alterations to materials, process and procedures), leaks and spills, and lack of a disciplined adherence to procedures. In a reactive plant, procedures get bypassed and alterations and material substitutions are made to compensate for emergencies and poor material management systems. Leaks, spills and general poor housekeeping literally &amp;ldquo;add fuel to the fire&amp;rdquo; when one occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Burns not occurring as a result of fire are often attributed to hot liquid leaks. Leaks abound in reactive plants. In process plants, a very common cause is poor thermal protection condition, such as pipes and vessels with missing or damaged insulation. In a reactive facility, costs are high and manpower is generally scarce. Often one of the first things to be sacrificed is &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; leak repairs and the condition of insulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These fundamental root causes are present in the top five accident types. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how a reliability excellenceenvironment mitigates or eliminates these root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Procedures and Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No procedures or poor discipline to follow existing ones are characteristic of a reactive environment. Within reliability excellence, work processes and procedures are fundamental. Creation of process and procedure is one of the first steps taken in the implementation of reliability excellence. Discipline results from setting expectations, measuring results and holding people accountable. It is also the reliability excellenceresult of establishing a culture that encourages and rewards a disciplined approach. Disciplined does not mean stagnant. Structured continuous improvement is an integral part of reliability excellence, but the days of the &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cowboys&amp;rdquo; are over. Reliability excellenceemploys the principles of change management to develop the right culture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Poor or no job planning and a high level of emergencies set the stage for accidents. Lack of planning forces people to hurry and &amp;ldquo;make it up as they go,&amp;rdquo; creating opportunities for errors. In the reliability excellenceenvironment, more than 90 percent of jobs are planned and scheduled. Emergencies are few because effective preventive maintenance programs are in place. Chronic failures are systematically identified and corrected, and the root causes eliminated by loss and failure elimination processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient Maintenance Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reactive sites consume budget money and craft resources in huge quantities. The poor or omitted maintenance that creates an unsafe work environment often exists due to lack of money and people. When good work execution practices are in place as a result of reliability excellence, the productivity of the maintenance organization increases by as much as 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers using effective loss and failure elimination processes significantly reduce the number of chronic failures. These and the preventive and predictive maintenance programs developed and deployed in a reliability excellenceimplementation extend the equipment mean time between failures and eliminate much unnecessary emergency work. The overall cost of maintenance goes down, while the level of maintenance goes up as resources, once poorly utilized reactively, are now available for proactively addressing all of the maintenance needs of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Temporary&amp;rdquo; hoses and pipes as well as debris left behind from emergency repairs or only partially completed maintenance create an unsafe work environment. In a proactive environment, emergency repairs become the exception. Craft people are not pulled away from partially completed jobs to deal with the next emergency. In addition, every job includes the time to render the work area safe and clean before moving to the next job. General housekeeping improves as well. Indeed, 5S is integral to reliability excellence. Clear expectations and scheduled tasks generated by the operator care function result in operators who have the time, the ability and the desire to maintain a clean and safe workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Configuration Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uncontrolled changes often create unsafe process and equipment conditions. There is a history of major industrial accidents resulting from poor control of changes. Condition monitoring is one of the fundamental components of a reliability excellenceimplementation, thus ensuring an appropriate level of procedural safeguards is in place. Often the need to make changes is the result of a reactive environment. Parts and material substitutions occur when the material management function is not working, and a breakdown occurs. World-class material management practices ensure that the right parts in the right amount are at the right place at the right time. The failure elimination process eradicates most chronic and unpredictable failures. Between the two, much of the need for emergency work-arounds, which are often the drivers for configuration management failures, simply goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Either from neglect by reactive leadership or from lack of necessary resources, training is often poor quality or non-existent. With reliability excellencecomes reduced failure rates, less severe failures, more productive use of craft labor and the ability to schedule effectively. Process interruptions become rare. Both the time and money to train your people become available. The world-class target of 2 percent of labor hours devoted to training becomes not just possible but desirable. Root-cause analysis of failures helps to target specific training needs. Tracking systems that are integral to the process validate the effectiveness of your training dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Decision-Making/Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lack of process, asset and organizational stability in a reactive environment forces people to make decisions under time pressure, often reacting to totally new situations. Process upsets and equipment breakdowns generate overtime, which is frequently excessive and unplanned. This leads to fatigue, which leads to poor decision-making and errors and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human-error rate tables indicate that the average trained and competent person performing a routine repetitive task under no unusual stress will make a mistake roughly once every 500 times he or she performs it. Add fatigue, being in a hurry and having to perform non-routine tasks, and the error rate increases to roughly once in every 25 actions. In the right (or rather wrong) emergency conditions, the error rate can be as much as one in four. It is little wonder that the accident rate is so high at facilities that have unstable processes and unstable equipment. Reliability excellence introduces stability, predictable work schedules and lower stress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Management Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In sites where it is a daily battle to make production and keep poorly maintained assets running, it is hard to find the time to focus on improving safety. When assets and processes are stable and under control, when you have the resources to maintain the facility at peak condition, and budget pressures are lower, then you have the time, energy and ability to focus on safety. Reliability excellence creates this very environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, whether for moral or financial reasons, reliability excellence is an imperative for a safe and profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>10 Questions to Attain Reliability at the Lowest Cost</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to ensure equipment reliability at the lowest possible cost, you have to plan for it. With any asset, you need to address the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the equipment function? The primary function? The secondary function?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the desired performance?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How long do you plan on it operating (i.e. service life)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What will the operating context be (i.e. 24/7/365, tropical or frigid climate, abrasive process)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the consequences of failure? How will you mitigate the consequences?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have you identified the failure modes through failure modes and effects analysis (i.e. the Blow Out Preventer [BOP] with 260 failure modes)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the probability of failure with any of those failure modes?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How will you find those prior to failure during the failure detection window?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What will be the mode of restoration (i.e. repair in place, replace, rebuild offline)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How will you minimize the impact to production if you miss the failure in the failure detection window (i.e. mean time to repair or maintainability)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too often, there is no real plan as many choose to shoot from the hip. Take the time to create a strategy for your assets to attain increase reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/Qr5pFjUghnE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Monitoring the Performance of Your Asset Management System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All reliability-centered continuous improvement programs must include both a process that effectively assesses the condition of the plant&amp;rsquo;s capital assets and a monitoring process. The British Standard Institution&amp;rsquo;s Publically Available Specification (PAS-55) states, &amp;ldquo;The organization shall establish, implement and maintain process(es) and/or procedure(s) to monitor and measure the performance of the asset management system and the performance and/or condition of assets and/or asset systems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The specification indicates your Asset Management System (AMS) must address both reactive and proactive monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A reactive monitoring process identifies past or existing nonconformities in the asset management system as well as any asset-related deterioration, failures or incidents. This sounds straightforward, but how do you cost effectively monitor or measure nonconformities in either the management system or physical assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A comprehensive AMS includes how the corporation&amp;rsquo;s physical assets are procured, commissioned, operated, maintained and disposed of.&amp;nbsp; It consists of &lt;em&gt;standard processes and procedures &lt;/em&gt;that govern production scheduling, operations and maintenance of these assets. If you only have one asset, this is relatively simple, but how do you effectively monitor compliance to standards across the enterprise for all assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most cost-effective way to monitor compliance of the processes and procedures used across the enterprise is to design or re-engineer the processes with performance monitoring in mind.&amp;nbsp; An often made mistake in performance monitoring is the deployment of technology and the technically skilled people to manage it with little or no consideration of the processes or metrics used to drive performance.&amp;nbsp; An alternative and less than ideal approach is to create processes that periodically audit or sample the processes, procedures and practices that are being used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Proactive Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proactive monitoring seeks assurance that the physical assets and the AMS are operating as intended. In reality, this requirement is the same as reactive monitoring. The only difference is timing. It&amp;rsquo;s like the difference between Root Cause Analysis and Root Cause Failure Analysis. Both are analytical tools that resolve real or potential problems. The difference is when you perform the analysis. If you perform it after the failure or incident, it is reactive. If you perform it before the failure, it&amp;rsquo;s proactive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Again, the best solution is to build monitoring and analyses into the &lt;em&gt;standard work processes and procedures&lt;/em&gt; that are used to perform all tasks or activities that directly or indirectly affect asset performance and reliability. This is done through key performance indicators designed to measure true leading and lagging indicators of asset performance and condition, as well as the work processes or procedures used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain them. This will only work with true indicators. For example, preventive maintenance compliance is only valid as a leading indicator when the right tasks are performed, at the right time and on the right asset.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it might in fact be non-value added work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Leading and Lagging Indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An AMS that depends on &lt;em&gt;lagging indicators &lt;/em&gt;is by definition reactive. To be proactive and effective, the AMS must also include &lt;em&gt;leading indicators&lt;/em&gt; that foretell non-conformance or deficiencies that can be expected at some point in the future. The mistake that too many companies make is limiting their AMS indicators to maintenance or failure-centric deficiencies. They limit their focus to things such as preventive maintenance compliance, wrench time and maintenance planning effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; While maintenance and failure or breakdown performance is important, much more must be considered and monitored for the AMS to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a minimum, the leading and lagging indicators must include all of the performance indicators that define the operating effectiveness and efficiency of assets, both physical and human.&amp;nbsp; Indicators such as labor hours per unit, cost of goods sold, energy usage per unit, etc., are effective leading and lagging indicators that provide the means to manage assets effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The obstacle we must first overcome is how to monitor and evaluate the performance and condition of critical assets and the massive volume of data that must be acquired, manipulated, interpreted and finally converted into actionable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many have tried to create autonomous systems &amp;mdash; some manual and some computerized &amp;mdash; to extract the raw data from the myriad of data systems throughout the enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Even the few who have managed to fully integrate their enterprise information management system and have automated most of the process still need the data interpreted and corrective actions determined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once structured performance monitoring is in place, the financial opportunities that lie within your asset management system will become apparent, and mitigating and eliminating these limiting factors will lead to real performance and continuous improvement. The result is greater asset utilization and a higher return on net assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Quintessential Asset Management:    The Road to Reliability-centered Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Asset-management programs and software are getting a lot of press these days. Every maintenance engineer and his site manager are writing a white paper and/or book about the value of asset management to a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. There are measuring tools and concepts galore, all intended to provide an instantly successful maintenance process. Much of this content makes achieving reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) sound relatively easy and commonplace. This fosters a misguided concept that RCM and CBM are commodities that can be purchased and implemented in short order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to explain how to gauge where a company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program stands and where its goals need to ultimately lie, we need another catch phrase that is all encompassing of the total maintenance-management-process approach and ultimate goal. How does Quintessential Asset Management (QAM) sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the five levels of asset-management development a company usually passes through leading to more advanced processes such as CBM and RCM to eventually achieve QAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s define Quintessential Asset Management as the culture, processes and tools required to efficiently maintain an enterprise&amp;rsquo;s equipment for optimum production. Like anything else in business, it&amp;rsquo;s all about profitability or bang for your buck. Like anything else, there are trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to have real-time data and dashboards at your fingertips when you want to make a decision, but achieving this level of technological sophistication requires discipline over a period of time despite business trends that tend to ebb and rise. Maintenance is not unlike a safety or quality program that might get put on hold or abandoned during periods of slow business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies may cut back and lose top-notch, irreplaceable experience that comes back to haunt them when business picks up, instead of being patient and thinking in the long term. During these slow periods when a company has the available human resources, those who would be process &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; will dedicate themselves to value-added projects like maintenance improvement not only for the benefit of the company but also for their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The word quintessential comes from ancient physics as the fifth element that holds the other four elements of earth, wind, air and fire together. Think of maintenance as the fifth element that brings and keeps a profitable asset-driven business together. In modern English, quintessential has come to mean the model of a concept. For example, you may have heard people say Joe Montana was the quintessential quarterback. He may not have been flashy, but he got the job done by being efficient, reliable and interacting well with his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In embarking on your QAM journey, the first questions to ask yourself are where is your company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program and where do you want to take it. An enterprise needs to establish a valid benchmark of where it stands, set realistic goals and then evaluate its progress honestly and openly at predetermined intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development and maturity of a maintenance program isn&amp;rsquo;t unlike that of a human being. In its infancy, everything is reactive. The machinery breaks, and the production people are screaming for attention. Since there&amp;rsquo;s not a maintenance history to draw knowledge from, repairs are more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a program advances and the technicians learn the equipment and start figuring out preventative measures, it moves toward adolescence where it needs more structure. Then as technology and information systems around maintenance and asset management develop around automated communication processes and historical data, the challenge becomes the move toward proactively and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it&amp;rsquo;s mature, decisions need to be made based on experience that can push efficiency even further. It is at this level where RCM (reliability-centered maintenance) can be effectively implemented. A few years of historical data and a comprehensive asset-management software system need to be in place before an organization can begin to decide which equipment is truly critical. RCM methodologies can now be used to maintain equipment while developing trends showing where they might save money by doing less maintenance or even running some equipment to failure. Once these processes are in place with a plan to monitor and further improve them, QAM has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 1- Disruptive/Reactive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everything has to start some place, and maintenance is no exception. There is no equipment history to fall back on, and all maintenance is reactive. Some enterprises start manufacturing or servicing products that don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge maintenance until it literally bites them in the balance sheet. Some welder or machinist will do minor repairs on failed equipment, and service representatives will be called in for major issues. As time goes by, the failures start really creating production problems and can actually cause a viable business to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 2- Folders and Spreadsheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level two, companies start hiring maintenance mechanics and might even allow one to sit behind a desk a certain percentage of the time in order to plan maintenance and keep records. It is at this stage that calendar and operational time based PMs are put in place and technicians start keeping an equipment history. Many companies only move to this level to appease some quality standard for their industry such as QS or ISO. Many companies stay at this level indefinitely, perhaps due to a prevailing notion that if a technician isn&amp;rsquo;t turning tools on a broken machine, he&amp;rsquo;s wasting time. More proactive planning and management are not seen as value added items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/5b89ecbe-2f7d-4881-a7e3-f5ffd61072df_QAM1.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 357px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;In this screen shot, notice that the graphical representation of the equipment structure is hierarchical and navigable. &amp;nbsp;The equipment records and work-order screens are scalable. Shown is a more mature representation of an equipment object with documents attached. This can be simplified dramatically to only show the fields and tabs in use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 3- Basic CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At last, a computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) has been approved and a team has been assigned to investigate the costs and approaches required to follow through on that commitment. &amp;nbsp;There is support from management for the project, and a few champions have stepped up to take the lead on software selection and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies make the mistake of paying good money for a CMMS but cut corners on implementation. This is an example of what&amp;rsquo;s called stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. They consider the time required to collect and input pertinent data as time the technicians could be applying to the equipment instead of realizing you have to put good data in to get good data out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, other well-meaning implementation teams try to do too much right out of the gate. They want to use every available field on a fault report or work order before they even understand many of the key performance indicators (KPIs) they ultimately want to monitor. Letting a system evolve to some extent always makes the best sense. Time is money, and it requires time to enter data in the system. Having a technician fill out a field that&amp;rsquo;s not necessary is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the maintenance system develops, using a particular field may make more sense but is not available because it&amp;rsquo;s already being used and full of impertinent information. Poor implementation also results in a situation where the equipment isn&amp;rsquo;t set up correctly or the information entered into the system is based on guesswork. It makes sense in many instances to be patient and wait for work history to identify needs. A well-designed maintenance program will optimized with age. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need a plan of where you want to go with the system before you set up the implementation. Lay out phases and goals with timelines. Benchmark where you&amp;rsquo;re at and schedule intervals of honest evaluation. Hire the right consultants to help you. They may or may not be the software vendor. Be sure to have your best maintenance people on the core team who are getting input from the technicians and in-house subject matter experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for in a CMMS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obviously, the first thing you want to make sure of is whether the company providing the software is going to be around for a while and has a structured product-improvement model. You want it to be scalable so your program can grow into the tools the CMMS has to offer, including KPI dashboards, trending and possible real-time data-capture feeds from machine-operation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Is the input simple and does the navigation feel intuitive? Other important facets are equipment structures that allow quick visibility of cost roll-up. You will also want preventative-maintenance tools that provide scheduled work driven by calendar, accumulated value such as machine hours, and events such as all maintenance due for a shutdown. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have fault reports that can be put in quickly but have the capability to be followed up with lots of planning detail as well. Equipment history should be accessible quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with CMMS implementation, this is a good time to introduce simple, less expensive conditional components such as oil sampling and infrared thermography. A year into a CMMS project and with simple conditional checks, there should be enough information to start developing and harvesting KPIs and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/ca060a8d-13ea-4324-8948-f3e3af3020b2_QAM2.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 399px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Built-in navigational tools including this PM for Object Structure table enable you to see each the PM for each particular piece of equipment as well as all PMs for the equipment in its structure. IFS PMs can be to the specific object of a route and can be generated in several ways including calendar, criteria data (accumulated values such as hours and cycles as well as minimum and maximum limit values), and events such a planned shutdowns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 4 - Integrated CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level four, a maintenance organization begins to seriously consider how its CMMS interfaces with other systems in the company, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), equipment monitoring and project-management software. If a maintenance team is cutting purchase orders and doing material requisitions in an ERP while doing double entry by manually recording the costs or actually duplicating them in the CMMS, it&amp;rsquo;s time to consider investing in an integrated package or pay for direct interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a company has been planning ahead in earlier phases of development and selected a software package that offers both ERP and CMMS functionality (called enterprise asset management or EAM), it can more gracefully, cost effectively and efficiently move toward greater integration without bringing in armies of high-priced consultants and systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;If a plant has a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start considering a direct interface of data (hours, strokes, alarms). Pretty much all the monitoring programs and some CMMSs are compatible through OLE Process Control (OPC) interfacing. It makes sense to have remote sampling and real-time monitoring feed directly into the CMMS in order to cut back on the man-hours necessary to collect and enter data and to avoid misreading that leads to junk data in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the integrated CMMS phase, a maintenance organization can also look at integrating its maintenance-software tools with project-management software that can deliver equipment directly into its CMMS. This is a huge step toward greater efficiency and the ability to manage assets over its entire lifecycle from engineering, installation, commissioning, operations, maintenance and straight through the decision to refit or replace. Machine installations, plant expansions and relocations all have asset-management relevance. True Asset Lifecycle Management (ALM), or what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as &amp;ldquo;cradle-to-grave&amp;rdquo; tracking, begins at the design and/or installation level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a42881bb-6163-46fa-a66e-ad8e396d2510_QAM3.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 484px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Equipment Object Cost screen shows real-time costs on the equipment with a single click. Notice the Houston facility is highlighted showing the cost of work against the facility itself and the cost against the equipment within its structure. Clicking on any object in the structure will give you the associated real-time cost analysis without running a report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Condition-Based Maintenance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A condition-based program can be incorporated into the maintenance program in order to garner value by doing less replacement before failure and requiring less preventative-maintenance hours. We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed oil sampling and infrared thermography, which can be relatively inexpensive. Some other prevalent types include vibration monitoring and analysis, ultrasonic noise detection and non-destructive testing. These are all areas that require specific expertise and assessment on their potential value before implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of people want their CMMS to do this specific data collection and analysis for them, but this is impractical. No software can do everything effectively, and you should question anyone who says he can. The CMMS just needs to have the ability to have the data attached to it. Let the specialist specialize where it makes sense and don&amp;rsquo;t fall into that &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits-all&amp;rdquo; pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/7e558402-d205-4eeb-9cb9-05084456225c_QAM4.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 481px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 5- Quintessential Asset Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now you&amp;rsquo;re at the QAM pinnacle. You have all the tools in place to actually implement RCM. You can decide what is truly critical equipment instead of what seems like it would be according to tribal knowledge, but really isn&amp;rsquo;t. You have dashboards and key performance indicators that are real time and at your fingertips. You can make repair/replace decisions quickly and easily. You can make &amp;ldquo;run-to-failure&amp;rdquo; decisions with accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a3435b28-608a-40ee-a7f2-ae69ecac13d4_QAM5.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 449px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFS Maintenance work orders are seamlessly integrated with IFS projects, which allows an installation, upgrade or expansion project to be planned, created and monitored using IFS Projects while still having the ability to drive costs from work order to the equipment. You can also deliver the new equipment directly into equipment structure using Project Delivery.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	QAM is a model of how an asset-management program develops. You can throw all the buzzwords you want at it, but it comes down to common sense and a plan. While the right technology is important, it is your organizational culture that will really separate the wheat from the chaff and determine if you get to RCM or not. A company needs a vision of where it&amp;rsquo;s going and how to get there, other than a few rows and columns on a budget spreadsheet. The people, processes, dedication and discipline are what make a maintenance program successful. Software, monitoring equipment, reliability premises and performance indicators are just tools that automate, guide and gauge your success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Life Cycle Engineering Launches Lean Implementation Services</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In response to requests from its clients in manufacturing and process industries, Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) has added lean implementation services to its consulting and services offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A professional engineering firm with more than 30 years of experience, LCE remains at the forefront of establishing reliability excellence as the preferred approach for companies seeking to improve their performance. LCE&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Powered by Rx&amp;rdquo; methodologies are inclusive of critical lean concepts and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob Fei, LCE&amp;rsquo;s president, shares: &amp;ldquo;Launching a lean services group is a natural addition to our core reliability consulting practice. Lean concepts and principles have always been core to our reliability excellence implementation methodologies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over the past several years there&amp;rsquo;s been a pull from our customers to provide support and subject matter expertise for their lean implementation activities,&amp;rdquo; explains Mark Ruby, senior vice president of LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Consulting Group (RCG). &amp;ldquo;In response to this demand, we&amp;rsquo;ve formalized our approach to lean by creating the LCE Lean Implementation Model and have also added additional subject matter expert resources to support the increased demand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Toyota Production System recognizes that operational stability is foundational to an efficient and effective production system. &amp;ldquo;LCE&amp;rsquo;s core competencies of reliability engineering and maintenance best practices deliver that critical stability,&amp;rdquo; Ruby points out. &amp;ldquo;Another key differentiator in the LCE approach is our expertise in change management. All RCG consultants are certified change management professionals.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The LCE Lean Implementation Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The LCE Lean Implementation Model is based upon four associated phases. While there is no &amp;ldquo;right answer&amp;rdquo; on which concepts should be implemented first, the LCE model recognizes that operational stability is foundational to successfully creating flow and establishing pull and therefore provides a general progression of implementation steps with stability as the first priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The progression from left to right begins with observing, organizing and evaluating. This phase is critical for establishing a business case and setting clear direction. It typically begins with an educational component and some level of assessment. Strategy deployment and effective leadership follows and is supported by a robust change management plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once a shared vision and a method for managing change have been established, the model progresses to the next phase of developing, implementing and improving. This phase begins with a value stream mapping exercise that helps focus problem solving while establishing which key lean concepts are critical for developing a path forward. Implementation activities are both system and process-based and can deliver immediate bottom-line results. As operational stability improves the stage is set for progression through the following phases of connecting supply and connecting demand. These stages focus on material flow, JIT and production-leveling concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the process the model focuses on developing effective leaders with a clear vision who create, engage and lead a highly motivated and involved workforce through the transformation. Over time, a culture of continuous improvement evolves, producing sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Abanaki Releases New Edition of Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CLEVELAND, OH--(Marketwire - April 12, 2011) - Abanaki Corporation, the world leader in oil skimming and coolant maintenance products, announces the new updated edition of its Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook for solving oil removal problems.&amp;nbsp;The new handbook offers expanded information about oil skimming principles, applications, technologies, installation tips, and how to select and size an &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234940&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fskimsel.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In addition, this complete oil skimming guide shows comparative skimmer types as well as turnkey systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An electronic version of Abanaki&amp;#39;s Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook is a handy resource for environmental engineers, plant maintenance personnel, wastewater treatment engineers, manufacturing engineers and related professionals looking for a solution to their oil contamination problems.&amp;nbsp;A complimentary copy of the new Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook may be downloaded from Abanaki&amp;#39;s website at &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234943&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2f157"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;http://www.abanaki.com/157&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil skimming is the most economical, low-maintenance method for removing floating oil, grease, fuel and other hydrocarbons from water. As the oil skimmer belt or tube passes through water, the contaminants are attracted to the media and carried to wiper blades where the oil is removed.&amp;nbsp;Oil skimming uses the differences in specific gravity and surface tension between oil and water to pick up oil, grease and other hydrocarbons. Companies use Abanaki &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234946&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fmodel8.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a wide range of applications from meeting EPA and municipal pollution standards to improving coolant quality in machine tool operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The 5 biggest risks to effective asset management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to the PAS-551 standard on asset management from the British Standards Institute, asset management is defined as: &amp;ldquo;systematic and coordinated activities and practices through which an organization optimally and sustainably manages its assets and asset systems, their associated performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles for the purpose of achieving its organizational strategic plan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Embodied in this definition, of course, are assets of various types (physical, financial, human, information and intangible), which all contribute to the organizational strategic plan. Best practices dictate that an Asset Management Plan, comprising of three main sub-plans (Operations, Maintenance and Risk) or its equivalent, be developed and implemented for physical assets. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The main focus of this article will be on physical assets, but you will find that some of the risks to asset management identified herein will be shared with the other asset type categories. The author suggests that there are at least five such risks that primarily contribute to an organization&amp;rsquo;s failure to optimally manage their assets: 1) not knowing what they have; 2) over- or under-maintenance; 3) improper operation; 4) improper risk management; and 5) suboptimized asset management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Not knowing what you have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In common manufacturing industry parlance, this is known as the FDH (fat, dumb and happy) approach to asset management. While it might seem intuitively obvious, many organizations either don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate the need to know with a high level of confidence, the assets that they have or they choose not to take the time to do so. Either way, this has to be the first major step taken towards ensuring that one&amp;rsquo;s asset management program is effective. Not knowing what one has is tantamount to playing a game of Russian roulette. If an organization is truly serious about their program they will need to take the following steps to establish the proper foundation to build upon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a list of all the organization&amp;rsquo;s assets and verify this list with what is in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish and configure a physical asset hierarchy. ISO 142242 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) can be used as reference.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop the criticality evaluation criteria for the business and apply to the verified asset base. This is where the individual assets are linked to how they affect the organizational strategic plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop and implement a management of change or configuration management process that will ensure that any future changes to the asset are properly evaluated and recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Over- or under-maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	During the operational phase of the asset life cycle, there can be a problem of over-maintaining as well as under-maintaining. The key issue regarding over-maintaining typically involves two issues that will make the asset management system ineffective. First, there is generally a significant cost associated with the execution of non-value-added maintenance. In this regard, cost can be loosely used as a guideline since there are well-documented industry benchmarks for maintenance spending that can be followed. Second, the typical organization that can be accused of over-maintaining its assets will most likely be performing intrusive maintenance tasks more frequently. From what we know of how typical failures manifest, this means that there will be additional exposure risk for the business to infant mortality failures and further incurred costs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The issue of under-maintenance and how it prevents effective asset management is even more clear-cut. Maintenance is often viewed as a business expense open to cutting like any other in order to maximize profits. With these pressures, maintenance departments are constantly struggling with how to balance cost with the performance requirements for the assets such as reliability and uptime. Cost-cutting often wins, however, in the form of delayed proactive maintenance as well as maintenance technicians lacking the necessary skills and tools to perform precise work.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With respect to both the issues of over- and under-maintenance, the author&amp;rsquo;s recommended approach is, starting with the most critical assets, determine the optimum maintenance requirements of the assets through one of the more rigorous methodologies such as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Then, load level the resources (financial and human) required to implement the maintenance plan. Finally, ensure that a training plan is in place to close the skills gap of the persons required for the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Improper operation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations suffer first of all from a lack of understanding of the inherent design capabilities of their assets and, secondly, how best to operate within their ranges to optimize the asset life cycle. For some assets, either operating below or above the design range adversely affects the life of the asset. A perfect example of this is the typical centrifugal process pump, as illustrated in the pump curve in Figure 1. Operating on either side of the best efficiency point on the curve is accompanied by a myriad of life-shortening issues. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we do when we choose to speed things up, slow things down or continuously operate assets that were designed to be intermittently run. The best guidance that the author can give with respect to this issue is to: 1) find out how your assets should be run; 2) understand the effects of operating outside of design ranges; and 3) if you can&amp;rsquo;t operate within the ranges, understand the risks or mitigate the risk (example: resize the impellor to match the operating point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/e7899f1c-3915-4640-b3d5-f5421df98c5a_LCE.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Improper risk management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The basic tenet of best practices asset management dictates that a plan is implemented that not only manages the operation and maintenance of an organization&amp;rsquo;s assets, but also manages the risks associated with the ownership and use of the assets. Risk, in its most elementary form, is a function of consequences and the likelihood of such an event taking place. Risk management takes place on two major fronts: 1) assessment or identification; and 2) management and controls. Each area, when not done well, is a continued contributor to ineffective asset management. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to stretch the imagination too far to understand this concept. Perform a Google search on the &amp;ldquo;Bhopal Disaster&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, widely regarded as the world&amp;rsquo;s worst industrial catastrophe, for an example of unassessed and unmanaged risk. In order to fully manage risk, the author recommends that the following four step model, by ISO, be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish context&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk assessment: Risk identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk treatment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor and review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Sub-optimized asset management systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In recent years, enterprise asset management (EAM) systems have become more popularly used within organizations to manage assets. Most systems have inherent deficiencies that prevent holistic management of all the required areas of the plan. As a result, additional secondary systems are often necessary. That being said, of the features that are available from most EAMs, many organizations are guilty of not fully utilizing them. This generally stems from shortcuts taken during the EAM implementation. The way to fully address this issue is to either do it right the first time or pay more to do it later. The author&amp;rsquo;s personal preference is the former. This takes planning, resources and treating the implementation as a major change program and not just a project. This is easier said than done, and is often best when supported by the services of change management professionals and asset infrastructure specialists. Apart from the tools (EAM, secondary systems) and technical solutions, we often fail to recognize that our human resources and business processes are important parts of an organization&amp;rsquo;s asset management system. A lack of due diligence in these areas will also negatively impact the bottom line and should be planned for as well.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Asset management is an integrated approach to optimizing the life cycle of your assets, beginning at conceptual design, through to usage, decommissioning and disposal. By acknowledging and paying attention to these five primary risks to effective asset management, you can put in place plans to mitigate the effects these might have on their program. Note also, that true excellence in asset management performance does not lie only in avoiding the pitfalls, but in turning each and every one of these opportunities to fail into an opportunity to excel.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CBM and RCM help to maximize safety, uptime at YICT</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Being one of the biggest single container terminals in the world brings certain expectations from the operators and customers alike. Professionalism, reliability and efficiency are three of the most important and, coupled with a high regard for safety, are major focus areas for the Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), in Shenzhen, southern China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With 74 mammoth sized cranes lining the five deep water berths and about 10 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers a year coming in and out of the terminal, it is an extremely complex task to keep everything running smoothly and safely. But the management of YICT have followed a Total Quality approach to their terminal from the early planning stages through the construction phase and into the running of daily operations. Today, Six Sigma is a guiding tool for process improvement to many things, including the entire maintenance strategy and operations, and their Quay Crane maintenance manager is a Six Sigma black belt. At the YICT Engineering Control Centre he has an ultra modern overview, via CCTV and other monitoring technologies, of many of the equipments and machinery, down to individual electric motors, needed to keep the terminal operating 24 hours round the clock .&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wide-ranging maintenance strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	YICT has applied and included all the various technique and technology in their maintenance strategy starting with time based, then adding condition-based (CBM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) that now ensure the right balance, from a cost and effectiveness viewpoint, for the vast array of equipment and systems under his supervision. One example the company gives is that a CBM approach to a particular gearbox allowed a solution to be made within 2 weeks, compared to 2 months at a port where a similar gearbox, operating on a time based maintenance program, failed unexpectedly. So although they had a potential failure to deal with, the financial and operational damage was only one quarter of that experienced at another port.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the ultimate techniques within a CBM and RCM program is continuous online monitoring, implying that the earliest signs of potential failure are recognized, and fast and adequate corrective action can be taken. It is not the answer to all maintenance concerns, but used wisely it is a very good investment to protect operationally critical or safety critical equipment. And this is an area that YICT has been moving into regarding their quayside cranes. They have now completed a three-year test period with SKF online monitoring technology on gearboxes on two cranes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety &amp;ndash; a key concern&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The monitored gearboxes are positioned 100 meters above ground in the &amp;lsquo;workhouse&amp;rsquo; of the huge dockside cranes. The gearboxes drive the roll drums that lower the heavy duty wire cable that is used to lift the heavy containers on and off the ships and container transport lorries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number one concern here is safety. A sudden failure or seizure of a gearbox could cause a container to swing away from its intended path of movement or drop some meters before the automatic braking system could hold the cable and container in place. With so many people constantly moving around the terminal such gearbox failures are a high priority to avoid. Additionally with a &amp;lsquo;suspended&amp;rsquo; container and an &amp;ldquo;out of commission&amp;rdquo; crane, there would be the loss of productive and throughput capacity to the terminal operators, the container owners and the end customers, who are waiting for the container goods to be delivered.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical components continuously monitored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A major potential cause of gearbox failure is some kind of failure of the bearings that support the gear shafts. Although bearings are high performing mechanical systems, like all machine components and systems they can wear or become damaged over time depending on various conditions of operation, loading, operating environment, etc. If left too long before replacement a catastrophic bearing failure can result that could lead to a gearbox failure and the potential dangers mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The SKF online system monitors the health of the gear shaft support bearings via vibration sensors placed at specific places on the outside of the gearbox housing. Bearings have particular vibration &amp;ldquo;signatures&amp;rdquo; when working well, working poorly or suffering from wear. And these signatures differ for different bearing types, sizes and loading conditions. So it is important to &amp;ldquo;trend&amp;rdquo; and study each bearing and its operating cycle separately to get a reliable picture of the health of each one. To do this, vibration data is sent to and stored on a server in the Engineering Control Center for later analysis. By constantly monitoring the vibration signals YICT has been able to confidently asses the health of the bearings and, with it, the potential of increasing or excessive bearing wear and associated gearbox failure. So far they have been able to happily continue running the gearboxes and no failures have occurred.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Because the loading and speed conditions of the gearbox varies during operation it requires special skills and knowledge to interpret the vibration signals correctly. SKF provided close support and advice to YICT engineers during the first year of running and remained on-hand during the next two years of operation. Additionally, YICT engineers attended SKF courses on condition monitoring to improve the own knowledge and skills levels.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving on with confidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Equipped now with fully trained condition monitoring engineers and three years confident experience, YICT is keen to expand the condition monitoring to more cranes and will investigate SKF&amp;rsquo;s latest technology. With 32 analogue channels and 16 digital channels, the new system will allow bearing, gearboxes and motors to be monitored at the same time, saving a lot of maintenance costs in the process. And this will be another step in YICT&amp;rsquo;s continuous process improvement Six Sigma-driven program that delivers professionalism, reliability, efficiency and safety to its port&amp;rsquo;s machinery and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/JvWDeY35Sb4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability planning: The earlier, the better</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Proper planning prevents poor performance.&amp;nbsp;Cutting out the&amp;nbsp;roof to extract a critical motor with a helicopter is not the definition of proper planning. Significant thought into maintenance considerations and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) should be&amp;nbsp;part of new project planning. A facility with proper maintenance and reliability planning stands a better chance of maximizing throughput and availability, making them more competitive in the&amp;nbsp;marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why you need world-class motor management and maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ask a manufacturer how long a motor it makes is expected to live, and the response will be something like, &amp;ldquo;20-plus years in the right environment.&amp;rdquo; Ask the same question in a facility that uses such a motor, and the answer is more likely to be, &amp;ldquo;If we get five years out of it, we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!&amp;rdquo; Why does this discrepancy exist? Why do motors die of an infant mortality instead of living to the ripe old age for which they are designed and built? The answers have to do with the failure to optimize motor management and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a shift in philosophy with regard to motor management and maintenance. Companies no longer regard it as a cost center or a necessary evil. Rather, optimizing the lifespan of motor assets is now considered an opportunity. Business owners have come to recognize motor reliability as a decisive variable in overall profitability and competitiveness. Previously, they purchased information systems and software programs to attack the challenge from different vantage points, but until now, technology has not provided a turnkey solution for optimizing the motor management and maintenance processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Four Levels of Software: A Puzzle with Pieces Missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Now companies recognize that optimal motor management and maintenance brings greater reliability. Greater reliability, in turn, ensures the best return on asset values, as well as less downtime and, therefore, more cost-effective manufacturing. This recognition led to the birth of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), a coordinated approach to maintenance, communicated through a centralized base and directed toward the overall reliability of assets and machinery. There are four levels of technology that facilitate this coordinated approach. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 1: Technology-level software.&lt;/strong&gt; The software in this category has been limited to identifying health concerns with motors. It is designed around widely accepted standards for motor reliability and delivers alerts and alarms recommended by IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) or NEMA (the National Electric Manufacturers Association). These serve as a first level of notice that something is wrong with the motor or with the system in which it is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 2: Information management software.&lt;/strong&gt; A handful of software tools are available that are designed to organize information about a specific asset so that a supervisor, planner or technician can rapidly identify trends or indications of problems related to that asset. Much of this information amounts to historical data on a motor that allows personnel to track which systems the motor has been installed in and what kinds of problems it has encountered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 3: CMMS, centralized maintenance management software.&lt;/strong&gt; Best-of-breed CMMS packages provide centralized information management on a company&amp;rsquo;s motor assets in a variety of technologies &amp;ndash; electrical, mechanical, vibration and others. It is the central location where work requests are initiated and work orders are submitted and authorized. The software tracks each asset&amp;rsquo;s work request and work order history so that personnel can look up the status and type of maintenance or repair work currently being performed on an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 4: EAM, enterprise asset management. &lt;/strong&gt;Top-level recognition of maintenance as a critical portion of business decisions is the driver behind popular business-level software programs such as those produced by SAP. CMMS software is often linked directly to a company&amp;rsquo;s EAM platform so that reliability and return on investment (ROI) of assets can be monitored directly at the highest levels to ensure cost-effective and competitive manufacturing. Some EAM programs include their own CMMS modules, which are, however, not usually best-of-breed software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While each of these technology levels is critical to the overall picture, they only present partial pieces of the puzzle. What has been missing is a turnkey approach to tracking motor management and maintenance cradle to grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cradle-to-grave Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ideal technology supports the entire motor management and maintenance effort from cradle to grave, without the need to purchase and integrate several software packages. The process of assuring motor reliability begins with specification. It continues on to quality control upon receipt of the asset, then to proper storage, to pre- and post-installation verification, to monitoring the asset while operational. The final stage of the process is having the right information to recognize when a motor has become afflicted with a terminal disease or is near the end of its life for other reasons. Then the process begins again with a replacement motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Precision specification.&lt;/strong&gt; Cradle-to-grave management software includes a tool for precision specification, a growing trend in motor management. When forward-thinking companies buy a motor today, they begin with stringent specifications to make sure it is the highest-quality motor available in the marketplace. They know that it is more cost-effective in the long run to purchase a superior, highly reliable motor than to pay a low price up front and then waste resources on frequent repairs. A cradle-to-grave approach to motor management includes technology that allows motors to be pre-qualified at purchase to &amp;ldquo;design out&amp;rdquo; potential problems from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Quality control.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality control is a paramount but often overlooked component of reliability. Motors are sometimes defective upon arrival. As such, much testing, troubleshooting and repair down the road could be avoided with solid-quality control at the time of receipt. The old adage is, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a car that was built on a Friday. In other words, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a motor and count on its warranty, hoping for the best. Starting with a new motor that is 100 percent perfect will increase its long-term life expectancy and decrease reliability concerns with its installed application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Scheduling and tracking.&lt;/strong&gt; Scheduling and tracking are important to the efficient use of a motor in any industrial environment. For example, just like a human body, a motor needs regular checkups and maintenance so that any trends pointing toward a health problem can be identified and corrected or reversed before they become terminal illnesses. Because problems directly or indirectly related to a motor can be very subtle, thorough tracking of a motor&amp;rsquo;s history can identify negative trends. Such tracking must be automated because people are generally too busy with other tasks to keep notes on the history of motors. While everyone has good intentions about maintenance, it is generally eclipsed by other priorities. Further, the population of workers available to perform testing and analysis on motor assets is dwindling, making the need for automated scheduling and tracking that much more vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another important reason for tracking a motor&amp;rsquo;s reliability and maintenance history is to be able to recognize the point of diminishing return. If a motor&amp;rsquo;s problems and repairs are not tracked, investments may be made in maintaining and repairing it when it is no longer cost effective to do so. For instance, if a motor has been rewound 13 times, another rewinding is inadvisable because the motor will be very inefficient despite this maintenance effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact is that if maintenance activities are not scheduled and tracked, they probably will not occur. Furthermore, in the absence of automated scheduling, analysis and trending of data to identify conditions leading to lower reliability, potential problems will be overlooked, and the plant&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Predictive testing and trending.&lt;/strong&gt; Testing and trending needs to be predictive rather than just preventive or reactive. Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify that important distinction with a medical analogy. Regular medical checkups are predictive in that the findings may predict illnesses. A preventive measure would be taking vitamins on a regular basis to minimize the risk of unhealthy conditions. However, since the body eliminates excess vitamins, it is not necessary to be predictive about taking vitamins, which would amount to taking a blood test every day. Being reactive about one&amp;rsquo;s health would mean to stop eating junk food once diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Like medical checkups, software-enabled predictive maintenance is designed to identify conditions that are conducive to failure or lower reliability, so that they can be corrected to increase the life expectancy of an asset or motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cradle-to-grave reliability software tracks the history of repairs, or mean time between failures, to show faults so that their source can be identified and remedied. Without such historical information, repeated repairs or continual cleaning of a motor may waste a company&amp;rsquo;s resources on correcting symptoms while missing the real disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Tracking installation history. &lt;/strong&gt;Tracking the history of a motor itself is not enough. Turnkey reliability software also tracks the history of the systems in which the motor is installed. This is particularly important when a motor is used in a number of different systems, from fans to pumps to compressors. If a motor fails as part of a pump, is sent to repair, installed in a fan, fails again, is repaired again, installed in a compressor, and fails yet again, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware that the motor has failed every time and to know why it failed. Knowing whether it failed for the same or a completely different reason each time is critical to making a decision about its future. If analysis shows that none of the failings are related, the motor may still have 10 years of life and is, therefore, worth maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say a motor&amp;rsquo;s application history shows that its last failure was due to a ground fault when it was installed in a ventilation fan. A review of the fan&amp;rsquo;s history reveals that all of the last three motors installed in it failed due to insulation to ground. A common fault mechanism has now been identified and can be further investigated. A technician is dispatched to the site and discovers that the motor above the fan is leaking grease into the fan&amp;rsquo;s motor. If the history of the fan and its motors had not been tracked, several more motors might have failed, wasting resources on repeated repairs. Again, it is critical to automate the tracking of where a motor has been and what problems it has encountered so that personnel can focus on making the right decision rather than spending valuable time on analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New turnkey software at the technology level now enables the comprehensive management and maintenance of motors through all of these important stages of an asset&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; from precision specification to recognizing when the motor must be replaced. In short, this is cradle to grave. The software also delivers that information to asset management platforms so that senior management can make decisions that will continue to increase the company&amp;rsquo;s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Solution to Last a Lifetime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime. A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>TOTAL develops maintenance and inspection strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All oil and gas exploration and processing projects should be supported with a tailored strategy for their maintenance and inspection requirements, and facilities should be started up with their maintenance and inspection program properly defined by function and should be readied in systems that will support the execution of that work. These are typically big support activities covering all equipment and their sub-assemblies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Such projects are also extremely complex due to the number of equipment tags that must be addressed, the level of detail for critical and vital equipment, and the accuracy of attention to ensure expected operational uptime at the same time managing risks. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why such program developments traditionally have been carried out as separate activities by most oil and gas companies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But now, French oil and gas company TOTAL has taken the bold step to combine these maintenance and inspection engineering (MIE) activities. It has contracted SKF to develop the complete engineering strategy for its new Indonesian gas extraction and processing plants.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Tasked with the challenge of managing this &amp;ldquo;new adventure&amp;rdquo;, Philippe Grosbois, contract manager for TOTAL, was enthusiastic and confident halfway through this two-year project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have well-experienced teams at TOTAL for the execution of both maintenance and inspection routines,&amp;rdquo; said Grosbois. &amp;ldquo;They know the oil and gas industry and they know all of the machines and equipments that make these plants run. What we needed, in addition, was an experienced partner to develop a maintenance and inspection strategy based on best-in-class practices carried out on similar equipment in oil and gas, and other industrial applications. Much of the equipment &amp;ndash; such as pumps, motors, compressors, gearboxes &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp;are used in other industrial plants, as is much of the power generation, electrical and instrumentation needs that our Indonesian project will utilize. Our goal was to use best-in-class practices and routines to optimize our plant reliability and efficiency; machinery uptime; and gas production, transportation and processing; and to reduce our maintenance and inspection costs. In full compliance with Indonesian regulation PTK07 factors, we evaluated a number of potential service suppliers, and finally the MIE contract was awarded to SKF. Their track record of delivering successful similar projects and their policy of keeping best-in-class databases and applying latest methodologies and technology were key factors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The project also is a first for TOTAL E&amp;amp;P Indonesia because the maintenance and inspection strategy will be developed and applied for one sea-based gas extraction plant and four land-based processing plants. Such a five-plant application has not been simultaneously implemented before. Grosbois is expecting time and cost synergies and savings due to a large degree of overlapping and replication as each of the processing plants is constructed and comes on line.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Major project steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The major steps in the project will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;A criticality review.&lt;/strong&gt; TOTAL will identify all items in each plant, including rotating equipment, electrical, instrumentation, etc., by unique name coding and carry out Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and failure mode studies, where necessary. Further, it will classify each item into one of the categories: vital, critical or secondary.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Risk-based inspection assessments.&lt;/strong&gt; TOTAL will perform such assessments for pressure systems, including piping, using its in-house software.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Data entry.&lt;/strong&gt; A dedicated team will enter all plant items and unique coding into templates for later upload into TOTAL&amp;rsquo;s computerized maintenance and inspection management system (CMIMS).&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;RCM analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; TOTAL will determine and produce a specific maintenance plan for each plant item. Each plan will include what maintenance must be performed, when it will be done, how it will be done, and what tools and equipment are needed.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Lubrication excellence.&lt;/strong&gt; TOTAL will develop an overall lubrication and greasing schedule to the equipment level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project provides the justified content for TOTAL&amp;rsquo;s SAP system for the maintenance and inspection functions across five new facilities ready for startup.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The full scope of the contract requires that SKF also deliver a spare parts management program that identifies spare parts items for vital and critical plant items over a two-year time span. SKF&amp;rsquo;s history in supplying products and solutions for rotating machinery has allowed it to accumulate much knowledge for determining the parts most sensitive to requiring replacement throughout the life cycle of the machine. This will enable TOTAL to start operations and continue running with the right balance of the optimal number of spare parts, the optimal cost and the ability to maintain plant reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimal outcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Grosbois believes that a key to success has been the co-location of TOTAL and SKF teams in the SKF offices in Jakarta. With such close proximity of the teams, any questions or technical concerns can be dealt with immediately. And with such a big and complex project, questions occur each day. The ability to easily schedule meetings to discuss the weekly and monthly reports speeds up problem solving and enhances the progress of the project.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Project progress is monitored closely and mutually against key performance indicators agreed upon in the contract specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the specific project deliverables, Grosbois sees this groundbreaking project as an opportunity for TOTAL Group to test the combining of maintenance and inspection strategies in single projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Already, I have been able to identify a lot of value, knowledge and methodologies being transferred from SKF to TOTAL and am anticipating that many of these will provide valuable learning that can be replicated inside TOTAL and deliver quite some advantages,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Even though, at times during the contract, there have been setbacks and learnings that SKF has had to do, we will succeed in completing the project on time, within budget, and deliver all the components and benefits that we expected when we signed up with SKF. TOTAL is among the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, and this project shows that we are committed to continue developing our company in all areas to retain and extend our operational excellence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continuing the challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The challenge as this project enters its latter stage is to transition to the field operations function a workable package that is suited to the capabilities of that organization. The success of the project comes ultimately when the new work is actually executed well in the field. This project &amp;ldquo;sets the scene&amp;rdquo; for optimal life cycle costs. SKF is also intimately aware of TOTAL and its local operations and will continue to help the company with its pursuit of those optimal life cycle costs, while managing its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Survey seeks respondents on how to sustain reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ARC Advisory Group is undertaking a survey to better understand manufacturers&amp;rsquo; approach to reliability for the management of physical assets.&amp;nbsp;ARC hopes to better understand the organization&amp;rsquo;s objectives and strategy, what assessment tools have been implemented, and the improvements realized. In addition, it also hopes to understand an organization&amp;rsquo;s commitment to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers are facing a variety of challenges including a mass exodus of skilled labor and related knowledge base, operating with aging equipment, environmental, health and safety issues, mountains of data to process, and energy management concerns while simultaneously producing quality product. Reliability of operational assets is proving to be an effective tool where the benefits can be directly impact the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), predictive maintenance (PdM), Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and root cause analysis (RCA) are just some of the many techniques available that are designed to maximize productivity through improvement in maintenance and operations practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Should Participate in this Survey?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This survey is designed for, and should be taken by, end-users at the executive, management and plant level who are involved in the maintenance and operational aspects of an organization, and have knowledge about the business situation of their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If there is someone else in your organization that could also contribute, feel free to invite them to also take the survey. All answers are kept strictly confidential, and no company specific information or individual responses will be disclosed. Furthermore, ARC states that it does not disclose the fact that you participated in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benefits of Taking the Survey&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Respondents can view preliminary results immediately after they take the survey, and all will receive a free summary report after the research is completed. The survey is designed to take less than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey can be found at &lt;a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e2nh4lflg2xmlno8/start"&gt;Sustaining Reliability&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/uTTId7kiKvU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Failure Modes of Equipment Reliability Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance manager Robert was up to his elbows in grease and looking for spare parts. On his way to the supply room, he met Ron, the corporate reliability manager. Robert was in a hurry, but he took time to greet Ron and make small conversation. Robert told Ron that when time allowed, he would like to speak with him about several machine reliability issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Where are you headed in such a hurry?&amp;rdquo; asked Ron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The press is down again and I&amp;rsquo;m looking for parts&amp;rdquo;, answered Robert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ron responded by asking, &amp;ldquo;When you get it repaired, will it break again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Of course it will. We have a lot of reliability issues with the press.&amp;rdquo; said Robert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ron responded by saying, &amp;ldquo;Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re working on the wrong thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Robert did a quick double-take and chuckled. He thought Ron was joking. &amp;ldquo;When the press is down, that&amp;rsquo;s where I need to be. Would you have me working on something that isn&amp;rsquo;t broken?&amp;rdquo; chuckled Robert. He realized that Ron wasn&amp;rsquo;t joking when Ron asked, &amp;ldquo;Is it possible that the press failed because the maintenance process is broken? A good, reliable maintenance process would help to insure that the press remains in reliable operating condition?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The conversation was beginning to make Robert feel uncomfortable, and he had important work to do. Robert felt that Ron was a nice man, but was now talking some pie-in-the-sky theory. Walking away, Robert said, &amp;ldquo;Gotta go, Ron, but we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the issues that I mentioned, for sure, when we get up and running. Nice seeing you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Except for the names, the above conversation is true and demonstrates that most equipment failures are a result of failed reliability processes. This article covers many of the reasons why equipment reliability processes fail. The authors have personally observed all of the reasons for reliability process failure discussed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Implementation Failure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It can be rightfully argued that all equipment reliability process (EqRP) failure modes are somehow tied to poor implementation. Not establishing an initial direction is a critical mistake in the implementation process. Establishing clear goals and expectations and a clear direction can increase the success rate of an EqRP. If upper management fails to communicate the expectations of the program, accountability can never be achieved. The authors have witnessed millions of dollars being dumped into reliability processes that had no established direction and goals. The Penn State manual &lt;em&gt;Operating Equipment Asset Management&lt;/em&gt; identifies some critical elements that should not be overlooked when instituting the EqRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Top-down vision, drive, participation, support and clear, ambitious objectives are elements that should not be overlooked on implementation. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to examine this entire publication before implementing an EqRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Not Understanding the EqRP (Equipment Reliability Process)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Sometimes a company will have the best of intentions for implementing an EqRP, but no one in the company may have an understanding of how machine reliability is achieved. Sometimes a person in the company may have the necessary knowledge, but they are overruled on important issues that could insure success of the EqRP. Knowing how to maintain equipment for the desired reliability requires knowledge that is acquired through training. If that knowledge isn&amp;rsquo;t present, no EqRP will bring plant reliability. There are a few good ways to maintain machines and thousands of poor ways, but there is only one best way for any given machine. It is critical to choose one of the good processes and work toward making it the best EqRP for your plant. In short, it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible to maintain a machine to required reliability if machine reliability isn&amp;rsquo;t fully understood. If managers and plant personnel don&amp;rsquo;t truly understand the EqRP, they will lack confidence in the process and will be destined to failure. Many EqRPs fail simply because the managers and practitioners don&amp;rsquo;t have confidence that it can deliver the required results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Lack of Accountability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	These days, we hear much about empowerment self-direction. This sometimes leads to the idea that everyone can do their own thing as long as they do those things with good intentions. The authors are strongly in support of empowerment and a self-directed workforce as long as the empowered conform to the directives of the EqRP. The EqRP is not perfect and will need to be continuously revised and improved, but the basic framework, if correct when chosen, should remain intact. Any modification should be subject to a formal management of change. Everyone in the plant needs to be held accountable for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corporate managers often fail to keep the EqRP on track by letting small factions steer off course with practices that vary from the EqRP. This is the result of the corporate manager either not understanding the EqRP or not having confidence in the EqRP. Too often, corporations turn over the management of an EqRP to managers who have had success in non-maintenance areas, but have little or no reliability experience. Combine the lack of reliability experience with no established goals or direction and you have induced a failure mode right out of the gate. How can people be held accountable when they don&amp;rsquo;t know what is expected from them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Market Conditions Cause a Change in Plans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Too often, companies are willing to invest in various programs when times are good. Sometimes this is even to the point of waste. But when markets go sour, policies are changed in order to conserve dollar assets. In such times, EqRPs may have funds cut to the point that past gains are lost. The EqRP may not survive a bad market. Companies should develop spending strategies that are stable regardless of market conditions. A wasted dollar can never be recovered. Some producer will sell products even in down markets. The lowest-cost, highest-quality producers will survive difficult times. A good EqRP is an important factor in enabling a company to be the low-cost, high-quality producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Commitment Falters over Time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When mangers fail in the implementation of the reliability process, it allows other failure modes to begin eroding the program. If the direction and expectations are not initially established, accountability has no teeth. Without accountability, the commitment from upper management becomes viewed by the people as being more relaxed with each and every sunrise. Before long, even upper management forgets the initial purpose of the program. As the perceived importance of the EqRP lessens, the commitment is shifted to other programs or issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Failure to Measure Results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	You can&amp;rsquo;t measure what you can&amp;rsquo;t quantify, and what gets measured gets done. The difference between a well-designed metrics system and a poor one can be detrimental to improvement efforts. A metric is essentially a clear, quantitative, objective measure to assess performance in a particular area or progress toward a goal. A good computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) coordinator can pay big dividends when helping establish metrics and deciding how data needs to be measured within the CMMS. Most systems can generate good, consistent reports if it is set up to do so. However, most of these systems are grossly underutilized, and companies are too dependent on CMMS coordinators to decide what can be measured and what can&amp;rsquo;t be measured. The metrics should be established by a committee with the EqRP goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma has been used on the process side in a lot of companies for sometime now. It could be argued that the utilization of black belts and green belts on the maintenance side could be beneficial, and in some companies, they are utilized in that capacity. But in the author&amp;rsquo;s experience, that generally was not the case. Managers sometimes concentrate on standard deviation of product moisture content and overlook mean time between failures. Assessment results can&amp;rsquo;t be consistent without good, solid metrics. Too many times, the authors have witnessed variations in assessment scores from one facility to the next because of inadequate metrics, peer pressure and managerial perception. Nothing can compromise the integrity of an assessment process more than the perceived inconsistencies of the assessment team&amp;rsquo;s scoring procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Cultural Integration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A company may establish a reliability steering committee, select champions and mentors, even train their entire workforce on cultural change. They may then hire outside people to oversee the EqRP. Is it really a good idea to hire outside people to fill roles such as plant reliability engineers, planners, schedulers, plant managers and maintenance managers, especially, if these people have little or no reliability experience? Sometimes the outside people may come from a completely different industry that doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the manufacturing process or from the same industry but from a run-to-fail culture. Fosters of EqRPs should guard against infiltration of cultural integration. If people are brought in from different cultures, they should be in complimentary roles and trained in the company&amp;rsquo;s culture before taking on major roles in the EqRP. Too often, a little outside influence causes regression back into the run-to-fail maintenance of yesterday&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Lack of a Strategy for Managing Equipment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Even though condition-based monitoring methods may be established, strategies for managing equipment are still needed. Condition monitoring is a requirement for good machine management, but other strategies also should be incorporated into the EqRP. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) are two good tools that should be considered to help with the management of equipment reliability. Consider setting up pilot machine centers and conduct RCM or TPM projects. The information learned from these pilot projects can then be transferred to similar machine centers in other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Failure Mode: Low-Hanging Fruit Syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When these types of programs are initiated, the benefits are quite obvious. Just about everything attempted &amp;ndash; from instituting an oil cleanliness program to condition monitoring or failure analysis &amp;ndash; reaps big initial benefits and everyone is happy. But, just as soon as the low-hanging fruit is picked, a program with no direction or structure starts to look more like a dog chasing its tail. Unfortunately, this happens too often in industry. Someone suggests an EqRP and it seems like a good idea when you look around and see all of the potential for improvement. But, the EqRP is an ever-changing process and every bit of beneficial juice has to be squeezed out of the reliability process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both authors agree that all of the potential failure modes of an EqRP seem to point to several key elements, such as commitment to reliability, accountability and sustainability. We have witnessed some success and eventual regression of EqRPs based on some or all of these failure modes. There are other failure modes, but the ones mentioned here have been witnessed by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to apply the correct maintenance strategies to your assets</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies have recently implemented reliability initiatives geared toward optimizing the maintenance function at their plants. Some are successful; however, most will admit they did not realize the expected benefits. While there are many approaches to successfully implementing a reliability program, I will discuss a proven model for improving a company&amp;rsquo;s Reliability-Based Maintenance program through maintenance task optimization focused on failure elimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by assuming we are dealing with a large plant with many programs already implemented as they attempt to move toward Reliability-Based Maintenance. A computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is utilized to manage the operation, a large inspection-based preventive maintenance (PM) program has been built, and a relatively large predictive maintenance (PdM) program is in place to monitor asset condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the pieces of the reliability puzzle exist, but improved cost and reliability results have not been realized because integration of the separate systems has not been considered, leaving each system sub-optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, programs like those listed above are viewed by organizations as &amp;ldquo;stand-alone&amp;rdquo; programs. Yet if there is a concerted effort to refine and integrate all of the programs already in place, we will typically see increases in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) with a significant reduction in maintenance spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starting Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Success is typically measured by the improvement to the company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. To achieve the financial success of any project, the key cost drivers addressed by the project have to be understood. For example, a plant may measure types of work (preventive, predictive, failure and modifications), labor and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us assume we are looking at a plant where approximately 15 percent of the work is predictive, 35% is preventive, 25% is unexpected failure and approximately 15% of the PM is delinquent each month. In addition, the organization may have a gross overlap between preventive and predictive maintenance activities. Overlap costs money and it occurs for a specific reason. It is important to understand the reason before developing a maintenance strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plants can spend many years building PM programs, and they are encouraged to create PMs because they are rewarded for reduced failure when a PM process is implemented. Over time, these PM systems will grow to include inspections for all manner of failures. There can be a negative experience related to a failure, requiring the addition of a PM. The frequency will be set and the PM applied to every piece of equipment that is similar to the one that failed. The consequences or the nature of the failure are usually ignored because they have no bearing on meetings with superiors explaining the failure. The machine failed, the boss is unhappy, and PM makes the boss less unhappy. Over time, the number of PMs increases to the point that many aren&amp;rsquo;t being completed; even with an extensive PM program, there are still failures that can&amp;rsquo;t be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A plant would begin a PdM program by monitoring a few pieces of highly critical equipment with vibration analysis (where there usually is some success). Of course, success is a positive reward, and to increase that success, the program would grow. If the organization has a lot of support corporately for implementation of PdM, they would typically apply the technology to 50% of their known assets and use all available technologies. To determine how many assets to monitor, the plant should determine how many technologists it can support and then buy the equipment needed to perform the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In neither case, PM nor PdM implementation, were the failure modes, effects or consequences of failure evaluated to determine the cost-effectiveness or even the feasibility of the maintenance task to truly predict or eliminate failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example, a plant may use a predictive technology to monitor bearings, but frequently sends a mechanic to tear down an asset and inspect the same bearings. The ridiculousness of this may seem fundamental. However, it is common in industry. Because of this, we must first discuss the methodology before describing the implementation steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The principles used to correct such inefficiencies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All maintenance tasks must address a specific failure mode&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the least expensive and most effective task to maintain the asset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The maintenance task interval will be such that it addresses the failure at the optimal point in that asset&amp;rsquo;s failure cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The total cost of the failure must exceed the cost of the tasks to maintain the asset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PM should ultimately be a time-based refurbishment, not an inspection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failures created by operating an asset outside of capability cannot be maintained. The asset must be redesigned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To illustrate this approach, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the P-F Curve shown in Figure 1. Author John Moubray uses the P-F curve in his book &amp;ldquo;Reliability-Centered Maintenance II&amp;rdquo; to demonstrate the timeliness and effectiveness of PdM tasks. Points have been placed along the curve to represent a period of time (P-F) from defect detection point P to functional failure point F. Logic tells us that the longer the warning period, the easier it is to support the planning and scheduling effort necessary for an efficient, Reliability-Based Maintenance organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What we can readily see by studying this curve is that PdM tasks have the ability to identify failure-creating conditions at a longer P-F interval than PM tasks. In addition, the PdM task may be more suited to identifying the failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further analysis of the labor required to perform the work shows us that from a financial standpoint, PdM tasks, on average, are one-fourth of the cost of a PM task used to detect the same failure mode. In addition, PM is proven to introduce failure that otherwise would not happen. This early failure is often referred to as infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An additional, and often the greatest, financial impact is production downtime. PdM tasks are usually performed while the equipment is running and the corrective work identified by the PdM technology is scheduled concurrently with other high-value corrective tasks. PM inspections normally require the equipment to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: The P-F Curve, from John Moubray&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Reliability Centered Maintenance II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you can see, the most economical decision, and the one that makes the most technical sense, is to maintain the asset by using the following resources, in order, as they apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Process monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PdM technologies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time/meter based directed tasks (PM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aligning maintenance tasks to failures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Failures can be grouped into the following three categories. Understanding these categories is critical when assigning maintenance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Induced&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Intermittent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Wear out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Induced failures &lt;/strong&gt;are a result of an outside force causing the failure mode. For instance, a plant may run the production process in such a way that the assets are prematurely forced into a potential failure situation, or a soft foot condition on an equipment train causing coupling misalignment eventually leads to an inboard bearing failure. While process and PdM monitoring may help detect these potential failures (thereby eliminating an unscheduled stoppage), it is important to understand that induced failure must be recognized and analysis performed to determine the root cause. Only then are we acting proactively and making the transition into a Reliability-Based Maintenance organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent failures &lt;/strong&gt;can happen at any time. Some may actually use the term &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo;; however, the implication is that the mean time between failure (MTBF) cannot be determined. These differ from induced failure because they typically happen far enough up the P-F Curve that the repair can be effectively planned and scheduled. A plant can best detect these failure modes through process and PdM monitoring when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many plants also find that PMs are not effective in determining the onset of failure in either induced or intermittent failures and, therefore, a waste of capital. Too often, a plant may then choose to increase PM frequencies, or worse, write and schedule new procedures to attempt to mitigate these failures. This is what ultimately leads to an ineffective, costly and out-of-control maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wear-out failures &lt;/strong&gt;have a known MTBF and they occur when the useful life of a component is expended. These types of failure modes are often detectable through process and PdM monitoring. However, time-based refurbishment usually proves to be the most effective maintenance strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The definition of PM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A PM, by definition, is a repair/replace activity that will restore the functionality or useful life of an asset back to its original state. Other types of PM are failure-finding or condition evaluation tasks. A plant would deploy a failure-finding task when the consequences of failure or the risks associated with the failure are tolerable; these tasks are also helpful in finding hidden failures. One method of failure finding is to test-run standby plant equipment on some frequency to ensure it hasn&amp;rsquo;t failed while sitting idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition evaluation tasks are performed to determine a component&amp;rsquo;s failure rate. When organizations choose to perform condition evaluation tasks, it is with the understanding that condition evaluation is used to try to determine the MTBF. Correctly applied, it should be quantitative in nature. In other words, a precision measurement is taken and compared to established criteria that define when replacement is necessary. There are two principle reasons a plant would establish quantitative measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Craft skill differences are minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Wear rate trending. Where possible, warning or alert levels (yellow condition) and critical or action levels (red condition) should be defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A thorough understanding of potential failures of each piece of equipment can be developed through failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) to each equipment type in the plant. FMEA templates can be developed at a class/subclass/qualifier level (i.e. Pump/Centrifugal/Coupled or Pump/Centrifugal/Belt Driven). Significant time savings can be realized by developing templates. With each equipment type, a plant should be able to answer the seven basic RCM questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is its function?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the functional failures?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the failure modes?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the effects of those failures?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the consequences?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How can the failure be mitigated?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What if a suitable task cannot be found?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When answering Question 6, consider a logical path to utilize the three resources &amp;ndash; process monitoring, PdM monitoring, and PM, in that order &amp;ndash; as previously described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the FMEAs are completed, they can be applied at the asset level. This more granular review ties in the criticality ranking criteria to determine if the consequences of failure are great enough to perform the task. This is really an economic decision rule, &amp;ldquo;Is the cost of failure greater than the cost to mitigate?&amp;rdquo; This is extremely important to note since the goal of these programs is to reduce the cost of maintenance while maintaining high asset utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now a plant can define and communicate process parameters and rebuild and implement PdM routes. For example, a plant may employ: slow and high-speed vibration monitoring, electrical and mechanical thermography, motor circuit analysis, oil analysis, and NDT thickness testing. Existing PM tasks that cover the same failure modes that are now being defined with the PdM tasks can then be removed from the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a plant determines that a PM is the most effective way to mitigate failure, the worn component is replaced. For example, if a screw conveyor is shut down for a PM that addresses hanger bearings, the bearings would be replaced rather than inspected to determine if replacement is needed. This approach is often taken because the cost to shut down the line and the labor required to tear down the equipment for inspection is greater than the cost of a few hanger bearings. Once repairs are completed, the removed bearings could be inspected &amp;ldquo;at the bench&amp;rdquo; to help further define the MTBF and thereby &amp;ldquo;tweak&amp;rdquo; the task frequencies if warranted. This eliminates almost all condition evaluation type tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PM frequency is determined by work order history and craft knowledge. If there is a question about the MTBF, any given plant will choose the longer duration to set the PM frequency. Why should they choose the longer duration for failure rate? One might think this will cause some failure, but think of it this way: If every PM is entered conservatively and performed at a short and safe interval, it will take a long time to know if we right-sized the PM system. If each PM is set at an interval that to the best of our knowledge is the true interval, there will be a few mistakes made, but this will be evident relatively quickly. This may be an enormous leap for some plants. However, in order to make great strides in most reliability efforts, this will prove to be the correct method. If some frequencies are missed, they will be able to temporarily accept failure and improve over time. Success will hinge upon whether the frequencies appear to have been set appropriately and if unexpected failure does not increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This approach typically results in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		During the initial stages, maintenance costs will drop, and will continue to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Total maintenance staffing will decrease significantly compared with pre-project levels and will continue to decrease. This is usually realized through the elimination of contractors).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Significant return on the project investment (i.e. the first three months&amp;rsquo; performance paid back over half of the total project costs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Large shutdowns will be possible to enable the installation of new capital equipment while the OEE for the facility does not decline.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment is taken out of service far less frequently due to PMs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of predictive technologists increases as does the percentage of condition-monitored assets. Because of the depth of the condition monitoring coverage, continued monitoring ensures that the reliability of the plant is not compromised because of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many plants and managers identify tools and systems that claim to remedy the reliability ills of a facility. Implemented independently, the tools and systems are just added modules that increase costs without increasing plant reliability. True reliability is achieved when the most cost-effective methods are applied to the assets in the plant, thereby maximizing the maintenance effort with the minimum total cost to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Economy of force&amp;rdquo; is a military term used to describe the technique of using only the force necessary to defeat the enemy. In the reliability world, the enemy is downtime, labor, rework and materials costs. To compete globally, we must use the &amp;ldquo;economy of force&amp;rdquo; principle to ensure our plants run reliably at maximum output for minimum total costs. An integrated maintenance and reliability strategy is a key part of accomplishing this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How does a PM program help eliminate component failures?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In answering the question posed in the headline, we must first define what PM stands for. According to Life Cycle Engineering&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Rx_Definitions_60.html"&gt;Rx Definitions&lt;/a&gt;, this could have one of many meanings. It could refer to periodic maintenance, planned maintenance, predictive maintenance (although normally abbreviated as PdM) and preventive maintenance. Despite the definition of each and how they differ, they all relate to asset care. A properly cared-for asset will net much higher utilization at a much lower total cost of ownership. This is accomplished by establishing a program that mitigates or eliminates failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Periodic maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the cyclical maintenance actions or component replacements carried out at known regular intervals. Usually intrusive, they are often based on repair history and regulated by current inspection results. Periodic maintenance includes inspecting, testing, partial dismantling, replacing consumables or complete equipment items, lubricating, cleaning, and other work short of overhaul or renovation. This usually requires equipment to be scheduled out of service and may be done at intermediate intervals, usually ranging from monthly to annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is, by virtue of cost, importance, extensive labor and materials required, etc., planned to ensure, when scheduled, that it can be completed with the least interruption to operations and the most efficient use of maintenance resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Predictive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the use of instruments and analysis to determine equipment condition in order to predict failure before it takes place so corrective maintenance can be done in a planned and scheduled fashion. Examples include vibration analysis, oil analysis, thermography, airborne ultrasonics, non-destructive testing (NDT), motor current signature analysis, trending of process parameters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Preventive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is time- or cycle-based actions performed to prevent system functional failure. This proactive maintenance type generally includes scheduled restoration and scheduled discard tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure proper asset care, we must first understand our asset&amp;rsquo;s place in the functional hierarchy and its criticality relating to production process or value stream. This will also yield our lowest maintainable component. We now have the linkage to work orders, bills of material and reliability analytics. Once this is established, we then must understand the risk of the failures related to this component to determine the type of analysis we will use for developing our control plan to mitigate or eliminate these failures. This may direct us to a traditional Reliability-Centered Maintenance approach, a simplified failure modes and effects analysis, to follow the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommended maintenance, or to take no action since the component does not warrant any maintenance strategy due to a low risk ranking. In the event a hidden failure mode is identified for a critical component, a redesign would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once predominant failure modes are identified, controls must be put in place in the form of tasks. The preventive maintenance tasks must then be developed in the Task or Asset Activity module of the enterprise asset management (EAM) system so that a work order can be generated, planned and scheduled. In order to be effective, this task must meet the following: 1) based on a predominant failure mode, 2) comprehensive, 3) organized, 4) repeatable, 5) value-added, 6) proper interval, and 7) valid duration. There also should be a method to identify the skill level and acceptance criteria necessary to accomplish the task. Finally, a business process must exist to provide feedback on the condition of the component, actual duration to accomplish, and reliability analytics in place to validate all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Reliability engineering principles for the plant engineer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Increasingly, managers and engineers who are responsible for manufacturing and other industrial pursuits are incorporating a reliability focus into their strategic and tactical plans and initiatives. This trend is affecting numerous functional areas, including machine/system design and procurement, plant operations and plant maintenance. With its origins in the aviation industry, reliability engineering, as a discipline, has historically been focused primarily on assuring product reliability. More and more, these methods are being employed to assure the production reliability of manufacturing plants and equipment &amp;ndash; often as an enabler to lean manufacturing. This article provides an introduction to the most relevant and practical of these methods for plant reliability engineering, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Basic reliability calculations for failure rate, MTBF, availability, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An introduction to the exponential distribution &amp;ndash; the cornerstone of the reliability methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identifying failure time dependencies using the versatile Weibull system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Developing an effective field data collection system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The origins of the field of reliability engineering, at least the demand for it, can be traced back to the point at which man began to depend upon machines for his livelihood. The Noria, for instance, is an ancient pump thought to be the world&amp;rsquo;s first sophisticated machine. Utilizing hydraulic energy from the flow of a river or stream, the Noria utilized buckets to transfer water to troughs, viaducts and other distribution devices to irrigate fields and provide water to communities. If the community Noria failed, the people who depended upon it for their supply of food were at risk. Survival has always been a great source of motivation for reliability and dependability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the origins of its demand are ancient, reliability engineering as a technical discipline truly flourished along with the growth of commercial aviation following World War II. It became rapidly apparent to managers of aviation industry companies that crashes are bad for business. Karen Bernowski, editor of &lt;em&gt;Quality Progress&lt;/em&gt;, revealed in one of her editorials research into the media value of death by various means, which was conducted by MIT statistic professor Arnold Barnett and reported in 1994. Barnett evaluated the number of New York Times front-page news articles per 1,000 deaths by various means. He found that cancer-related deaths yielded 0.02 front-page news articles per 1,000 deaths, homicide yielded 1.7 per 1,000 deaths, AIDS yielded 2.3 per 1,000 deaths, and aviation-related accidents yielded a whopping 138.2 articles per 1,000 deaths!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cost and high-profile nature of aviation related accidents helped to motivate the aviation industry to participate heavily in the development of the reliability engineering discipline. Likewise, due to the critical nature of military equipment in defense, reliability engineering techniques have long been employed to assure operational readiness. Many of our standards in the reliability engineering field are MIL Standards or have their origins in military activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineering deals with the longevity and dependability of parts, products and systems. More poignantly, it is about controlling risk. Reliability engineering incorporates a wide variety of analytical techniques designed to help engineers understand the failure modes and patterns of these parts, products and systems. Traditionally, the reliability engineering field has focused upon product reliability and dependability assurance. In recent years, organizations that deploy machines and other physical assets in production settings have begun to deploy various reliability engineering principles for the purpose of production reliability and dependability assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increasingly, production organizations deploy reliability engineering techniques like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), including failure modes and effects (and criticality) analysis (FMEA,FMECA), root cause analysis (RCA), condition-based maintenance, improved work planning schemes, etc. These same organizations are beginning to adopt life cycle cost-based design and procurement strategies, change management schemes and other advanced tools and techniques in order to control the root causes of poor reliability. However, the adoption of the more quantitative aspects of reliability engineering by the production reliability assurance community has been slow. This is due in part to the perceived complexity of the techniques and in part due to the difficulty in obtaining useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quantitative aspects of reliability engineering may, on the surface, seem complicated and daunting. In reality, however, a relatively basic understanding of the most fundamental and widely applicable methods can enable the plant reliability engineer to gain a much clearer understanding about where problems are occurring, their nature and their impact on the production process &amp;ndash; at least in the quantitative sense. Used properly, quantitative reliability engineering tools and methods enable the plant reliability engineering to more effectively apply the frameworks provided by RCM, RCA, etc., by eliminating some of the guesswork involved with their application otherwise. However, engineers must be particularly clever in their application of the methods because the operating context and environment of a production process incorporates more variables than the somewhat one-dimensional world of product reliability assurance due to the combined influence of design engineering, procurement, production/operations, maintenance, etc., and the difficulty in creating effective tests and experiments to model the multidimensional aspects of a typical production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the increased difficulty in applying quantitative reliability methods in the production environment, it is nonetheless worthwhile to gain a sound understanding of the tools and apply them where appropriate. Quantitative data helps to define the nature and magnitude of a problem/opportunity, which provides vision to the reliability in his or her application of other reliability engineering tools. This article will provide an introduction to the most basic reliability engineering methods that are applicable to the plant engineer that is interested in production reliability assurance. It presupposes a basic understanding of algebra, probability theory and univariate statistics based upon the Gaussian (normal) distribution (e.g. measure of central tendency, measures of dispersion and variability, confidence intervals, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be made clear that this paper is a brief introduction to reliability methods. It is by no means a comprehensive survey of reliability engineering methods, nor is it in any way new or unconventional. The methods described herein are routinely used by reliability engineers and are core knowledge concepts for those pursuing professional certification by the American Society for Quality (ASQ) as a reliability engineer (CRE). Several books on reliability engineering are listed in the bibliography of this article. The author of this article has found &lt;em&gt;Reliability Methods for Engineers&lt;/em&gt; by K.S. Krishnamoorthi and &lt;em&gt;Reliability Statistics&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Dovich to be particularly useful and user-friendly references on the subject of reliability engineering methods. Both are published by the ASQ Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before discussing methods, you should familiarize yourself with reliability engineering nomenclature. For convenience, a highly abridged list of key terms and definitions is provided in the appendix of this article. For a more exhaustive definition of reliability terms and nomenclature, refer to MIL-STD-721 and other related standards. The definitions contained in the appendix are from MIL-STD-721.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic mathematical concepts in reliability engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many mathematical concepts apply to reliability engineering, particularly from the areas of probability and statistics. Likewise, many mathematical distributions can be used for various purposes, including the Gaussian (normal) distribution, the log-normal distribution, the Rayleigh distribution, the exponential distribution, the Weibull distribution and a host of others. For the purpose of this brief introduction, we&amp;rsquo;ll limit our discussion to the exponential distribution and the Weibull distribution, the two most widely applied to reliability engineering. In the interest of brevity and simplicity, important mathematical concepts such as distribution goodness-of-fit and confidence intervals have been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failure rate and mean time between/to failure (MTBF/MTTF)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The purpose for quantitative reliability measurements is to define the rate of failure relative to time and to model that failure rate in a mathematical distribution for the purpose of understanding the quantitative aspects of failure. The most basic building block is the failure rate, which is estimated using the following equation:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="26" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image002.gif" width="335" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;lambda; = Failure rate (sometimes referred to as the hazard rate)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;T &lt;/em&gt;= Total running time/cycles/miles/etc. during an investigation period for both failed and non-failed items.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;r &lt;/em&gt;= The total number of failures occurring during the investigation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if five electric motors operate for a collective total time of 50 years with five functional failures during the period, the failure rate is 0.1 failures per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another very basic concept is the mean time between/to failure (MTBF/MTTF). The only difference between MTBF and MTTF is that we employ MTBF when referring to items that are repaired when they fail. For items that are simply thrown away and replaced, we use the term MTTF. The computations are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic calculation to estimate mean time between failure (MTBF) and mean time to failure (MTTF), both measures of central tendency, is simply the reciprocal of the failure rate function. It is calculated using the following equation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="26" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image004.gif" width="335" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;theta; = Mean time between/to failure&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;T &lt;/em&gt;= Total running time/cycles/miles/etc. during an investigation period for both failed and non-failed items.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;r &lt;/em&gt;= The total number of failures occurring during the investigation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The MTBF for our industrial electric motor example is 10 years, which is the reciprocal of the failure rate for the motors. Incidentally, we would estimate MTBF for electric motors that are rebuilt upon failure. For smaller motors that are considered disposable, we would state the measure of central tendency as MTTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The failure rate is a basic component of many more complex reliability calculations. Depending upon the mechanical/electrical design, operating context, environment and/or maintenance effectiveness, a machine&amp;rsquo;s failure rate as a function of time may decline, remain constant, increase linearly or increase geometrically (Figure 1). The importance of failure rate vs. time will be discussed in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="381" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image006.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Different Failure Rates vs. Time Scenarios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Bathtub&amp;rsquo; Curve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Individuals that have received only basic training in probability and statistics are probably most familiar with the Gaussian or normal distribution, which is associated with familiar bell-shaped probability density curve. The Gaussian distribution is generally applicable to data sets where the two most common measures of central tendency, mean and median, are approximately equal. Surprisingly, despite the versatility of the Gaussian distribution in modeling probabilities for phenomenon ranging from standardized test scores to the birth weights of babies, it is not the dominant distribution employed in reliability engineering. The Gaussian distribution has its place in evaluating the failure characteristics of machines with a dominant failure mode, but the primary distribution employed in reliability engineering is the exponential distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When evaluating the reliability and failure characteristics of a machine, we must begin with the much-maligned &amp;ldquo;bathtub&amp;rdquo; curve, which reflects the failure rate vs. time (Figure 2). In concept, the bathtub curve effectively demonstrates a machine&amp;rsquo;s three basic failure rate characteristics: declining, constant or increasing. Regrettably, the bathtub curve has been harshly criticized in the maintenance engineering literature because it fails to effectively model the characteristic failure rate for most machines in an industrial plant, which is generally true at the macro level. Most machines spend their lives in the early life, or infant mortality, and/or the constant failure rate regions of the bathtub curve. We rarely see systemic time-based failures in industrial machines. Despite its limitations in modeling the failure rates of typical industrial machines, the bathtub curve is a useful tool for explaining the basic concepts of reliability engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="230" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image008.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. The Much-maligned &amp;lsquo;Bathtub&amp;rsquo; Curve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The human body is an excellent example of a system that follows the bathtub curve. People, and other organic species for that matter, tend to suffer a high failure rate (mortality) during their first years of life, particularly the first few years, but the rate decreases as the child grows older. Assuming a person reaches puberty and survives his or her teenage years, his or her mortality rate becomes fairly constant and remains there until age (time) dependent illnesses begin to increase the mortality rate (wearout). Numerous influences affect mortality rates, including prenatal care and mother&amp;rsquo;s nutrition, quality and availability of medical care, environment and nutrition, lifestyle choices and, of course, genetic predisposition. These factors can be metaphorically compared to factors that influence machine life. Design and procurement is analogous to genetic predisposition; installation and commissioning is analogous to prenatal care and mother&amp;rsquo;s nutrition; and lifestyle choices and availability of medical care is analogous to maintenance effectiveness and proactive control over operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The exponential distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The exponential distribution, the most basic and widely used reliability prediction formula, models machines with the constant failure rate, or the flat section of the bathtub curve. Most industrial machines spend most of their lives in the constant failure rate, so it is widely applicable. Below is the basic equation for estimating the reliability of a machine that follows the exponential distribution, where the failure rate is constant as a function of time.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="36" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image010.gif" width="335" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	R(t) = Reliability estimate for a period of time, cycles, miles, etc. (t).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;= Base of the natural logarithms (2.718281828)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;lambda; = Failure rate (1/MTBF, or 1/MTTF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our electric motor example, if you assume a constant failure rate the likelihood of running a motor for six years without a failure, or the projected reliability, is 55 percent. This is calculated as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
	R(6) = 2.718281828-(0.1* 6)&lt;br /&gt;
	R(6) = 0.5488 = ~ 55%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, after six years, about 45% of the population of identical motors operating in an identical application can probabilistically be expected to fail. It is worth reiterating at this point that these calculations project the probability for a population. Any given individual from the population could fail on the first day of operation while another individual could last 30 years. That is the nature of probabilistic reliability projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A characteristic of the exponential distribution is the MTBF occurs at the point at which the calculated reliability is 36.78%, or the point at which 63.22% of the machines have already failed. In our motor example, after 10 years, 63.22% of the motors from a population of identical motors serving in identical applications can be expected to fail. In other words, the survival rate is 36.78% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We often speak of projected bearing life as the L10 life. This is the point in time at which 10% of a population of bearings should be expected to fail (90% survival rate). In reality, only a fraction of the bearings actually survive to the L10 point. We&amp;rsquo;ve come to accept that as the objective life for a bearing when perhaps we should set our sights on the L63.22 point, indicating that our bearings are lasting, on average, to projected MTBF &amp;ndash; assuming, of course, that the bearings follow the exponential distribution. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss that issue later in the Weibull analysis section of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The probability density function (pdf), or life distribution, is a mathematical equation that approximates the failure frequency distribution. It is the pdf, or life frequency distribution, that yields the familiar bell-shaped curve in the Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Below is the pdf for the exponential distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img height="30" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image012.gif" width="335" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	pdf(t) =Life frequency distribution for a given time (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;= Base of the natural logarithms (2.718281828)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;lambda; = Failure rate (1/MTBF, or 1/MTTF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our electric motor example, the actual likelihood of failure at three years is calculated as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;pdf(3) &lt;/em&gt;= 01. * 2.718281828-(0.1* 3)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;pdf(3) &lt;/em&gt;= 0.1 * 0.7408&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;pdf(3) &lt;/em&gt;= .07408 = ~ 7.4%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our example, if we assume a constant failure rate, which follows the exponential distribution, the life distribution, or pdf for the industrial electric motors, is expressed in Figure 3. Don&amp;rsquo;t be confused by the declining nature of the pdf function. Yes, the failure rate is constant, but the pdf mathematically assumes failure without replacement, so the population from which failures can occur is continuously reducing &amp;ndash; asymptotically approaching zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="263" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image014.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. The Probability Density Function (pdf)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The cumulative distribution function (cdf) is simply the cumulative number of failures one might expect over a period of time. For the exponential distribution, the failure rate is constant, so the relative rate at which failed components are added to the cdf remains constant. However, as the population declines as a result of failure, the actual number of mathematically estimated failures decreases as a function of the declining population. Much like the pdf asymptotically approaches zero, the cdf asymptotically approaches one (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="224" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image016.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Failure Rate and the Cumulative Distribution Function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The declining failure rate portion of the bathtub curve, which is often called the infant mortality region, and the wear out region will be discussed in the following section addressing the versatile Weibull distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weibull Distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Originally developed by Wallodi Weibull, a Swedish mathematician, Weibull analysis is easily the most versatile distribution employed by reliability engineers. While it is called a distribution, it is actually a tool that enables the reliability engineer to first characterize the probability density function (failure frequency distribution) of a set of failure data to characterize the failures as early life, constant (exponential) or wear out (Gaussian or log normal) by plotting time to failure data on a special plotting paper with the log of the times/cycles/miles to failure plotted a log scaled X-axis versus the cumulative percent of the population represented by each failure on a log-log scaled Y-axis (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="281" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image018.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. The Simple Weibull Plot &amp;ndash; Annotated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once plotted, the linear slope of the resultant curve is an important variable, called the shape parameter, represented by &amp;acirc;, which is used to adjust the exponential distribution to fit a wide number of failure distributions. In general, if the &amp;acirc; coefficient, or shape parameter, is less than 1.0, the distribution exhibits early life, or infant mortality failures. If the shape parameter exceeds about 3.5, the data are time dependent and indicate wearout failures. This data set typically assumes the Gaussian, or normal, distribution. As the &amp;acirc; coefficient increases above ~ 3.5, the bell-shaped distribution tightens, exhibiting increasing kurtosis (peakedness at the top of the curve) and a smaller standard deviation. Many data sets will exhibit two or even three distinct regions. It is common for reliability engineers to plot, for example, one curve representing the shape parameter during run in and another curve to represent the constant or gradually increasing failure rate. In some instances, a third distinct linear slope emerges to identify a third shape, the wearout region. In these instances, the pdf of the failure data do in fact assume the familiar bathtub curve shape (Figure 6). Most mechanical equipment used in plants, however, exhibit an infant mortality region and a constant or gradually increasing failure rate region. It is rare to see a curve representing wearout emerge. The characteristic life, or &amp;eta; (lower case Greek &amp;ldquo;Eta&amp;rdquo;), is the Weibull approximation of the MTBF. It is always the function of time, miles or cycles where 63.21% of the units under evaluation have failed, which is the MTBF/MTTF for the exponential distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="212" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image020.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. Depending upon the shape parameter, the Weibull failure density curve can assume several distributions, which is what makes it so versatile for reliability engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a caveat to tie this tool back to excellence in maintenance and operations excellence, if we were to more effectively control the forcing functions that lead to mechanical failure in bearings, gears, etc., such as lubrication, contamination control, alignment, balance, appropriate operation, etc., more machines would actually reach their fatigue life. Machines that reach their fatigue life will exhibit the familiar wearout characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using the &amp;beta; coefficient to adjust the failure rate equation as a function of time yields the following general equation:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="57" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image022.gif" width="338" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;h(t) &lt;/em&gt;= Failure rate (or hazard rate) for a given time (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;= Base of the natural logarithms (2.718281828)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;theta; = Estimated MTBF/MTTF&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;beta; = Weibull shape parameter from plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And, the following reliability function:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="57" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image024.gif" width="332" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;R(t) &lt;/em&gt;=Reliability estimate for a period of time, cycles, miles, etc. (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;= Base of the natural logarithms (2.718281828)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;theta; = Estimated MTBF/MTTF&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;beta; = Weibull shape parameter from plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And, the following probability density function (pdf):&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="53" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image026.gif" width="332" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;pdf(t) &lt;/em&gt;=Probability density function estimate for a period of time,&lt;br /&gt;
	cycles, miles, etc. (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;e &lt;/em&gt;= Base of the natural logarithms (2.718281828)&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;theta; = Estimated MTBF/MTTF&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;beta; = Weibull shape parameter from plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that when the &amp;beta; equals 1.0, the Weibull distribution takes the form of the exponential distribution on which it is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To the uninitiated, the mathematics required to perform Weibull analysis may look daunting. But once you understand the mechanics of the formulas, the math is really quite simple. Moreover, software will do most of the work for us today, but it is important to have an understanding of the underlying theory so that the plant reliability engineer can effectively deploy the powerful Weibull analysis technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our previously discussed example of electric motors, we previously assumed the exponential distribution. However, if Weibull analysis revealed early life failures by yielding a &amp;beta; shape parameter of 0.5, the estimate of reliability at six years time would be ~46%, not the ~55% estimated assuming the exponential distribution. In order to reduce wearout failures, we would need to lean on our suppliers to provide better-built and delivered quality and reliability, store the motors better to avoid rust, corrosion, fretting and other static wear mechanisms, and do a better job of installing and starting up new or rebuilt machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, if Weibull analysis revealed that the motors exhibited predominantly wearout-related failures, yielding a &amp;beta; shape parameter of 5.0, the estimate of reliability at six years time would be ~ 93%, instead of the ~55% estimated assuming the exponential distribution. For time-dependent wearout failures, we can perform scheduled overhaul or replacement assuming we have a good estimate of the MTBF/MTTF after we&amp;rsquo;ve reached the wearout region and a sufficiently small standard deviation so as to make high confidence rebuild/replace decisions that aren&amp;rsquo;t exceedingly costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our motor example, assuming a &amp;beta; shape parameter of 5.0, the failure rate begins to rapidly increase after about five or six years, so we may want to edit our data to just focus upon the wearout region when estimating time-based replacement or rebuild time. Alternatively, we can improve the design, targeting the dominant failure mode(s) with the objective of decreasing &amp;ldquo;stress-strength&amp;rdquo; interferences. In other words, we can attempt to eliminate the machine&amp;rsquo;s frailties through design modification, the goal being to eliminate whatever is causing the time-dependent failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assuming everything is constant, except the &amp;beta; shape parameter, Figure 7 illustrates the difference the &amp;beta; shape parameter has on the estimate of reliability assuming &amp;beta; shape values of 0.5 (early life), 1.0 (constant, or exponential) and 5.0 (wearout) for a range of time estimates. This graphic visually illustrates the concept of increasing risk vs. time (&amp;beta; = 0.5), constant risk vs. time (&amp;beta; = 1.0) and increasing risk vs. time (&amp;beta; = 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Multi-Slope Weibull Plot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Frequently, when drawing a best-fit regression line through the data points on a Weibull plot, the coefficient of correlation is poor, meaning the actual data points stray a great distance from regression line. This is assessed by examining the coefficient of correlation R, or more conservatively, R2, which denotes data variability. When correlation is poor, the reliability engineer should examine the data to evaluate if two or more patterns exist, which can denote major differences in failure modes, operating context, etc. Often, this produces two or more estimates of beta (Figure 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="277" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image030.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8. An Example of a Multi-beta Weibull Plot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we see in our example in Figure 8, the data set works better when two distinct regression lines are drawn. The first line, exhibits a beta shape parameter of 0.5, suggesting early life failures. The second line exhibits a beta shape of 3.0, suggesting that the risk of failure increases as a function of time. It is common for complex equipment, particularly mechanical equipment, to experience &amp;ldquo;run-in&amp;rdquo; failures when new or recently rebuilt. As such, the risk of failure is highest just following initial start-up. Once the system works through its run-in period, which can take minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years, depending upon the system type, the system enters a different risk pattern. In this example, the system enters a period where the risk of failure increases as a function of time once the system exits its run-in period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The multi-beta offers the reliability engineer a more precise estimate of risk as a function of time. Armed with this knowledge, he or she is better positioned to take mitigating actions. For example, during the early life period, we&amp;rsquo;d be inclined to improve the precision with which we manufacture/rebuild, install and start-up. Moreover, we might add monitoring techniques and/or increase our monitoring frequency during the high risk period. Following the run-in period, we might introduce monitoring techniques that are targeted at the time-dependent wearout failures that are believed to affect the system, increase monitoring frequency accordingly or schedule &amp;ldquo;hard-time&amp;rdquo; preventive maintenance actions in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estimating System Reliability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once the reliability of components or machines has been established relative to the operating context and required mission time, plant engineers must assess the reliability of a system or process. Again, for the sake of brevity and simplicity, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss system reliability estimates for series, parallel and shared-load redundant system (r/n systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Series Systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Before discussing series systems, we should discuss reliability block diagrams. Not a complicated tool to use, reliability block diagrams simply map a process from start to finish. For a series system, Subsystem A is followed by Subsystem B and so forth. In the series system, the ability to employ Subsystem B depends upon the operating state of Subsystem A. If Subsystem A is not operating, the system is down regardless of the condition of Subsystem B (Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To calculate the system reliability for a serial process, you only need to multiply the estimated reliability of Subsystem A at time (t) by the estimated reliability of Subsystem B at time (t). The basic equation for calculating the system reliability of a simple series system is:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="26" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image032.gif" width="332" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Rs(t) &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; System reliability for given time (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;R1-n(t) &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; Subsystem or sub-function reliability for given time (t)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, for a simple system with three subsystems, or sub-functions, each having an estimated reliability of 0.90 (90%) at time (t), the system reliability is calculated as 0.90 X 0.90 X 0.90 = 0.729, or about 73%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="147" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image034.gif" width="405" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9. Simple Serial System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parallel Systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Often, design engineers will incorporate redundancy into critical machines. Reliability engineers call these parallel systems. These systems may be designed as active parallel systems or standby parallel systems. The block diagram for a simple two component parallel system is shown in Figure 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="152" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image036.gif" width="405" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 10. Simple parallel system &amp;ndash; the system reliability is increased to 99% due to the redundancy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To calculate the reliability of an active parallel system, where both machines are running, use the following simple equation:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="36" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image038.gif" width="325" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Rs(t) &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; System reliability for given time (t)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;R1-n(t) &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; Subsystem or sub-function reliability for given time (t)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The simple parallel system in our example with two components in parallel, each having a reliability of 0.90, has a total system reliability of 1 &amp;ndash; (0.1 X 0.1) = 0.99. So, the system reliability was significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are some shortcut methods for calculating parallel system reliability when all subsystems have the same estimated reliability. More often, systems contain parallel and serial subcomponents as depicted in Figure 11. The calculation of standby systems requires knowledge about the reliability of the switching mechanism. In the interest of simplicity and brevity, this topic will be reserved for a future article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="147" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image040.gif" width="405" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 11. Combination System with Parallel and Serial Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;r out of n Systems (r/n Systems)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	An important concept to plant reliability engineers is the concept of r/n systems. These systems require that r units from a total population in n be available for use. A great industrial example is coal pulverizers in an electric power generating plant. Often, the engineers design this function in the plant using an r/n approach. For instance, a unit has four pulverizers and the unit requires that three of the four be operable to run at the unit&amp;rsquo;s full load (see Figure 12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="337" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image042.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 12. Simple r/n system example &amp;ndash; Three of the four components are required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reliability calculation for an r/n system can be reduced to a simple cumulative binomial distribution calculation, the formula for which is:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img height="55" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_070909drew_clip_image044.gif" width="332" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Rs &lt;/em&gt;= System reliability given the actual number of failures (r) is less than or equal the maximum allowable (k)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;r &lt;/em&gt;= The actual number of failures&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;k &lt;/em&gt;= The maximum allowable number of failures&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= The total number of units in the system&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;= The probability of survival, or the subcomponent reliability for a given time (t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This equation is somewhat more complicated. In our pulverizer example, assuming a subcomponent reliability of 0.90, the equation works out as a summation of the following:&lt;br /&gt;
	P(0) = 0.6561&lt;br /&gt;
	P(1) = 0.2916&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, the likelihood of completing the mission time (t) is 0.9477 (0.6561 + 0.2916), or approximately 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Field Data Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To employ the reliability analysis methods described herein, the engineer requires data. It is imperative to establish field data collection systems to support your reliability management initiatives. Likewise, as much as possible, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to employ common nomenclature and units so that your data can be parsed effectively for more detailed analysis. Collect the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Basic System Information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operating Context&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Environmental Context&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good general system for data collection is described in the IEC standard 300-3-2. In addition to providing instructions for collecting field data, it provides a standard taxonomy of failure modes. Other taxonomies have been established, but the IEC standard represents a good starting point for your organization to define its own. Likewise, DOE standard NE-1004-92 offers a very nice standard nomenclature of failure causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An important benefit derived from your efforts to collect good field data is that it enables you to break the &amp;ldquo;random trap.&amp;rdquo; As I mentioned earlier, the bathtub curve has been much maligned &amp;ndash; particularly in the Reliability-Centered Maintenance literature. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that Weibull analysis reveals that few complex mechanical systems exhibit time-dependent wearout failures, the reason, at least in part, is due to the fact that the reliability of complex systems is affected by a wide variety of failure modes and mechanisms. When these are lumped together, there is a &amp;ldquo;randomizing&amp;rdquo; effect, which makes the failures appear to lack any time dependency. However, if the failure modes were analyzed individually, the story would likely be very different (Figure 13). For certain, some failure modes would still be mathematically random, but many, and arguably most, would exhibit a time dependency. This kind of information would arm reliability engineers and managers with a powerful set of options for mitigating failure risk with a high degree of precision. Naturally, this ability depends upon the effective collection and subsequent analysis of field data.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This brief introduction to reliability engineering methods is intended to expose the otherwise uninitiated plant engineer to the world of quantitative reliability engineering. The subject is quite broad, however, and I&amp;rsquo;ve only touched on the major reliability methods that I believe are most applicable to the plant engineer. I encourage you to further investigate the field of reliability engineering methods, concentrating on the following topics, among others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More detailed understanding of the Weibull distribution and its applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More detailed understanding of the exponential distribution and its applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The Gaussian distribution and its applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The log-normal distribution and its applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Confidence intervals (binomial, chi-square/Poisson, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Beta distribution and its applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bayesian applications of reliability engineering methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stress-strength interference analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Testing options and their applicability to plant reliability engineering&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reliability growth strategies and management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More detailed understanding of field data collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most important, spend time learning how to apply reliability engineering methods to plant reliability problems. If your interest in reliability engineering methods is high, I encourage you to pursue professional certification by the American Society for Quality as a reliability engineer (CRE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failure mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The physical, chemical, electrical, thermal or other process which results in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failure mode&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The consequence of the mechanism through which the failure occurs, i.e. short, open, fracture, excessive wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failure, random&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Failure whose occurrence is predictable only in the probabilistic or statistical sense. This applies to all distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failure rate&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The total number of failures within an item population, divided by the total number of life units expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Maintainability&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The measure of the ability of an item to be retained or restored to specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel having specified skill levels, using prescribed procedures and resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

(2) The probability that an item can perform its intended function for a specified interval under stated conditions. For non-redundant items this is the equivalent to definition (1). For redundant items, this is the definition of mission reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/fch7v_4oDKA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>TPM with RCM forms a powerful combination</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Two complementary philosophies form a powerful combination to change the organizational culture and establish a process for continuous improvement. The Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) approach, based on people and process, transforms culture and the way we view our assets. The Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) approach can be daunting, although it establishes a strong foundation for a maintenance strategy. Individually, both have been monumental approaches to maintenance excellence, but when combined have been proven to reduce downtime and increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has made a decision to change the way it view its assets. Our assets &amp;ndash; like yours &amp;ndash; are invaluable. Could it be as simple as to make a decision to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle3"&gt;Complementary Philosophies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By supporting the TPM process, in particular the Planned Maintenance &amp;amp; Autonomous Maintenance pillars, the RCM methodology will further solidify the maintenance management foundation and facilitate continuous improvement. You can conclusively gain a maintenance program based on the organization&amp;rsquo;s overall business goals. What we all must first understand is that before anyone goes anywhere (i.e. &amp;ldquo;world-class&amp;rdquo; production and maintenance) or does anything (i.e. &amp;ldquo;working smarter instead of harder&amp;rdquo;) &amp;ndash; a decision has to be made on all levels of the organization to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF learned this first-hand from one of our Automotive Division factories in South America. In a highly competitive market, this factory found it difficult to gain the competitive advantage with traditional behavior concerning production and maintenance. When faced with closure looming in the years ahead, they decided to make a change. In order to stay open and nobly save many jobs in the process, this factory chose TPM as the catalyst to change. Sometime later, SKF had adopted this philosophy as one of their ways to build a foundation for World-Class Manufacturing Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since adopting TPM, SKF began to realize the missing ingredient, reliability thinking. The adaptation was first thought to be RCM, but it was later found to be more adept to use the SKF SRCM process. Why? RCM is particularly useful and feasible for maintenance of identical installations (like aircraft), but given the operational context and the maintainability of our assets, it was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another issue was that a certain level of maintenance maturity is required to ensure accurate and complete asset data. It was difficult to gauge and to ensure that everyone would be at equivalent levels. Based on irregularity of assets and irresolute maintenance maturity, SKF chose SKF SRCM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF SRCM is a maintenance strategy review process that provides virtually the same results as classical RCM, but uses an efficient process to define needs and focus appropriate efforts on critical and non-critical equipment, functions and systems. Both TPM and SKF SRCM have been integrated, and the Planned Maintenance Pillar of TPM has been since redesigned. The impacts not only affect the Planned Maintenance pillar, but have a cascading effect on all pillars that SKF has chosen to implement. The chosen pillars, in no particular order, are Focused Improvement, Training and Education, Planned Maintenance, and Autonomous Maintenance with a foundation of 5-S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle3"&gt;Total Productive Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	TPM, a Japanese philosophy used in many facets of industry, seeks to increase productivity by eliminating any waste of effort. TPM is attractive to many different industries but has proved well in line and batch manufacturing. The idea began in 1951 when preventive maintenance was introduced to Japan from the USA. Nippondenso, part of Toyota, was the first company in Japan to introduce plant-wide preventive maintenance in 1960.(5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some realizations were made, the workload was too much for maintenance alone. A shared maintenance relationship between operators and maintenance was implemented called planned and autonomous maintenance. This has since grown into the eight pillars we commonly know today as Kobetsu Kaizen, Autonomous Maintenance, Planned Maintenance, Training and Education, Early Equipment Management, Safety Hygiene &amp;amp; the Environment, Quality Maintenance, and TPM in the Office. Many different organizations alter TPM and make it unique to their company&amp;rsquo;s philosophies; however, the concept and inner progressions remain mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle3"&gt;Reliability-Centered Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	RCM can be briefly explained as a structured process, originally developed in the airline industry, to determine the equipment maintenance strategies required for any physical asset to ensure that it continues to fulfill its intended functions in its present operating context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The assets are decomposed, extensively analyzed and described, failure modes and effects analyses (FMEA) are made for the most critical components, and the maintenance organization and processes are carefully (re)defined.(1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make an austere statement, RCM was derived from a process to help keep airplanes from falling out of the sky and to make nuclear power plants from being the next Chernobyl-like disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RCM was developed in the U.S. commercial aviation industry in the late 1960s. RCM was then adopted by U.S. Department of Defense in 1970s. RCM was identified by the USA Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in 1984 as a candidate for application to nuclear power plants. Furthermore, three pilot applications were sponsored by EPRI from 1985 to 1987; they all were single-system studies that were initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To further clarify what RCM is and is not, a standard from the Society of Automotive Engineers was developed known as SAE JA10112 and can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.SAE.org"&gt;www.SAE.org&lt;/a&gt;. This standard provides an evaluation criterion to eliminate any questions of whether or not the so-called RCM process is true to its roots to ensure that the asset continues to fulfill its intended functions in its present operating context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seven criteria simplified are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the functions and operating context?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How can it fail to achieve these functions?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What makes a functions failure become true?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the result of this true failure?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is outcome of the result and its defined significance?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What must be done to eliminate failure?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What must be done if failure cannot be eliminated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle3"&gt;First Steps First&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF decided to make a change and chose a vehicle. We then altered that vehicle to meet our needs and address the culture. Simple TPM and SKF SRCM were the sponsored methods. These two methods when combined would only be the starting point for World-Class Manufacturing Excellence. Many other areas such as Six Sigma, energy efficiency, etc., need to be sprinkled in and they all have to be well balanced with one another. Proprietary reasons restrict some content of how, but if focusing only on the Planned Maintenance pillar of TPM, the main points can be highlighted and conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This change was not only needed on the manufacturing floor, but by the management team as well. SKF needed to open its eyes to see in a different way. Benchmarking was the first key metric. Gauging our performance against other manufacturing industries across the globe was vital. SKF did have pockets of &amp;ldquo;best practices&amp;rdquo; internally, but it would be more powerful to compare external organizations. It would assist in driving home the need for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle3"&gt;Five Key Ways SKF Improved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Visiting companies like Bosch, Tetra Pak, Fiat and Unilever (among others) gave a foundation to create a gap analysis to accurately measure our current situation when compared to SKF&amp;rsquo;s vision. The gap analysis as well as the SKF Client Needs Analysis (CNA) are the tools that are used. SKF needed to measure production and maintenance maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These tools are easy enough to relay information between the individual manufacturing facilities around the world to a centralized location. The gap analyses and the CNA are an ongoing effort that is usually carried out on a yearly frequency to check progress and address weak areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizational structure was very much needed. Why? In a global organization, it is impractical to have a small or large group located centrally to make global change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It took some time to configure the most appropriate organizational structure. There typically is no right or wrong way, but there certainly are by-products from poor organizational structure. A bottom-up approach was the preferred way. SKF has found that it constantly must change in order to address new issues and promote continuous improvements. The diagram below depicts the bottom-up approach and where support was aligned for continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="237" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_TPM_Chart1.gif" width="402" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Top-down approach for organizational structure&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consultancy is a key area that continues to make a difference. When SKF does not have the resources or internal availability, it must be supplemented. We have called on TPM consultants, as well as other content experts, to provide assistance to SKF in order to transform globally. Due to the nature of consultants, their deliverables match precisely with what the needs are of the organization. Good quality consultants are a must for SKF to better understand its current situation and to gain competitive advantage over where the opposition is headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Business Process Management (BPM) is something that has emerged recently in the context of BPM systems. BPM systems allow management and engineers alike to analyze and measure effectiveness of business processes. Using a rudimentary BPM system, SKF&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Division and Service Division joined forces and overlaid Asset Efficiency Optimization (AEO) using the SKF SRCM process and the Planned Maintenance pillar of TPM. Six fundamental characteristics were identified in the context of planned maintenance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate the current stage (KPIs and business goal alignment)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair assets and improve weak points&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organize the Computer Maintenance Management System (CMMS)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop maintenance strategy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement maintenance strategy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate and sustain maintenance strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final key area that SKF was able to exploit is how and when to use what technologies and techniques. SKF Asset Management Services works closely to prescribe the right medicine for an accurate diagnosis. This is, of course, in the context of maintenance management. It is well proven to gain a quick win is just that &amp;ndash; a quick, short win. Part of the decision-making process, as discussed in the&lt;br /&gt;
	Complementary Philosophies section of this paper, is to decide whether sustained improvements over time is appropriate or if it&amp;rsquo;s more astute to get some quick wins in order to gain momentum. SKF chose sustained improvements over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, it is quite simple to decide to do anything. Following through and continuously improving is what most fail to do. Establishing systems and processes and putting them in place matter most for continuous improvement. Could it be as simple as to make a decision to change? The answer, in my opinion, is no; it is what the content is and what we do. It&amp;rsquo;s not what we merely talk about, but rather actions. This is what is needed in order to achieve the overall vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF continues to experience results such as reduced downtime, improved throughput, increased efficiency and employee satisfaction due to this decision. Moreover, the choice is yours to make. What will you decide?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Putting a modern spin on FMEA</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Long a mainstay tool used to enhance the reliability of product designs, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) can also serve a valuable purpose for the manufacturing and process reliability engineer &amp;hellip; if we make a few modifications. The standard FMEA process, which is detailed in IEC Standard 60812 and elsewhere, works pretty well as it is, but it can be improved. Here are some key points for updating your FMEA process to get it working for you in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200805_Exponent-Figure1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Figure 1. A more modern form of the FMEA to serve industrial plants and operations. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Begin the process by creating functional block diagrams (FBD) for the production processes under review. An FBD is just like a reliability block diagram (RBD) but without the numbers. We typically lack quantifiable reliability performance data at this stage of the game. Once we have it, we&amp;#39;ll fill in the blocks to create RBDs. It&amp;#39;s usually best to break the plant down into blocks. The functional block diagrams form the functions that will be reviewed in the FMEA process, so be detailed - these are the functions upon which your plant relies to complete the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take the guesswork out of the process. Begin by collecting data using a systematic failure reporting and corrective action system (FRACAS) process. Usually, within three to six months, you&amp;#39;ll see 80 to 90 percent of what goes wrong in your plant. After that time, you can scale back or simplify the data collection process if you wish; but prior to completing your FMEAs, you need plenty of detail about what&amp;#39;s really happening. The human memory is fragile and fallible; data is the difference between deciding and guessing. Before undertaking the data collection process, standardize your taxonomies of failure modes and failure causes. This will make the data much more manageable when it comes time to carry out the FMEA process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Forget about the dimensionless risk priority number (RPN). Quantify your losses in terms of Cost per Event x Number of Events per Year. This yields a monetized effect on the organization in annualized terms. Costs might include repair costs, downtime costs, risk-based costs, energy costs, etc. You may have to spend money to mitigate the targeted loss. To do so, you need a cost benefit analysis, so the risk must be monetized at some point; you may as well do it in the FMEA process. When it comes to getting improvement initiatives approved, dollars talk ... everything else walks. Get ahead of the game and monetize your risks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the possible contributing causes using a standardized taxonomy of failure causes, and check all that apply. It is rare that complex failures have a single cause. The event is usually brought about by the combined effect of several contributing causes. Carry that information over from FRACAS to FMEA.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Capture and categorize your action decision. In all instances, you must decide to act to resolve the problem, choose not to act or schedule a root cause analysis (RCA) event to explore the problem further. The decision to act is often based upon the cost benefit analysis. If you choose not to act, record your reason why and periodically review to see if the landscape has changed. Sometimes, new technology comes around that will enable you to manage a risk more cost-effectively, or the impact of a risk becomes more poignant to the organization due to market changes or changes in the operating context.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		f you choose to act, clearly define what mitigating actions are required. Associated with those actions are implementation costs, both up-front and ongoing, and a new estimate of the annualized failure cost. Changes in design, procedures, etc., will serve to either: a) reduce the cost per event, and/or b) reduce the number of events per year. In all cases, the action should reduce the annualized failure cost. Capture that projected new failure cost information on the FMEA sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In order to go forward with any improvement project, you must have a positive return on investment (ROI). Since you&amp;#39;ve captured your current annualized failure costs, your projected annualized failure costs and your estimated costs to mitigate the risks with corrective actions, you have everything you need to create a five- or seven-year cash flow projection. By applying your company&amp;#39;s cost of capital, you can tabulate the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and discounted payback period (DPP). If the numbers look good, go with it. If the proposed change fails to provide an acceptable return, shelve the project, but schedule a re-review to determine if changes in the market or the organization&amp;#39;s operating context alters the ROI calculation, and to evaluate if a new, lower-cost solution to the problem is available.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assign the corrective action to an individual or team and define a due-by date. A due-by date converts a wish into a goal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Trend actual-to-projected costs to implement and returns to the organization. If the returns are greater than projected, turn up the steam to deploy the change into other plants or lines where it is applicable. If the returns are less than you projected, retool the correction or slow/stop further deployment to other plants or lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make the FMEA process a living document, a monetized diary of your risk management activities. When you conduct an RCA, capture the results in your FMEA database. The traditional approach specified by the FMEA standard is still valid. We just need to modify it a little for use in industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To summarize our key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Start with data collection. Data is the difference between deciding and guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dollarize your findings. You&amp;#39;re spending money to correct problems; your benefits must outweigh the expense.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			While FMEA is used extensively in Reliability-Centered Maintenance, don&amp;#39;t limit its application to maintenance in the plant. Your problems are cross-functional. Your solutions should also be cross-functional!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Fresh approach to RCM is needed</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic method of developing an optimized maintenance policy for a physical asset. Born from the aviation industry, where it is very effective, RCM has gained popularity within the manufacturing and process industries. While some have succeeded in deploying it, many others have been disappointed or become frustrated with the tedious process and given up altogether. I believe we need a fresh approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;#39;ve read my previous Exponent columns or attended my workshops, you&amp;#39;re aware of my preference for a more holistic approach to plant reliability management. For example, I&amp;#39;ve targeted the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) metric, proposing instead a more encompassing view - overall business effectiveness (OBE). Unavailability and quality and yield losses can result from equipment issues (such as scheduled and unscheduled downtime), production issues (product changeovers or supply chain disruptions) and/or marketing issues (low demand or overselling the plant&amp;#39;s capabilities). OBE better reflects the true nature of the business and enables managers to target waste elimination areas with precision. We need to take a similar view with RCM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the problem with RCM in industrial facilities is two-part: it&amp;#39;s predominantly based on conjecture and it&amp;#39;s one-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the commercial aviation business, RCM is applied based upon extensive testing to understand a component&amp;#39;s failure rate, failure modes, etc. &amp;quot;In God we trust; all others bring data&amp;quot; is the aviation reliability engineer&amp;#39;s mantra. Lacking data about the nature of failures, most industrial reliability engineers must rely upon a great deal of guesswork when completing the failure modes and effects analyses (FMEAs) required to carry out the RCM process. As such, our results are typically biased based upon the individuals performing the analysis, the most recent failure modes, politics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps of more concern is that RCM, almost by definition, limits your reliability improvement efforts to maintenance. What&amp;#39;s the problem with that? Well, in the aviation industry, the creation of the maintenance policy presupposes that the equipment is designed to be reliable and maintainable and that reliability and maintainability have been measured and quantified to assess risk. Few industrial plants can boast the same. Likewise, RCM, as it is applied to the commercial aviation industry, presupposes that equipment is operated to exacting and procedure-based standards. Again, this is rarely the case in industrial manufacturing and process plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the plant, reliability problems that may adversely impact availability, yield and/or quality can be caused by any of a number of factors. Why limit your reliability improvement initiatives to maintenance? RCM, if done correctly, is based upon an FMEA or a failure modes and effects &amp;amp; criticality analysis (FMECA). If you&amp;#39;re going to go so far as to create a failure modes-based risk profile for your plant, why would you limit your risk-mitigation measures to maintenance? In many instances, changes in supply chain reliability, operations, sales and marketing, design, etc., will yield more reliability improvement than any changes strictly to equipment maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are a few examples illustrating where RCM misses the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Supply chain disruptions:&lt;/b&gt; If your raw materials supply chain is disrupted to a sufficient degree, availability will suffer. How can we pin this on the equipment? Can you describe a maintenance policy change that will correct this problem and mitigate the risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Excessive customization:&lt;/b&gt; If your sales organization commits the company to a high degree of customization - which extends the time it takes to complete a product changeover, increases the frequency with which product changeovers must be completed and/or increases the amount of time required to stabilize production - it&amp;#39;s tough to come up with an equipment maintenance strategy that will offset this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Misoperation:&lt;/b&gt; Suppose that your operations team is simply operating the machines incorrectly and inducing failure. It&amp;#39;s unrealistic to expect that a change in maintenance policy will offset this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I could create dozens of other examples, but you get the point. The bottom line is that the logical process that we call RCM works, but limiting it to equipment and changes in maintenance policy is na&amp;iuml;ve. Risks can be induced by many other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;#39;re going to subject yourself and your organization to the arduous process of performing an FMEA/FMECA, you must think holistically. Be sure to take a balanced approach when mitigating your operational reliability risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

            <title>RCM Blitz Analysis estimating tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A Reliability-Centered Maintenance analysis should be viewed as a serious exercise for your business. An RCM analysis is an investment that takes time, resources and money to complete.&amp;nbsp;As a result, we should always ensure that we are performing our analyses on assets that will show a return on the resources, time and money we invested in performing the analysis, implementing the tasks and performing the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to starting a RCM analysis, one of the upfront tasks that must be completed is estimating the size of the RCM analysis and the time it will take to complete the analysis phase of the project. The size of your RCM analysis and the time it takes to complete the analysis is dependent on four things;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of components/functions contained in the envelope of the analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of failure modes associated with these components/functions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The quality of information gathered prior to starting your analysis (how up-to-date are your drawings, OEMs and history?)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The experience of your RCM team and facilitator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new RCM team with an experienced RCM facilitator should be able to complete 85 to 100 functions and 120 to 140 failure modes in a one-week session. Completing failure modes is defined as identifying the failure modes, listing failure effects and making RCM task decisions. As the team and facilitator become more experienced, the number of functions and failure modes will increase over time by as much as 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To estimate the size and time it will take to complete a RCM Blitz analysis, select a critical asset and, using a P&amp;amp;ID drawing, begin highlighting and listing all the components within this system. Define a component as a modular asset that can be removed or repaired as a stand-alone item. For example, a gearbox is a component, a pump is a component, a limit switch is a component. While each component may contain several parts, the components are counted as a single item. Each will have one or more functions and can have several failure modes. Once you have completed your component list, multiply the number of components by 1.5; this will give you a estimated number of functions. Remember, you want to limit the number of functions in your first RCM to between 85 and 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that you have completed your component list, this will become the boundary of your RCM analysis. While other components outside this boundary may impact the performance or reliability of your asset, it is important to not list failure modes for components outside the boundary in this RCM analysis. These components and their failure modes may well be analyzed in your next analysis. Using your component list, you can now estimate the number of failure modes for your RCM analysis by using a failure modes estimating tool. The failure modes estimating tool contains a list of common failure modes for component types. As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a electrical motor as a component on our list. Looking at the estimating tool, we can see that a motor has five common failure modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor bearings fail due to contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor bearings fail due to lack of lubrication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor bearings fail due to over-lubrication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor bearings fail due to misalignment of motor to gearbox.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor windings fail due to insulation breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For each component on the list, you will now estimate the number of failure modes associated with that type of component. It should be noted that the failure modes contained in the common failure mode list are not a comprehensive list of failure modes. It is a list of what we most frequently see as failure modes. This list should never be used to create a RCM &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While these are common failure modes, we should never assume that these are the failures that your asset is experiencing. As you begin your RCM analysis, your team will develop your failure modes in accordance to what your asset is actually experiencing and what is likely to occur. Once you have noted the common failure modes for the components on your list, add up the total number of common failure modes. This will give you a estimate of the number of failure modes inside the boundary of your RCM analysis. Remember, you should limit the number of failure modes in your first RCM to between 120 and 140 failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>UC-Irvine offers Reliability-Centered Maintenance course</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The faster pace and higher stakes of the global economy have required those in plant and facilities management to increase efficiencies as much as possible while decreasing lost time due to maintenance. The adoption of Reliability-Centered Maintenance techniques for facilities, especially when applied to preventive maintenance, is gaining in popularity and directly contributing to companiesâ bottom lines. To better educate facilities managers about the benefits of reliability-centered preventive maintenance, the University of California-Irvine Extension is offering a new short course entitled âReliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM): Planning, Design and Implementation.â This three-day class begins Thursday, May 17 and runs through Saturday, May 19 from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. The course will be held at the &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName w:st="on"&gt;UCI&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceName w:st="on"&gt;Learning&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceType w:st="on"&gt;Center&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt; in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Orange&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Calif.&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Course instructor Neil Bloom, B.S.M.E., is well versed in the area of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). For more than 30 years, he has worked in close association with the two prominent and leading-edge federal agencies responsible for reliability and safety, namely the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Bloom has been responsible for developing and managing what is, perhaps, one of the most comprehensive RCM-based preventive maintenance programs ever developed, which served to analyze more than 125,000 components at one of the countryâs largest nuclear generating facilities. Bloom is the author of âReliability Centered Maintenance â Implementation Made Simpleâ published by McGraw-Hill. He has been a guest speaker on RCM at some of the most prestigious national and international conferences, including the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Nuclear Society (ANS), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Vienna&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;Austria&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The face of effective reliability management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my consulting and educating roles at Noria, I&amp;rsquo;m often asked what effective plant reliability management looks like. How does one recognize it when he or she sees it? While there are plenty of details, I&amp;rsquo;ve boiled it down to the following 12 dimensional elements. Naturally, there is much more detail, but I&amp;rsquo;ve described these key elements for you here in abstract form. This article is short enough to keep the attention of even the highest-level managers in your company. So if you agree with the philosophies, pass it along to them. I&amp;rsquo;ve written the article in MBA language, not reliability engineering-speak, for that very purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 12 elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Strong leadership focus and business-aligned plant reliability mission, vision and strategic plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Your leaders, both at the corporate and plant levels, must keenly understand the impact reliability has on the bottom-line performance of the organization, including the share price. The valuation of an equipment asset-dependent organization is significantly affected by the effectiveness with which that equipment is managed. Your leadership must understand that reliability management is not just doing maintenance better. Without knowledgeable and truly engaged senior leaders who are willing to make plant reliability management a matter of corporate policy, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely that you&amp;rsquo;ll gain traction and achieve lasting improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Effective interfunctional and interplant communications&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, when things go wrong, the typical modus operandi in most plants is to begin the process of assigning blame. Operations blames maintenance, maintenance blames operations and the design engineering group, everybody blames suppliers, and so on. Rarely does this process yield productive results. Poor communication between co-dependent functional groups almost guarantees poor reliability performance. Moreover, organizations that have multiple plants often fail to take advantage of the knowledge and economy of scale afforded to them, either because of a culture of internal competition or the lack of effective interplant communication systems through which to share knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Focus on design for reliability, operability, maintainability, safety and inspectability (ROMSI).&lt;/strong&gt; Most organizations have attempted to improve reliability strictly from the maintenance department. It simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Poor overall reliability is the result of poor basic &amp;ldquo;design for reliability,&amp;rdquo; given the required operating context; improper operation, which may be the result of poor &amp;ldquo;design for operability&amp;rdquo;; and ineffective maintenance, which may be the result of poor &amp;ldquo;design for maintainability and inspectability.&amp;rdquo; Some studies suggest that half of all failures are directly attributable to poor design. Designing reliable equipment and plants requires risk assessment, clear knowledge of the operating context, involvement from operations and maintenance domain experts, and a leadership focus on minimizing life-cycle cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Reliability-focused operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Equipment that is started, stopped and/or operated incorrectly, or beyond its operating limits, will simply experience a higher failure rate. A reliability-focused operations team follows and enforces well-conceived standard operating procedures. They also understand that, in some instances, producing more can result in profit erosion. The mentality extends beyond plant operations to the sales and marketing department. An enlightened sales and marketing team understands that the profitability of sales contracts and the reputation of the firm depend upon the reliability of the machines or plant, especially when transactions carry penalties for late or non-delivery &amp;ndash; in some cases, total-loss penalties. They factor projected reliability into their pro forma estimates of contract profitability. The reliability-focused operations organization works closely with the maintenance team, particularly to provide inspection and operating health feedback on a regular basis, and supplies design engineers, procurement specialists and strategic suppliers with the information they need to improve equipment operability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Reliability-focused maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt; While maintenance can&amp;rsquo;t improve the reliability of equipment, they can ensure that its inherent reliability, based upon design and operating context, is maximized. A reliability-focused organization doesn&amp;rsquo;t just employ modern techniques like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), condition-based maintenance (CBM) and precision maintenance techniques. A reliability-focused maintenance organization works hard to optimize maintenance activities, with a focus on running time activities. It also works closely with operations to ensure that the equipment is available to produce as much product as required, meet quality goals and, most importantly, satisfy customer demands. And, a reliability-focused organization works closely with design engineers, procurement specialists and strategic suppliers to improve design for reliability and maintainability, and to avoid purchasing the same problems over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Effective talent management.&lt;/strong&gt; The success or failure of your reliability management program will ultimately come down to the people who are involved. Effective plant reliability managers recognize that talent management goes beyond just hiring people with the right skills for the job; performance is also a function of behaviors. Skills can be taught; behaviors can&amp;rsquo;t. In fact, it is quite difficult to significantly modify an individual&amp;rsquo;s behaviors beyond a temporary interim period. Effective plant reliability management requires that you identify the behavioral characteristics required to succeed in your organization and in the job, the skills and knowledge required for the job, a method for assessing both, and tools and techniques for managing and retaining your talent. In the tough talent market projected for the future, talent management may differentiate the winners from the losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) Strategic customer and supplier relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppliers and customers alike are critical to the success of your reliability program. A major component of the Toyota Production System (commonly referred to as lean manufacturing) is negotiating production and delivery time with the customer, both internal and external, for the purpose of load-leveling. At times, delivery deadlines aren&amp;rsquo;t deadlines at all; they are just dates that are selected. Understanding which delivery deadlines are real and which ones are arbitrary can help you openly discuss matters with your customers. This helps you create a pull-based production system while avoiding the added stress on the equipment and organization to meet arbitrary deadlines. A similar strategic relationship must exist with your suppliers. A vendor is a machine that dispenses a soft drink or snack in exchange for money. You need strategic supplier partners, both for process and MRO materials. Strategic partners bring important knowledge and experience to the table, which enables you to plan more effectively; improve design, operations and maintenance; and more effectively assess problems and shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8) Reliability data collection and analysis systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Reliability management and improvement requires data. Surprisingly few organizations collect, analyze and manage reliability data effectively. From a technical perspective, reliability starts with a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), the reliability blueprint of an operational service or machine. Often, the FMEA is completed by drawing on limited data experience, and that is the end of the process. The FMEA worksheets serve as a reliability growth management tool. Each time you learn something new, you modify the FMEA and its associated risk priority number (RPN), a 1 to 1,000 rating of the risks associated with a failure based upon severity, likelihood and detectability. This means the organization&amp;rsquo;s plant must be committed to collecting operational and maintenance-related data &amp;ndash; both when things are going well and when things go wrong. Mathematical reliability engineering methods and associated tools (such as root cause analysis) enable you to implement information-based improvement initiatives. Performance monitoring and detailed failure data collection techniques are an absolute must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9) Procedure, document and knowledge management support systems.&lt;/strong&gt; In applications where failure risk is potentially deadly, such as the commercial aviation industry, managers long ago stopped relying on the &amp;ldquo;skill of the operator&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;skill of the maintenance craft.&amp;rdquo; Standard operating and maintenance procedures combined with checklists define expectations. Procedures and checklists are necessary to ensure consistency of practice among different people and over time. And, when staff changes do occur, procedures are required to assure continuity. Too many plants have too much of their intellectual property residing in the heads of staff members that could resign, retire or take ill at any time. Procedures also clearly define skill requirements for a particular job or activity. The modern, reliability-focused organization employs clearly defined operating, design and maintenance procedures, enforces them, and incorporates easy-to-use systems for executing work and managing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;10) Targeted leading and lagging metrics.&lt;/strong&gt; Leading metrics reveal performance on causal factors that, when effectively managed, yields desirable performance on lagging indicators &amp;ndash; the effect. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s common for Japanese plants to track the number of small group meetings they have related to Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). The premise is that more small group meetings results in better communication between functional groups (the cause), which results in fewer mistakes, better plant performance, and improved efficiency and effectiveness in responding to problems and opportunities (the effect). To be effective, your metrics, both leading and lagging, must accurately reflect reliability goals that align with the organization&amp;rsquo;s mission. The management team must understand that cause and effect probably won&amp;rsquo;t be time-synchronous, hence the term &amp;ldquo;lagging.&amp;rdquo; Also, left unchecked, metrics can take control of your organization. Don&amp;rsquo;t let the organization focus so much on the metric that it loses sight of the mission. To paraphrase W. Edwards Deming, don&amp;rsquo;t allow metrics to replace leadership, judgment and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;11) Vision-centric team reward system.&lt;/strong&gt; What gets rewarded gets done. Despite this obvious fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a long history of rewarding failure in industrial manufacturing plants, both extrinsically and intrinsically. For example, when a machine fails over the weekend without warning and technicians are called in to address the event, they are extrinsically rewarded with overtime pay. For many, failure-induced overtime pay is so common that the technicians have adjusted their lifestyle to reflect it. Moreover, when the plant manager or maintenance manager returns to the plant, he or she rightly seeks out the technicians responsible for restoring operations and intrinsically rewards them with thanks and praise for their efforts. In both cases, the rewards are appropriate; but in both cases, they create an incentive for unreliability. Reliability-focused organizations reward reliability, not failure. The reward structure must be modified to create an incentive for the desired behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;12) Reliability culture management.&lt;/strong&gt; Arguably, the most difficult aspect of plant reliability management is creating a reliability-focused culture. People and organizations like to hang on to past practices, resisting change. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always done it this way&amp;rdquo; is commonly heard around the plant. The desire to anchor to what has always been done is a phenomenon referred to as &amp;ldquo;psychological inertia.&amp;rdquo; Reliability-focused organizations continuously question current practices and look for ways to improve. This pattern of behavior takes time to establish and much work to perpetuate. It&amp;rsquo;s imperative to create a plan for achieving behavioral change, starting with lead users and early adopters and gradually making making it to those people who are slower to adopt or who actively oppose the change. There is a point at which a sufficient percentage of the organization will come around. That is when you&amp;rsquo;ll achieve critical mass. But getting to that point requires leadership, patience and tenacity. Once you&amp;rsquo;re there, you have to keep the pressure on until the new practice becomes a &amp;ldquo;new business as usual&amp;rdquo; to replace the old one, or the organization will gradually slip back into its old comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be sure your organization understands these important elements and the impact they have on your organization&amp;rsquo;s performance &amp;ndash; starting at the very top. Without that leadership focus, nothing else matters. Again, pass the article along and get more of your organization on the reliability management bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/reliability-centered_maintenance/~4/Dgciy64i9-E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability-centered sales?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Veteran reliability professionals have heard about various &amp;ldquo;reliability-centered&amp;rdquo; activities. Most are familiar with Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), and many have extended the reliability-centered concept to equipment, process, and/or plant design (RCD) and operation (RCO). Does reliability have a place in the world of sales? I submit that it&amp;rsquo;s a critical function to involve in the reliability process, arguably the most critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s start by deconstructing a typical sales and delivery transaction. In most instances, the sales organization consults with the customer to determine its needs in terms of product type, quantity, required quality and delivery expectations. After negotiation, the salespeople typically reach an agreement on pricing and terms with the customer and a contract is executed. Upon receipt of the purchase order, production schedules the job, manufactures the product in compliance with the company&amp;rsquo;s safety and environmental management policies and prepares the order for shipping to the customer. The customer demands product, price, quality and transport from the sales department. The sales department, in turn, demands that the production department manufacture the product to comply with the terms set forth by the customer, and the production department demands reliability from the machine, process and plant design team, and from the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the surface, it appears that the issue of reliability is between the production department and the maintenance department on a day-to-day basis and between production, maintenance and the design team in the longer term, but that conclusion is flawed. Divorcing sales from the reliability equation creates a serious and potentially costly gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, the contract forged between the sales department and the customer contains negative covenants that are triggered by the company&amp;rsquo;s failure to comply with quality and/or delivery specifications. For example, failure to deliver on-time might trigger financial penalties that erode or eliminate the profit on the sale. If the delivered quality is off-specification, the contract typically contains a provision by which the customer can reject the shipment, forcing the company to ship the product back to the plant or another location, sell the product to another customer at a lower price, re-run the product through the process, etc. &amp;ndash; all of which add cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When product is rejected due to non-conforming quality, penalties invoked for non-delivery may also apply, compounding the loss of profit. Even when no financial penalties apply, the company&amp;rsquo;s reputation and relationship with the customer may be adversely affected when there&amp;rsquo;s failure to deliver per the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, despite the popular notion that most machines have a constant failure rate over time, the actual risk of failure for an entire plant or production line system decreases over some period following an outage or shutdown (infant mortality failures), then it typically levels out and begins to gradually increase as a function of time or production units (see figure). This occurs because some failure modes within the aggregated system are time-dependent and because of the cumulative effect of misoperation and/or the deferring of maintenance. Over time, the risk profile for selling, producing and delivering product changes. If modeled correctly, this data can be utilized to achieve the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1)&lt;strong&gt; Risk-rationalize the profitability of a transaction:&lt;/strong&gt; If the sales department has negotiated a sale with a tough customer that forces the organization to accept razor-thin margins and assume the risk of negative covenants (e.g. non-delivery clause), looking at the projected profit on a straight, non-risk adjusted basis is simply flawed. It is analogous to evaluating an investment opportunity without considering the time value of money. When one incorporates the reliability risk factor into the transaction analysis, the sale may prove to be below the company&amp;rsquo;s required profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) &lt;strong&gt;Rationalized investments in reliability&lt;/strong&gt;: Candidly, the benefits of reliability investments can seem a little nebulous for some people. However, if the risk profile of the plant is defined, the value of reliability investments can be defined in terms of contribution margin per item for any given point in time. WOW! That puts things into hard dollars for which no stretch is required. It makes it easy to determine if the organization should spend more or less on reliability growth/improvement investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_exponent-pic1.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img border="1" height="102" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_exponent-pic1-thumb.jpg" width="100" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The condition of the plant affects the true profitability of a transaction where now-or-never delivery and/or non-delivery penalties apply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While relating reliability data and information to create risk-based production profitability estimates and incorporating that data into the sales process may seem new to the manufacturing and process plant reliability management community, you are probably accustomed to this process at a personal level. In essence, when you profile the reliability of a production line or plant as a function of time or other applicable factors, you create what amounts to actuarial tables to demonstrate the risk profile, much the same as a life or health insurance firm. These organizations understand that the human body follows the &amp;ldquo;bathtub curve,&amp;rdquo; which defines risk as a function of time. Adjusting for age and to reflect genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices, which are analogous to equipment/plant design, operations and maintenance, the insurance company sets the price of your premiums based upon a probabilistic risk profile. They clearly understand the relationship between risk and the profitability of each sales transaction. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we in the plant reliability management business do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The methods for creating risk-adjusted profitability analysis are well-defined thanks to other industries, especially insurance. We simply need to apply these techniques in the plant. So in addition to getting plant operations, design engineering, and plant and senior management educated about reliability, I suggest you get your sales and marketing departments up to speed about the value of effective plant reliability management. Get support from sales and marketing, the voice of the customer, and the generators of revenue and margins supporting reliability within your organization and it will become much easier to get appropriate, cost-justified reliability improvement projects approved because it clarifies the relationship between reliability and the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Reliability-centered 'workforce' maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;It never ceases to amaze me that no matter what industry you are in or how big or small of a company you work for, success is dependent on the ability to find, attract, hire, manage, develop and retain the right people. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Itâs a timeless principle of business. In fact, in his book âGood to Greatâ, Jim Collins talks about the ability of getting âthe right people on the bus and the wrong people off the busâ as one of the common characteristics among companies able to be classified as âgreat.â Furthermore, he implies that if you donât have the right people on the bus, you canât achieve greatness. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That really makes sense. However, I continue to see companies disproportionately dedicate more focus and investment into non-people issues such as technology or equipment than focusing on getting âthe right people on the bus.â I havenât quite figured out why, but I believe it could boil down to one of three reasons: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You really donât believe your people are your most important asset. Thatâs just the ârightâ thing to say. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You believe that people are your most important asset, but you donât know where to go from there. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You believe that people are your most important asset, but you have limited time and resources to build the world-class organization that you want to become. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fortunately, for those in the business of maintenance who have adopted some form of strategic maintenance strategy, it should be easy to overcome these hurdles and start moving your business into elite status. You already have a mind-set for making proactive business decisions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs just start with the concept of Reliability-Centered Maintenance. RCM is generally defined as the process of identifying the maintenance requirements of assets in order for those assets to safely operate and perform as designed at an optimal level. (To learn more about RCM, visit www.reliableplant.com and read âA Whirlpool revolutionâ in the Archives section.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the whole concept of RCM makes sense to you, why not apply that same approach to your people practices. That way, you can build a sound workforce strategy and support your business case for the appropriate level of resources needed to execute that strategy. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Moving forward, letâs do a little evaluation. When is the last time you asked these questions about your workforce? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who are the critical people in our organization? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What functions and performance expectations do we have of these people? &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What can cause these people to fail? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What are the consequences of failure? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What can we do to prevent such failures? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What are our options in case we determine we canât prevent these failures? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does this sound familiar? These are probably the types of questions you asked about your critical equipment when developing your RCM program. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Now, I agree that managing people can be much more complex than managing machines. For instance . . . Machines donât leave you for another company. They donât ask for raises. They donât have feelings. They donât need performance plans. And, they generally do what you expect them to do. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But, these are precisely the differences and reasons why your organization needs to invest more into its people than its machines. After all, at the end of the day, it is your people who determine whether or not your Reliability-Centered Maintenance program is successful, right? &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>A Whirlpool revolution</title>
            <description>&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=10 width=200 align=right border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;H3 class=subtitle6 align=center&gt;Just the Facts&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Whirlpool Corporation in Findlay, Ohio&lt;BR&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Employment&lt;/STRONG&gt;: 2,060 (1,900 hourly)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Square footage&lt;/STRONG&gt;: 1.03 million square feet of manufacturing space.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Products&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Eight dishwasher brands, including Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Roper and Kenmore.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Production volume&lt;/STRONG&gt;: 2.3 million dishwashers in 2004.&lt;BR&gt;FYI: Whirlpool-Findlay is the largest dishwasher manufacturing plant in the world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Whirlpool Corporation runs in familiar circles. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mechanically, the inner workings of this companyâs dishwashers and washing machines twirl around water and detergent to clean up your cooking and clothing messes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Financially, itâs a $13 billion-a-year firm that for decades has held a prestigious spot on the Fortune 500 list (No. 79 in the 2005 rankings). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Societally, itâs one of the worldâs most recognizable brands. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And socially, it holds upper-hand status on its well-known consumer appliance cronies â General Electric, Maytag and Frigidaire. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Familiarity is one of Whirlpoolâs biggest assets, but itâs also a major challenge. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe marketplace is changing and itâs being led by companies that we do not know nearly as much about,â says Larry Dunfee, the manager of Consumer-Centered Manufacturing at Whirlpoolâs site in Findlay, Ohio, the largest dishwasher manufacturing plant in the world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Thatâs not spin. If you havenât heard of companies such as Shian Jing, Wenling Changtian and Naiko Asia â kitchen appliance manufacturers from China and Taiwan â you will soon. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe are used to competing against North American manufacturers in dishwashers. We know them and they know us,â Dunfee says. âWe are all in the high-labor-cost North American market. We can all make improvements, but nobody has a strong leg up on anybody else. But now, weâre starting to see other companies coming from low-wage countries. They are starting to market their products in North America at a competitive price point. We see the possibilities of them using the leverage they have from a labor cost standpoint. That will put us in a difficult position to compete unless we do things differently.â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Whirlpoolâs response is revolution. While still entrenched as the No. 1 player in the sector, the company has churned the waters and sought ways to: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;maximize its mechanical assets; and, &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;maximize the contributions of its workforce. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Revolution has resulted in increased uptime, productivity and quality. This postively impacts revenue, profitability and share price. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_whirlpool_appliances.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 class=subtitle3&gt;The Pieces Fit Together &lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The 2,000 employees at Whirlpoolâs 1 million-square-foot facility in Findlay, Ohio, are no stranger to the concepts of machine reliability and empowerment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance management, in conjunction with production and operations leaders, introduced Total Productive Manufacturing (TPM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) to the plant in the mid- and late-1990s. And early on, plant-floor employees played key roles in implementing improvement projects. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The difference, comparing 2005 with 1995, is cohesiveness. Whirlpool improvement tools now fit together instead of, in some cases, running parallel to one another. And, maintenance and production workers more uniformally buy into the vision that âwe are all responsible for the equipment.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 class=subtitle3&gt;TPM + RCM = Results &lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;TPM (also known as Total Productive Maintenance) is a team-based approach to maintaining the condition of equipment. Its key components are operator ownership of equipment, continuous identification and implementation of improvements, and the development of planned maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whirlpool places approximately 10 area operators and maintenance personnel across the various shifts on a TPM team. In TPMâs formative years at Whirlpool, a team was led by a process engineer or area supervisor. After receiving instruction on the principles of TPM and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE is a metric that tracks sources of operating loss, including equipment availability, performance and quality), each team began to identify opportunities in its functional area. The team then sought and implemented solutions to eliminate identified sources of loss. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Today, hourly workers share leadership roles on each of the plantâs 32 teams. In another departure from the past, RCM has become an important part of the TPM curriculum. All teams now get early exposure to an RCM analysis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=208 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_whirlpool_workers.jpg" width=150 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Electrical engineer Tom Jones (right) &lt;BR&gt;works closely with production workers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;RCM links a structured thought process to the knowledge of a cross-functional team. Over a three- to five-day period, the goal is to develop a complete maintenance strategy for a process or piece of equipment. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;During a recent RCM event, for example, senior reliability engineer Richard Word served as the facilitator of a 12-member cross-functional group that included two operators, two electricians, one operations supervisor, one operations engineer, one plastic molding technician, one quality process analyst, one millwright, one maintenance engineer, one maintenance supervisor and one supplier representative. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This group painstakingly analyzed the components of a vertical plastic press (hydraulic heat exchanger, flow control valve, light curtain, etc.), pinpointed all of the failure modes and effects, and implemented a maintenance strategy for each component to make the overall press more robust. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=206 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_whirlpool_group.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Senior reliability engineer Richard Word (seated in middle) &lt;BR&gt;is flanked by the members of his recent RCM team.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All total, they followed a 14-step analytical process: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Review the equipmentâs operational history. 
&lt;LI&gt;Detail the parameters for probability of failure. 
&lt;LI&gt;Detail the parameters for consequence of failure. 
&lt;LI&gt;List the main functions. 
&lt;LI&gt;List the sub-functions. 
&lt;LI&gt;List the failure modes. 
&lt;LI&gt;List the failure effects. 

&lt;LI&gt;List the downtime. 
&lt;LI&gt;List the consequence. 
&lt;LI&gt;Navigate a decision tree. 
&lt;LI&gt;Determine the proper maintenance task. 
&lt;LI&gt;Determine the need for stocking a spare part. 
&lt;LI&gt;Review the completeness of the analysis for the time scheduled. 
&lt;LI&gt;Do a reality check. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âRCM is a good kickoff to the TPM team,â says maintenance and tooling manager John Siefker. âThey really review the process and the equipment. It is a learning exercise of how it actually works. When you have an operator alongside a maintenance technician and an engineer, they start talking together about different components and what they do. Everyone provides their real-world perspective. Suddenly, light bulbs go on. This gives everyone a better understanding of the total process and what the end result is.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To date, more than 20 percent of workers at the Findlay plant have participated in an RCM event. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Up until a few years ago, RCM analyses functioned mostly independent from other improvement projects. In large part, they now exist to provide perspective and work tasks for TPM teams. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of the RCM implementation involves reviewing and transferring a detailed maintenance task into the preventive maintenance (PM) system. PM tasks, which used to be highly generic in nature, now are information-heavy. Each task includes equipment status (running, anytime or down), an action verb (check, measure, inspect), the specific component (main motor), the specific condition (quantifiable whenever possible) and a reference to a condition-monitoring standard (if available or required). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Responsibility for tackling these PM tasks is generally split 50/50 between operators and maintenance technicians. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;âTPM and RCM are not separate entities anymore,â says Word. âThey always complemented one another, but we have gotten to the point where they come together and cross paths.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=173 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/200507_whirlpool_plant_leaders.jpg" width=150 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant leaders, including facilities engineering &lt;BR&gt;manager Randy Statzer (left), Consumer-Centered &lt;BR&gt;Manufacturing manager Larry Dunfee and TPM &lt;BR&gt;facilitator Jim Dray, help oversee the progress &lt;BR&gt;of the reliability initiatives.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 class=subtitle3&gt;âWe Are All Responsibleâ&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Shifting many of the maintenance functions to operators has allowed operators to take more âownershipâ of the equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOperators originally thought their job was making components or assembling dishwashers,â says TPM facilitator Jim Dray. âThatâs changed. We stress that you are responsible for the health and productivity of the equipment. Itâs your job. Itâs everyoneâs job at this plant.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ownership means operators perform PM tasks such as cleaning and lubricating the machinery, changing belts and hoses, and monitoring heat strips and gauge tape. It also means that they handle many predictive maintenance tasks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWeâve given out some handheld infrared guns. We also have ultrasound equipment that our equipment setup operators can use,â says Dray. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;All this allows maintenance technicians to focus more on activities that actually prevent mechanical failures. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âPrevention is at the top of our list now,â says electrical engineer Tom Jones. âItâs better to prevent failure than predict it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, representatives from maintenance and engineering work with equipment suppliers and supply them with ideas, feedback and the performance history of similar equipment currently in use. The end result is equipment that is more robust and more reliable before it even is installed on the plant floor at Whirlpool. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That sharing relationship continues after the installation. For example, a representative from Battenfeld, a manufacturer of injection molding machines, served on the recent RCM project. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWeâre still exploring ways to reach out and involve our supply base,â says Dunfee. âThis is an area of opportunity.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By focusing on prevention as opposed to settling for detection, Word says the plant has been able to surpass the 90 percent mark in uptime. Also, unplanned maintenance activities accounted for just 13.4 percent of documented work orders during a recent 30-day period. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 class=subtitle3&gt;Stepping Up to The Plate&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failure prevention and unified equipment ownership are also evident in the plantâs push to develop the problem-solving skills of its workers. This is further proof of the integrated nature of Whirlpoolâs improvement tools. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;TPM team members, the same ones who go through an RCM analysis, receive training on additional âlean manufacturingâ concepts such as Continuous Improvement. The CI process attacks areas of opportunity with a formal seven-step problem-solving methodology. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The steps include: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;State the initial (general, non-specific) problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clarify the problem. (Whatâs the specific defect? What is standard vs. actual? What is the target for the specific problem?) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pinpoint current processes that contribute to the problem. (What specific action or actions caused the non-standard condition?) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Identify the root cause of the problem. (The real cause is often hidden behind more obvious symptoms.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Suggest countermeasures to ensure the problem doesnât happen again. (These are ideas to attack the root cause.) &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Create plans to implement the countermeasures. (Get the formal battle plan in order to attack the root cause.) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Implement countermeasures and perform a follow-up. (Were the countermeasures effective? If yes, continue to monitor and ensure the solution sticks. If no, backtrack and develop new countermeasures.) &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThis is a disciplined approach to problem-solving as opposed to shooting from the hip,â says Jones, explaining that traditional methods may or may not address the root cause or may focus on the âtrivial manyâ issues as opposed to the âmeaningful few.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In a recent TPM Steering Committee meeting, teams presented case studies on how they solved problems related to non-fitting console seals, inconsistent performance on screwdriving assembly guns and impaired visibility of cycle indicator lights. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These problem-solving exercises are required for TPM teams to obtain and retain a Whirlpool certification status (see sidebar for certification guidelines). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On top of CI, the plant also incorporates lean thinking in a practice called âgembaâ walks. (Gemba is a Japanese term that roughly translates to âthe place where value is added.â) Here, maintenance and production leaders, hourly workers and even division vice president John Haywood stroll through a particular area of the facility and identify areas of waste, non-value activities, and ergonomic or safety issues. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Waste elimination is a major push. As one sign in the plant states: âIf it doesnât add value, itâs waste! What are you doing to reduce waste? Are you, as a customer, willing to pay for overproduction, inventory, long changeovers, searching for tools/parts, unplanned downtime, rework/scrap, unnecessary long distances or keeping ideas to yourself?â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the metrics used by the plant to record levels of waste is critical process yield. CPY accounts for many sources of loss. It starts with a baseline of maximum theoretical production rate and then all the sources of loss are calculated and deducted to give the percent of theoretical maximum capacity. At a high level, the sources of loss include availability, performance and quality. As the CPY figure increases, so does productivity. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Prior to the maturation and cohesion of Whirlpoolâs improvement tools, assets at the Findlay plant produced at 60 to 70 percent of their capability. Benchmarks indicated that 85 to 90 percent was possible. In recent years, the plant CPY average rose to 79 percent in 2003, 84 percent in 2004 and 85 percent for the first three months of 2005. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf we are making the right decisions and doing the right maintenance, it all comes together and we have some assurances,â says Jones. âAll of this puts less stress on me and everyone else.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 class=subtitle3&gt;Revolutionâs Evolution &lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This Findlay, Ohio, plant is a shining example of what can happen when energized people and powerful tools come together to drive improvement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whirlpool has seen the benefits. It knows that this model allows it to better address present and future challenges and challengers. Therefore, itâs working to spread the news. Word is visiting sister sites in North America this year to teach strategies for RCM implementation. Dray did the same for TPM in years prior. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Back in Findlay, though, nobody is resting on laurels. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhen your ultimate goal is continuous improvement, you never get there,â says Dray. âItâs a never-ending process. Thatâs difficult for some people. They say, âGive me a goal. Iâll achieve it. Iâm done. Whatâs next?â With this, there is no end.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It just goes round and round ... like a circle. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clean and inspect. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Create a comprehensive spare parts list and make it widely available. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Identify and document all lubrication points. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Eliminate problem sources and inaccessible areas. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Draw up cleaning, lubricating and inspection schedules. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Implement skilled trades inspections. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Define operator, skilled trades and shared tasks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Train operators and skilled trades. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Communicate implementation progress to the whole team. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Look for continuous improvement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Certification review. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
