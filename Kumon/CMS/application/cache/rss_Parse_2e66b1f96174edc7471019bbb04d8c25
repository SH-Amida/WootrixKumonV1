		<title>Analysis of Connected and Automated Vehicle Technologies Highlights Uncertainty in Potential Effects on Fuel Use, Miles Traveled</title>
		<description>A joint study from the U.S. Department of Energyâs National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Argonne National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed the potential effects of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies on fuel use and efficiency, vehicle miles traveled, and consumer costs. The analysis focused on a range of light-duty CAV technologies in conventional powertrain vehiclesâfrom partial automation with some connectivity to full automation with maximum connectivity, with and without ridesharingâcompared to todayâs base-case scenario.</description>

		<title>Six Common City-Level Energy Policies Could Reduce Nationwide Carbon Emissions by up to 480 Million Metric Tons Annually</title>
		<description>The Energy Departmentâs (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory recently examined the carbon abatement potential of city actions in six policy areas as part of the DOEâs Cities Leading through Energy Analysis and Planning (Cities-LEAP) project. The analysis uses new data on energy use in more than 23,400 U.S. cities and estimates the aggregate impact of city actions related to: building energy codes, public transit, building energy incentives, rooftop photovoltaics, smart growth, and municipal actions. The results indicate that by 2035, these six common city-level policy approaches could reduce nationwide carbon emissions by 210â480 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year. That is a 7â19 percent reduction in carbon emissions for the average city relative to current city-level emissions.</description>
