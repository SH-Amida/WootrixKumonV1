			<title>Rise in lower extremity injuries possible result of new concussion prevention rules</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160305111838.htm</link>
			<description>NCAA tackling rule changes that penalize head to head contact, and encourage tackling of the lower extremity have had some proven impacts in collegiate football. However, according to researchers an unintended consequence of these rule changes may be higher rates of knee, ankle and thigh injuries. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>As America continues to adopt more children internationally than any other country, hundreds of thousands of children in the U.S. -- most of whom are children of color -- sit in foster care awaiting adoption. Though some Americans express a desire to adopt non-white children, even they have limitations when it comes to adopting children of certain races, especially African Americans, according to a new study. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Marine protected areas intensify both cooperation and competition</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160304160403.htm</link>
			<description>Marine protected areas generate both extreme cooperation and extreme competition among commercial fishers. When these behaviors remain in balance, they can lead to better conservation of marine resources, a new study finds. However, if competition among fishers increases while cooperation declines, it could threaten the long-term survival of marine protected areas, their biodiversity and the communities that depend on them. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Is investment in research to develop new treatments the best approach to controlling cancer? Many people believe that the time is right for another big push to defeat cancer, including President Obama, who called for a major cancer-fighting campaign in his final State of the Union address. But in a new paper, this kind of effort will never cure cancer without public health and prevention. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>An analysis of more than 14 million reviews on RateMyProfessors.com, where students write anonymous reviews of their professors, found that students most often use the words 'brilliant' and 'genius' to describe male professors and in academic disciplines in which women and African-Americans are underrepresented. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Experimental economics: Results you can trust</title>

			<description>Reproducibility is an important measure of validity in experimental science. If researcher A publishes a result from his laboratory, researcher B should be able to follow the same protocol and achieve the same result in her laboratory. However, recently many results in a variety of disciplines have been questioned for their lack of reproducibility. A new study suggests that published results from experimental economics are better than average when it comes to reproducibility. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fuel or food? Study sees increasing competition for land, water resources</title>

			<description>About one-third of the world's malnourished population could be fed by using resources now used for biofuel production, new research indicates. As strategies for energy security, investment opportunities and energy policies prompt ever-growing production and consumption of biofuels like bioethanol and biodiesel, land and water that could otherwise be used for food production increasingly are used to produce crops for fuel. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Most doctors and nurses review a patientâs family history to identify risk factors for heart disease and cancer, often through a paper checklist or brief interview. But more deliberate efforts to map a patientâs family tree could identify additional risks and drive patients to timely screenings for illnesses that may unknowingly affect them, according to a new study. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>For the first time, researchers have determined a signature of changes that occur to human remains, specifically bones, left outside in the New England environment. This signature or 'patterning' can be used by law enforcement to help determine if remains have been moved after death from one environment to another and to separate natural changes to bone from those caused by possible perpetrators. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>A professor spent a year working as a paper picker at a large mega-landfill on the outskirts of Detroit, M.I., to explore the relationship North Americans have with garbage. His two big takeaways: a) People don't think twice about what happens to the garbage they throw out and b) the American dream of two cars, a house and perfect commodities is made possible by creating tons of waste. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Why pharmaceutical firms may prefer to invest in drugs over vaccines</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302204516.htm</link>
			<description>When it comes to addressing disease, many industry observers and public health advocates believe that pharmaceutical companies prefer to invest in drugs rather than vaccines, as preventives are perceived to be inherently less profitable. A new study on preventives versus treatments offers a new economic rationale for this trend -- the population risk for diseases resembles a Zipf distribution, where the demand curve for a drug is likely to support stronger revenue extraction from a drug than for a vaccine. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Cancer of the colon or rectum is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 140,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with colorectal cancer, and more than 50,000 people die from it. Colorectal cancer is preventable through screenings that detect and remove small, pre-cancerous growths called polyps. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Inflated charges and significant variation in patterns of payments have been found for surgical care.

			<title>State laws boost flu vaccination rates in health care workers</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302121329.htm</link>
			<description>State laws mandating influenza immunization for people who work in health care increase their vaccination rates, according to new research. From 2000 to 2005, only Maine and New Hampshire had flu vaccine requirement laws for health care workers. During that period, the average flu vaccination rate for health care workers was 22.5 percent. From 2006 to 2011--when 19 other states, including Pennsylvania, passed similar laws--the average vaccination rate for health care workers increased to 50.9 percent. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Hair analysis has become standard practice for determining whether someone has abused illicit drugs. But some experts have questioned whether current methods to wash away external contaminants from samples might affect test results. Now one team confirms that for cocaine detection, a pretreatment step can cause the drug on the outside of a hair shaft to wash into it and potentially lead to falsely identifying someone as a drug user. <!-- more --></description>
