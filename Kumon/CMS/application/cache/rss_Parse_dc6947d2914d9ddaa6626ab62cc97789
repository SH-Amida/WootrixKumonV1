          &lt;p&gt;Over two-thirds of American manufacturers plan on making capital investments in equipment during 2017, according to a new survey of 250 manufacturing executives conducted by Leading Age Alliance (LEA Global). Among high-growth manufacturers surveyed, 77% said their companies will make capital investments this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 National Manufacturing Outlook and Insights report by the international association of independently-owned accounting and consulting firms found that 69% of respondents said their company is planning for capital expenditures on equipment in 2017, followed by plant expansion and modernization (38%), and computer software (37%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While new equipment was found to be the top capital expenditures for 2017, cutting operational costs was identified as the top priority for manufacturers in the year by almost half of the respondents (47%), trailed closely by seeking new markets (46%) and long-term strategic planning (41%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material costs are projected to rise or increase significantly over 2017 by 50% of respondents, with labor costs forecasted to increase or increase significantly by 75% of respondants.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/news/images/Lori-Clark-300dpi.jpeg?itok=Bx_GcZT8&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; alt=&quot;Lori Clark, the new VP of Operations at Volkmann Inc.

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/news/images/NewsAttachment_31245.jpg?itok=b8_ZU5si&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; alt=&quot;A composite part made by Evonik&amp;#039;s PulPress method. Image courtesy of Evonik&quot; title=&quot;A composite part made by Evonik&amp;#039;s PulPress method. Image courtesy of Evonik&quot; /&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;German specialty chemicals company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evonik.com/&quot;&gt;Evonik&lt;/a&gt; announced the introduction of a new technology for the mass, automated production of molded composite components on Monday that combines compression molding and pultrusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system, dubbed the PulPress method, combines the two traditional production techniques into an automated, continuous manufacturing technology that wraps fibers around Evonik&amp;rsquo;s ROHACELL high-performance structural foam core before impregnation with resin. Manufacturers can fine tine the material into complex shapes using high temperatures and pressure, with the system allowing producers to utilize advanced geometries and integrate recessed area for fixtures and threaded components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Particular impressive aspects of the new manufacturing process include its design flexibility and cost efficiency, and the crash behavior of the resulting composite parts &amp;ndash; parts that are about 75% lighter than traditional steel structures,&amp;rdquo; Evonik said in its press release. &amp;ldquo;Plus, the PulPress method also reduces costs by up to 60% compared to composite parts manufactured using established methods such as resin injection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automotive industry is increasingly using composite components in vehicles in an effort to reduce C02 emissions, fuel usage, and weight. Evonik said that the expense of manufacturing composite components has typically been limited to use to luxury vehicles, but the new PulPress method can simplify mass production of the components and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These advantages have already won over a large number of customers in the European automotive industry,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Sivakumara Krisnamoorthy, manager for new applications in Evonik&amp;rsquo;s Resource Efficiency unit, in a statement. &amp;ldquo;Molded parts made using PulPress will soon be going into mass production.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base material for the process, ROHACELL, is known for its temperature-resistant and lightweight properties, as well as its rigidity and strength, according to Evonik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik said the PulPress method will also be of interest to manufacturers beyond automakers, like aerospace components and sports equipment producers.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/news/images/15637895469_065426634a_z_0.jpg?itok=hagSLnSt&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;165&quot; alt=&quot;BASF Human Nutrition and Nuritas are teaming up to develop new peptide food ingredients that offer health benefits.

Image courtesy of Flickr user Michael Stern&quot; /&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newtrition.basf.com/&quot;&gt;BASF&amp;rsquo;s Human Nutrition business&lt;/a&gt; is partnering with Dublin, Ireland-based biotechnology company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nuritas.com/&quot;&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt; to discover and bring to market new bioactive peptide food ingredients that offer health benefits using the Irish company&amp;rsquo;s proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) and DNA analysis technology, the companies announced in Jan. 18 joint press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The ingredients that will be brought to the market are going to be truly life-changing,&amp;rdquo; said Emmet Browne, chief executive officer of Nuritas in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuritas&amp;rsquo; technology uses AI, deep computations, and DNA analysis to &amp;ldquo;rapidly and efficiently&amp;rdquo; predict and help utilize peptides within food, short chains of amino acids occurring naturally that can offer health benefits by signaling certain molecules in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first component of the deal gives BASF an exclusive, royalty-based license to commercialize one of Nuritas&amp;rsquo; existing peptides for use across a number of applications, the companies said in the release. The second half of the collaboration involves discovering new peptides based on health issues that offer strategic importance to BASF&amp;rsquo;s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We think Nuritas is bringing a truly unique and innovative approach in addition to the actual ingredient on the table,&amp;rdquo; said Francois Scheffler, head of BASF&amp;rsquo;s Global Human Nutrition and Pharma Solutions businesses in a statement. &amp;ldquo;Therefore our cooperation with them makes us as BASF an even stronger partner for our customers, to fully support them in delivering highly efficacious solutions under the Newtrition brand &amp;ndash; which means delivering the right nutrients to the right people at the right time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuritas was founded in 2014 by Dr. Nora Khaldi, a mathematician and computational biologist, to discover food ingredients that offer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moisture Analyzers Feature Enhanced Process Security</title>
    <link>http://www.powderbulksolids.com/article/Moisture-Analyzers-Feature-Enhanced-Process-Security-01-23-2017</link>
    <description>
          &lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2017-01-23T00:00:00-07:00&quot;&gt;January 23, 2017&lt;/span&gt;    

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/articles/images/moisture-analyzer-enhanced-mettler.jpg?itok=bxBr8XoT&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; alt=&quot;Mettler Toledo HX204 moisture analyzer &quot; title=&quot;Mettler Toledo HX204 moisture analyzer &quot; /&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;Moisture measurement is a necessary process step in many lab and production applications. However, choosing the right method is paramount to success. Selecting an inappropriate measurement method can cause costly errors, and poor selection may occur more often in situations where multiple persons use the same equipment. Rare or expensive substances are wasted and production may even be stopped based on the inaccurate result. Obtaining additional test samples can further hold up production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To improve processing and ensure SOPs are followed, Mettler Toledo has added enhanced user-rights assignment capabilities to the firmware embedded on its Excellence moisture analyzers HX204 and HS153. Method-assignment ensures that users only have access to the methods they need. In addition, the firmware allows shortcuts to be set up from a dedicated menu. This eliminates the time it takes to choose from a long list of methods and enables one-click initiation for better process security and productivity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With the update, SmartCal testing temperatures can also be assigned to users. This ensures that routine testing is also carried out accurately for additional process enhancement. The ability to connect to a network via Ethernet or WiFi also improves traceability by allowing a user to print test results on any dedicated network printer or catalog them on file servers. A freely configurable print strip allows operators to customize how results are displayed to create the most helpful documentation at the analyzer as well.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Overall, firmware 2.20 further enhances Mettler Toledo&amp;rsquo;s top-line moisture analyzers, which are known for delivering unmatched performance for applications requiring high measurement precision (with up to 0.1 mg readability for HX204). High precision for both the HX204 and HS153 are enabled by a hanging weighing pan and weighing cell. An intuitive interface and the upgrade of user-rights management helps to guarantee error-free operation.&lt;br /&gt;

    <link>http://www.powderbulksolids.com/news/Endress-Hauser-Obtains-Accreditation-for-Courses-01-20-2017</link>
    <description>
          &lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2017-01-20T00:00:00-07:00&quot;&gt;January 20, 2017&lt;/span&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;One of the largest instrument manufacturers in the United States, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.us.endress.com/&quot;&gt;Endress+Hauser&lt;/a&gt;, received accreditation as provider of continuing education units (CEU)s through the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET), the Greenwood, IN company announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Endress+Hauser is proud of our education programs which train instrument technicians and engineers from the process automation industry in important installation, programming and troubleshooting skills so that our customers stay on the cutting edge,&amp;rdquo; stated Jerry Spindler, Customer and Field Service Training Manager, Endress+Hauser. Spindler added, &amp;ldquo;Our partnership with IACET is a demonstration of our commitment to lifelong learning and high standards for all of our programs, and we are very pleased to remain with such a prestigious organization and the elite group of organizations that offer excellent continuing education and training programs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E+H&amp;rsquo;s accreditation lasts five years and will cover all courses provided and created during the period. Many state agencies and organizations that provide credentials recognize the CEUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are pleased to continue our relationship with Endress+Hauser as an Accredited Provider,&amp;rdquo; stated Lori Schnaider, president of IACET.&amp;nbsp; Schnaider added, &amp;ldquo;Endress+Hauser joins nearly 600 organizations around the globe that have had their programs audited by third-party continuing education experts to ensure the highest possible standards are met.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/news/images/gh_8572.jpg?itok=sbphOIDE&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;127&quot; alt=&quot;AkzoNobel&amp;#039;s new powder coatings facility in China.

          &lt;p&gt;A new &amp;euro;11 million powder coating plant was opened by AkzoNobel &amp;nbsp;in Chengdu, China, the company&amp;rsquo;s sixth facility producing powder coatings in the country, the Dutch company announced Jan. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The opening of our Chengdu production site will strengthen our position as the global leader and China&amp;rsquo;s largest powder coatings supplier,&amp;rdquo; a statement by Contrad Keijzer, a member of AkzoNobel&amp;rsquo;s executive committee that is responsible for its performance coatings business. &amp;ldquo;It will allow us to leverage the strong growth that we see in the western provinces of China, furthering our organic growth momentum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serving local automotive, construction, furniture, and IT industries, the new facility features equipment to fully recycle waste water generated in operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the company, the factory&amp;rsquo;s opening is a result of the Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s Western Development Policy, noting that many manufacturers are opening sites in the region, including a large car manufacturing center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are going through a rapid change in western China and that is generating more demand for our business,&amp;rdquo; said AkzoNobel&amp;rsquo;s Powder Coatings unit in north Asia. &amp;ldquo;The new Chengdu site is an important investment in the region and will enhance our support to local customers, particularly, particularly those in the automotive industry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkzoNobel is also constructing a facility billed as &amp;ldquo;the largest powder coatings plant in the world&amp;rdquo; in Changzhou, China with a projected opening in October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pneumatic Weigh Hopper with Fill/Pass Valve</title>

          &lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2017-01-20T00:00:00-07:00&quot;&gt;January 20, 2017&lt;/span&gt;    

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/articles/images/pneumatic-weigh-hopper-flexicon.jpg?itok=o2A3kxQK&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; alt=&quot;Flexicon introduces a new weigh hopper with a fill/pass valve.&quot; title=&quot;Flexicon introduces a new weigh hopper with a fill/pass valve.&quot; /&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;Flexicon introduces a new weigh hopper with a fill/pass valve for dilute-phase pneumatic conveying systems. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Suspended from three small-scale load cells, the gain-in-weight hopper delivers higher accuracy than loss-of-weight systems requiring higher-capacity load cells.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Single or multiple hoppers can be positioned along a common vacuum or positive pressure pneumatic conveying line for discharging of dry bulk solids into single or multiple process equipment, storage vessels, or downstream use points by weight. Downstream of the last fill/pass valve, the conveying line can be routed to the original material source point or into a dust collection device.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The system&amp;#39;s controller weighs a batch by changing the position of the valve, which diverts conveyed material into the hopper. As the hopper fills, load cells transmit weight gain information to a PLC. Once the batch weight has been reached, the valve redirects material away from the hopper. The controller then actuates a slide gate valve to open, discharging the weighed batch.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Rated for the pressure differentials associated with pneumatic conveying, the conical hopper is eccentric with a vertical sidewall to promote complete discharge of weighed materials for batching accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The unit is constructed of stainless steel finished to industrial or sanitary standards to suit virtually any chemical, mineral, plastics, or food processing application.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company also supplies flex-tube diverters, wye-diverters, plug diverters, and other line diverter configurations to optimize any pneumatic conveying system.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Mondelez Selling Vegemite, Other Brands to Bega Cheese</title>

          &lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;http://www.powderbulksolids.com/sites/powderbulksolids.com/files/styles/medium/public/news/images/5997076223_6e3ea9a405_z.jpg?itok=tZuRIfnt&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;165&quot; alt=&quot;Mondelez International is divesting from Vegemite and other grocery brands sold in Australia and New Zealand.

Image courtesy of Flickr user Gordon Wrigley&quot; /&gt;    

          &lt;p&gt;Ownership of Vegemite will return to Australian ownership after nearly a century with the $450 million AUD sale of most of Mondelez International Inc.&amp;rsquo;s grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Baga Cheese Ltd., the East Hanover, NJ company announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divestment enables the food company to focus on investments in the firm&amp;rsquo;s core snacks categories and &amp;ldquo;power brands&amp;rdquo; like Oreo cookies and Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, a press release announcing the pending sale said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re extremely proud of our history as the custodian of the Vegemite brand for over 90 years, transforming it from its local roots into a global icon that&amp;rsquo;s synonymous with Australia,&amp;rdquo; said Amanda Banfield, vice president of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan for Mondelez, in a statement. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a privilege stewarding this brand, which is found in almost every Australian household and is part of the fabric of the nation. As we continue to execute our strategic growth plan, with a keen focus on core snacks categories and global power brands, we&amp;rsquo;re excited to see Vegemite and these much-loved brands continue to grow and thrive under Bega&amp;rsquo;s ownership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale includes the Mondelez-owned brands Vegemite, ZoOsh, Bonox, and a number of other Kraft brand products sold under license from peanut butter to parmesan cheese. The American food company will retain the Philadelphia brand in Australia and New Zealand while licensing out the Dairlea brand for use in the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ownership of a manufacturing site in Port Melbourne will move to Bega Cheese, with 200 employers slated to be &amp;ldquo;offered roles on comparable terms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe these iconic brands alongside the Bega Cheese brand are strong building blocks to enable Bega Cheese to become a great FMCG business,&amp;rdquo; said the Australian company&amp;rsquo;s chief executive officer Barry Irvin in the Mondelez release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close within several months, the firms said.&lt;/p&gt;
