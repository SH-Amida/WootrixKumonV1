      <itunes:summary>Americaâs first power plant was built in Manhattan. The first transmission of electricity occurred between Niagara Falls and Buffalo. And the first public power organization was founded in New York State.

Today, that power provider, the New York Power Authority -- or NYPA -- is working to digitize the stateâs grid end-to-end. Weâll talk with NYPA CEO Gil Quiniones about his push to create a "digital foundry" where the next generation of electricity inventors and innovators can re-imagine the grid.

In the second half of the show, Katherine Hamilton gives us an update from the World Economic Forum, where thinkers from all across the globe are also re-imagining the energy system -- while also grappling with a new world order in the wake of America's election.

Make sure to come to our live show on February 3 in New York City. We'll be at the Columbia Energy Symposium debating the latest developments in energy and cleantech: http://www.cuenergysymposium.com/

      <itunes:summary>For years, researchers have been working behind the scenes to improve autonomous vehicles. And all of a sudden that work is playing out in a very public way.

Top tech companies and automakers are testing new models on the streets, talking bullishly about fleets of self-driving cars, and thinking about how to combine electrification with automation. Meanwhile, regulators and city planners are trying to keep up with the pace of technological change. This year will likely mark the beginning of the commercial autonomous car era.

Will that era bring sweeping efficiency improvements to the transportation sector? Or will it result in a chaotic, overcrowded hellscape for our streets? The decisions we make today will determine our fate. In this week's show, we'll talk with Joshua Goldman, a senior policy analyst for clean vehicles at the Union of Concerned Scientists, about those two potential futures.

In the second half of the show, weâll examine Uberâs attempt to help city planners by opening up some of its data. And weâll discuss President Obama's article in Science magazine arguing that the clean energy transition is "irreversible."

Itâs been such a crazy 12 months for news that weâre packing it up and saving our energy for 2017.

Throughout the year, we've discussed every big story impacting the industry -- bankruptcies, acquisitions, legal challenges, the bloodbath in the public markets, new products, and, yes, the election of Donald Trump. 

Before we call it a year, we are strapping on our seat belts one last time and taking you with us on a ride through the twists and turns of 2016.

We'll kick off with a look at Trump's picks of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, former Texas Governor Rick Perry for Energy Secretary, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

And then we'll discuss our other top stories in federal policy, state policy, international developments, business deals and technological improvements. Finally, we'll launch our Predict-O-Meter for 2017. 

Endless thanks to our devoted listeners. We'll be back in early January.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>It's often said that electric vehicles are the key to bringing back load growth for utilities in the U.S.

But maybe thereâs another way: Marijuana.

After the November election, seven states and the district of Columbia have now legalized marijuana for recreational use. In the early states that legalized, energy use is already growing.

In Washington State and Colorado, where marijuana has been legalized for years, utilities are seeing a spike in electricity consumption. In Denver, for example, cannabis growers account for 2 percent of electricity use. In Washington State, grow operations could suck up more electricity than electric cars over the coming decades.

This may pose challenges to utilities, which are seeing increased outages and may have trouble addressing cannabis head-on because of the conflict between state and federal laws. It also presents an opportunity for serving a new class of customers.

This weekâs guest has been watching all of this play out. This week, we're talking with Tim Hade, the co-founder of Scale Energy Solutions, about the energy impact of marijuana legalization. He'll also talk about the financial opportunity -- and risks -- in managing that energy use.

In the second half of the show, weâre going to discuss the legal, cultural and environmental motivations behind the Dakota Access pipeline protests that are rocking North Dakota.

Weâll end with a quick discussion about what comes next for Tesla now that it has acquired SolarCity.

      <itunes:summary>Two weeks after the election, we have more clues about how president-elect Donald Trump may form a domestic energy policy and position America against the rest of the world on climate.

But mostly we're dealing with speculation -- bits of insider information from the transition team, some new hires, and some deeper portraits of the people guiding Trumpâs early energy policy. There are way more unknowns than knowns.

That doesnât mean thereâs a lack of things to talk about. There's been a lot of compelling reporting over the last couple of weeks on the new world for energy, cleantech and the environment.

Like last week, we're going to focus only on Trumpâs energy and climate policy. The Gang was joined by Lisa Friedman, the editor of E&amp;E Publishingâs ClimateWire, who helps us sift through the Trump's transition team picks, his statements about climate diplomacy, and the role of the business community in the next administration.

      <itunes:summary>Whether or not you agreed with the top-down, government-centric, executive-level strategy of the Obama Administration -- it was, arguably, America's only federal political path forward on decarbonization.

President-Elect Donald Trump plans to rip up that path as soon as he enters the White House. So how and where will he create a new one?

This week, weâre trying to figure out what Trump's win means for the energy industry broadly â and what it means for the business of clean energy specifically.

We fielded many questions from our listeners on Twitter yesterday. They asked about the Paris climate deal, domestic carbon regulations, renewable energy tax credits, coming legislation, and the role of states. So weâre going to break from our traditional format and try to address as many of them as possible.

Back in August, Elon Musk broke into SolarCity's earnings call to make a surprise announcement: Tesla and SolarCity were designing a building-integrated solar product.

"It's a solar roof as opposed to a module on a roof," said Musk. 

Just a few weeks earlier, Tesla went public with its intentions to acquire SolarCity. The solar roof was seen as an example of what the combined companies could create, market and sell.

"We don't want to show all of our cards right now, but I think people are going to be really excited about what they see," said Musk.

Their cards are now on the table after Musk unveiled the solar roof last Friday. The product was stunning -- but Tesla failed to release any substantive details about cost, performance, financing, or its business model for deploying solar roofs. (Given that very few building-integrated PV companies have actually succeeded, the lack of details was particularly fishy.) 

In this week's podcast, we dig into all the knowns and unknowns about Musk's mysterious solar roof. Does this represent a radical new business opportunity? Or is it just glitzy PR designed to convince investors of Tesla's plan to buy SolarCity?</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Dreaming, designing, building and deploying new kinds of hardware is tough in any business. But in the energy business, where change comes particularly slow, developing new tech is an especially hellacious undertaking. All of our segments tie into this theme.

Weâll start off by talking with Emily Reichert, the CEO of Greentown Labs, a hardware-specific cleantech incubator. Weâll talk about where entrepreneurs tackling this space are finding the financial and human capital to get them to scale. 

Then weâll turn to the ongoing saga of SolarCity. The company made a big bet on solar manufacturing last year â and new developments suggest that the decision to make its own solar panels was the wrong one.

Finally, the solar industry in general is undergoing a lot of turmoil â particularly in manufacturing. Weâll broaden the discussion to talk about why solar producers are struggling, and why the solar industry may be facing a bloodbath in 2017.

We'll talk with David Roberts, a writer with Vox, about the strange battle within the environmental left over carbon pricing.

Then, we'll turn to the hacked emails from Hillary Clintonâs campaign. They also show a tense relationship between left-leaning environmentalists and centrists like Clinton.

And finally, weâll discuss a landmark global treaty to slash HFCs. Itâs another win for global diplomacy and the Obama Administration. But will a Republican Senate ratify it?

      <itunes:summary>We are at the beginning of one of the greatest economic and consumer behavior experiments ever seen in the energy sector. How do we refine pricing in order to rapidly transition our aging, centralized grid to a clean, decentralized one? 

And can we do it so that we limit the economic losers, pay for the fixed costs of operating the grid, and make everyone whole?

Itâs a complicated question. The range of actual rate design options â decoupling, minimum bills, demand charges, fixed charges, and time-of-use â offer so many varying benefits and drawbacks.

Everyone agrees that weâre moving to a distributed grid. But thereâs a lot of disagreement on how to pay for it.

That is what weâre tackling in the show this week. Weâre joined by Lisa Wood, the executive director of the Edison Institute for Electric Innovation, and Ralph Cavanagh, a senior attorney with the National Resources Defense Council. 

Their perspectives on rate design are featured in a new report from the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, called "Recovery of Utility Fixed Costs: Utility, Consumer, Environmental and Economist Perspectives."

This week, we're talking about what consumers are looking for when solar shopping.

We'll talk with Vikram Aggarwal, the CEO of EnergySage, about the company's latest Solar Market Intel report that tracks buying habits and sales tactics. We'll explore the trends covered in the report. 

Then, we discuss South Australiaâs state-wide blackout. Was wind power to blame?

And finally, New York Cityâs solar market is taking off. Now it wants to do the same for storage. How did the city turn its solar market around so quickly?

      <itunes:summary>Last night, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton squared off on the presidential debate stage -- coming face-to-face for the first time in the campaign. 

Almost immediately, the candidates debated over energy and climate change. 

Clinton started the debate with a direct swing at Trumpâs climate denial and dismissive comments on renewables. 

âSome country is going to be the clean-energy superpower of the 21st century.Â Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real,â said Clinton.

Trump swung back with an an awkward attempt to conjure up Solyndra, the government-backed solar company that went bust in 2011.

âShe talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one,â said Trump.

In the days leading up to the debate, more details emerged on Trumpâs energy transition team. And during the debate, voters got a few additional hints at his worldview. This week, weâre going to square Trumpâs stances on energy with, well, reality. 

Then, weâll have an update on Obamaâs signature climate rule that is now stuck in court. 

Finally, GM is getting ready to roll out its 2017 all-electric car, the Bolt. Is this the affordable EV weâve all been waiting for?

      <itunes:summary>Renewables like wind and solar are largely not linked to oil prices. But there are markets where the success of renewables is more closely tied to oil: islands.

Or, more specifically, small island developing states, which make up 20 percent of UN member countries.

These small island states are dangerously dependent on diesel -- causing energy prices to fluctuate wildly and forcing many people into fuel poverty. That makes them perfect candidates for renewables.

In this week's show, we talk to Leslie Labruto, director of the islands energy program at the Clinton Climate Initiative, about why opportunities in island markets are expanding, even in the face of low oil prices.

Then, a pivotal moment for nuclear. After much scrutiny, the UK government approved the 3.2-gigawatt Hinkley Point C nuclear expansion. We'll discuss this historic test case for the competitiveness of nuclear.

Finally, a pivotal moment for Americaâs solar industry. Weâll dig into a debate about where the countryâs biggest solar lobbying group needs to turn its attention.

Julia Pyper, GTMâs senior reporter, joins us for the discussion.

In Nevada, weâll look at the continued fallout after the decision to end net metering last December. 

In California, weâll discuss the unprecedented amount of activity on climate and energy at the end of the legislative session.

And in Florida, weâll talk about the ballot initiative battle that has pitted the stateâs utilities against a broad coalition of solar supporters.

Between 2000 and 2014, the World Bank Group alone invested $63.5 billion in electricity access. But we still have more than 1.5 billion people without access to energy services. What is the disconnect?

This week, we'll talk about one of the biggest institutional barriers to energy access â- why multilateral development banks are not set up to solve energy poverty quickly. 

We'll talk to Aaron Leopold, the deputy director for global advocacy at the Power for All campaign, about how to speed up energy access by changing the way we think about traditional investment.

Then, are prominent business journalists willfully ignoring the growth in U.S. clean energy jobs?

Finally, America is now dealing with its first set of climate refugees in Alaska and Louisiana. A sign of things to come?

That coincided with record installations, record generation and continued improvements in technology design.

All of those trends were documented by our guest, Ryan Wiser, a senior scientist at Berkeley Lab, along with his colleague Mark Bollinger. In this week's show, we'll talk with Wiser about record installation numbers, technology improvements, and the competitiveness of wind after federal tax credits phase out.

      <itunes:summary>A growing number of businesses are using behind-the-meter batteries to cut utility fees. In the U.S., the commercial storage market is still small (36 megawatts in 2015) but it is growing quickly for demand charge management. 

And it is now starting to grow beyond anchor markets like California, New York and Hawaii.

In this episode, we look at how use cases for commercial and industrial battery storage projects are getting more attractive. Ravi Manghani, the director of GTM researchâs storage practice, joins us for the conversation.

Weâll also going to talk about some new offerings from up-and-coming storage providers, and talk about how Teslaâs planned acquisition of SolarCity would impact C&amp;I storage.

      <description>A growing number of businesses are using behind-the-meter batteries to cut utility fees. In the U.S., the commercial storage market is still small (36 megawatts in 2015) but it is growing quickly for demand charge management. 

And it is now starting to grow beyond anchor markets like California, New York and Hawaii.

In this episode, we look at how use cases for commercial and industrial battery storage projects are getting more attractive. Ravi Manghani, the director of GTM researchâs storage practice, joins us for the conversation.

Weâll also going to talk about some new offerings from up-and-coming storage providers, and talk about how Teslaâs planned acquisition of SolarCity would impact C&amp;I storage. 

This episode is brought to you by ABB Automation &amp; Power World.Â 

ABB has a virtual conference coming up in September, calledÂ Risk, Reliability &amp; Recovery. ThisÂ freeÂ online event will focus on the real-world solutions to the challenges that utilities face: shrinking budgets, aging assets, new regulations and a host of new distributed energy assets.

      <itunes:summary>SunPower founder Dick Swanson is an icon in the American solar industry â- an elder statesman, if you will. 

Swanson led groundbreaking solar research in the 70s, experimented with all kinds of solar cell types, broke efficiency records, and helped make SunPower one of the most successful solar companies of all time. 
Oh, and heâs also known for Swansonâs Law â even though he didnât actually create the law. 

In this bonus episode of the Energy Gang, we feature a wide-ranging conversation with Swanson about the early days of solar research, the difficulties in building a solar manufacturing business, and what the future holds for photovoltaics.

Weâre more than a decade on from the beginning of the cleantech gold rush -- and a lot of venture capital firms failed to strike it rich. 

In this week's show, we tally the boom and bust in cleantech VC, and look at how it compares with other sectors. We're joined by Varun Sivaram, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Ben Gaddy, the director of technology development at the Clean Energy Trust. 

The two recently teamed up with another colleague, Frank OâSullivan from the MIT Sloan School of Management, to log the performance of venture investments in clean energy and materials from 2006 to 2011. They then compare it to the medical field and software.

They found that the failure rate in cleantech was much higher (and the returns were much lower) than these other fields. Their conclusion: venture capital is not the right model for revolutionizing the energy industry. 

So if thatâs true, what should take its place? We debate. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Last week, Tesla Motors dropped âmotorsâ from its name, and is now calling itself just Tesla. This is an indication that the electric car company is thinking about much more than cars. And Elon Musk went way beyond indicating a shift â he explicitly spelled it out in his new master plan, published last Thursday.

His first master plan, published in 2006, described the company we know today: build an expensive electric car, improve manufacturing, build a less expensive car, grow manufacturing, and finally build a mass market EV. While Tesla hasnât always hit Muskâs ambitious timeframes, it is on a path to achieving his original vision.

Part two is much more ambitious. It includes building a seamless solar-plus-storage offering, dominating grid-scale storage, revolutionizing busses and tractor trailers, and making shared fleets of autonomous vehicles available to all.

As Musk described in his post: âStarting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared.â

So is his latest plan idiocy cubed? Or the right amount of Muskian ambition at just the right time? In this week's podcast, we dissect the plan.

Then, we'll discuss energy in campaign politics. Weâll look at Hillary Clintonâs pick of Tim Kaine for vice president, and examine Donald Trumpâs relationship with fracking tycoon Harold Hamm.

Finally, weâll take the pulse of regulators, who debated how to grapple with distributed resources at a big meeting this week.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>At this weekâs Republican National Convention in Cleveland, the GOP doubled down on its commitment to coal -- calling it âan abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource.â

Coal can get cleaned up. But it comes at a steep price. And that price can make it hard for even the most ardent supporters to get behind carbon capture and sequestration in practice.

Earlier this month, the New York Times published an investigation on the Kemper Power plant, a carbon capture and sequestration project supported by the stimulus that is billions of dollars over budget and still not in service. Securities regulators are investigating the use of government funds, ratepayers in Mississippi are suing Southern Company, and now a whistleblower has released thousands of documents showing that Southern Company covered up its problems and lied about timelines.

This is the latest blow to the clean coal industry â which detractors say will never materialize. This week, we'll talk about what Kemper means for the future of carbon capture and sequestration in the U.S.

Later in the show, we'll provide some context to an FBI investigation into the 2014 Arizona Corporation Commission elections. And we'll end with a discussion about NextEra's failed bid to acquire Hawaiian Electric Industries.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Will Tesla acquire SolarCity? Yesterday, news broke that Teslaâs board offered to buy SolarCity for roughly $2.5 billion. While shareholders and financial analysts don't seem to like the proposed deal, Elon Musk says it's a pivotal part of his long term plan.

      <description>Will Tesla acquire SolarCity? Yesterday, news broke that Teslaâs board offered to buy SolarCity for roughly $2.5 billion. While shareholders and financial analysts don't seem to like the proposed deal, Elon Musk says it's a pivotal part of his long term plan.

Then, in a related conversation, weâll ask whether nuclear needs to be included in state-level renewable energy mandates.

      <itunes:summary>Two years after Michael Polsky moved from Soviet Ukraine to the U.S. in 1976, America passed a law allowing independent developers to own power plants. He knew he needed to get in on the action.

Polsky eventually became one of the most successful energy developers of all time -- building multiple successful businesses around cogeneration, natural gas and wind.

Polsky is now the president and CEO of Invenergy, a company with nearly 14,000 megawatts of wind, solar, natural gas and energy storage projects operating or under construction in the U.S., Canada and Europe. He joins us this week to talk about what he foresaw before most others -- and what he sees as the future of energy.

      <itunes:summary>Nevada Power is likely doing a lot of soul searching.

Last week, two of the biggest Las Vegas casino companies -- MGM Resorts and Wynn â filed to leave Nevada Power and set off to buy wholesale electricity on their own. MGM has particularly strong renewable energy goals, and this move signals that the company thinks it can procure clean electrons cheaper than the utility.

As more large corporations make similar moves, will it lead to a financial disaster for utilities? This week, we'll discuss the implications with Cory Honeyman, the associate director of GTMâs US solar research practice, who has been following the commercial customer class closely.

Then, Exxon rejects shareholder demands on climate. Weâll look at the latest salvo over the oil giantâs carbon accounting. And we will end on a low note. Lake Mead, Americaâs biggest reservoir serving over 20 million people in the West, hit its lowest level ever. Are water wars on the horizon?</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>This year, GTM Research is forecasting that 66 gigawatts of PV capacity will be installed around the world -- a 21 percent increase over last year. But next year, capacity will only expand by 4 percent. In fact, without some of the top markets like India, America and China, the global solar market would likely retract next year. 

Meanwhile, Yingli Solar -- once the world's top producer of solar modules -- is having trouble paying back its loans and may be approaching bankruptcy. Why is the company doing so poorly while most other leading manufacturers are healthy?

In this week's show, we'll talk with Mohit Anand, GTM Research's senior global solar analyst, about the ups and downs for PV around the globe. 

In the second half of the show, we'll talk about the controversy over shoddy labor practices at a Tesla contractor. And we'll finish by discussing the latest in the political war over solar in Nevada.

      <itunes:summary>The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is changing the way people think about operating financial markets and banking systems. Meanwhile, distributed energy is changing the way people think about running grids. Can the two influence one another?

Many experts believe that the blockchain -- the public database that tracks Bitcoin -- will be the catalyst for the distributed, transactive grid.

This week, we'll talk with Paul Brody of Ernst &amp; Young about how the blockchain can be applied to energy and the internet of things. We'll describe how blockchains work, why they're useful, and when they'll start influencing the energy business.

In the second half of the show, we'll discuss concerns about rolling blackouts and too much renewable energy in California. We'll end the show by talking about a controversial proposal to give away millions of free solar kits in Kenya.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Many are billing Tesla's Model 3 launch as an iPhone moment. If the hype and pre-orders are any indication, the boutique electric vehicle manufacturer has indeed taken another step toward transforming the auto industry.

But could the Model 3 also be a Blackberry moment? If sales don't live up to expectations and Tesla faces any sort of quality control issue, it could take a big hit. And there are plenty of incumbents looking to fill Tesla's role.

In this week's show, we'll talk about the meaning of the Model 3 with Dana Hull, a Bloomberg business reporter covering Tesla and SpaceX. 

In the second segment, we'll ask how consumers can better protect themselves from fraud or poor investments in home solar systems. And we'll finish with a conversation about James Hansen's latest dire (and controversial) warning on climate change.

Make sure to come to our live show in New York City on May 4. We'll be joined by Yuliya Chernova of the Wall Street Journal and Chris Martin of Bloomberg for a discussion of the hottest topics in energy and cleantech.

      <itunes:summary>Amazon upended book publishers and brick-and-mortar retailers. Is it about to upend solar installers too?

Two months ago, GTM researchers stumbled upon a patent filed by Amazon for a drone-based solar installation system. After an extended investigation, we've confirmed that the company is working on the technology as part of its broader drone-based package delivery service. Amazon already has FAA approval to pilot the drones, and plans to roll out the service within two years.

If Amazon is successful, drone-based solar installation could completely change the way consumers buy solar. In this episode, we'll outline how the service will work and what impact it may have on the installation business.

      <itunes:summary>Utilities are often criticized for not connecting deeply enough with their customers. In a world where choice is becoming more important -- turning ratepayers into dynamic consumers -- power companies need to offer a wider range of services and communications outlets.

One way to better connect: use more consumer-friendly language.

According to a report in the Huffington Post this week, the Edison Electric Institute recently hired a marketing expert to help member companies better message themselves. 

âThey view us a monopoly, no incentives to serve the customers. They view us as stuck in the past in terms of technology," said PR guru Michael Maslansky in a presentation to the EEI board this January on consumer focus groups. "We need to be able to think about something sustained, something repetitious, something ongoing.â

Is this just a public relations ploy to improve the image of utilities? Or is it a serious attempt to engage with customers? We'll discuss in this week's show.

In our second segment, we'll talk about the Energy Information Administration's new report defending its forecasting and data gathering. Finally, we'll discuss a new analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showing that America can technically get 39 percent of its electricity from rooftop solar.

      <itunes:summary>It wasn't just science that got Eli Lehrer to accept the reality of climate change. It was insurance markets. As a free-market expert on insurance policy, Lehrer realized many years ago where the industry models were headed. 

"Every modeling firm used by the insurance industry acknowledged climate change is real. If markets have the ability to aggregate information, then either markets don't work or climate change is real. My judgment is that markets work and therefore climate change is real," says Lehrer.

In 2012, Lehrer founded the R Street Institute, a think tank devoted to spreading free market principles. In recent years, he's become a libertarian thought leader on environmental protection, carbon pricing and, most recently, the distributed energy transition. In this episode, the gang talks with Lehrer about how to make these issues more palatable to the political right.

In our second segment, we'll talk about a new consumer poll on rate design and subsidies for solar. We'll end the show with a look at United Airlines' big biofuels announcement.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>America is undergoing a second wave of storage growth. The first wave came between 2011 and 2013, when grid-scale projects backed by the government stimulus came online.

The second wave is based largely on two applications for lithium-on batteries: frequency regulation and demand charge management. These two applications helped the U.S. storage market grow 243 percent in 2015, according to the new Energy Storage Monitor from GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association.

In 2020, Americaâs energy storage market will be 28 times bigger than it was in 2015. This third wave of growth, says GTM Senior Storage Analyst Ravi Manghani, will be catalyzed by a broader range of revenue streams as regional wholesale markets get more sophisticated. In this week's show, we'll look at the trends behind America's storage surge. 

In the second segment, we'll talk about China's war on coal. In the last segment, we'll discuss the consequences of Vivint's decision to kill an acquisition agreement with SunEdison.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>ARPA-E, the government agency founded in 2007 to support R&amp;D in cutting-edge energy technologies, has invested $1.3 billion into power electronics, new solar materials and novel battery chemistries over the years.

According to the agency, the private sector has already responded with $1.25 billion in follow-on funding. Much of that money is going toward technologies that will help enable a distributed, responsive, renewable grid. 

In this week's show, we're joined by Jeff St. John, GTM's senior grid reporter, for a discussion on ARPA-E's grid edge strategy. How's it working?

Later in the show, we'll have an update on the drama surrounding Exelonâs $7 billion bid to acquire Pepco. Is the deal dead?

      <description>ARPA-E, the government agency founded in 2007 to support R&amp;D in cutting-edge energy technologies, has invested $1.3 billion into power electronics, new solar materials and novel battery chemistries over the years.

According to the agency, the private sector has already responded with $1.25 billion in follow-on funding. Much of that money is going toward technologies that will help enable a distributed, responsive, renewable grid. 

In this week's show, we're joined by Jeff St. John, GTM's senior grid reporter, for a discussion on ARPA-E's grid edge strategy. How's it working?

Later in the show, we'll have an update on the drama surrounding Exelonâs $7 billion bid to acquire Pepco. Is the deal dead?

We will end by talking about a WTO ruling against Indiaâs local content requirements for solar. How will it impact the countryâs burgeoning solar market?

But are these issues really that big of a deal for the maker of smart home devices? Weâll dissect the speculation about "internal problems" and ask whether recent bugs will impact Nest's position in the market.

Then, weâll look at what the sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia means for President Obamaâs climate plan. Weâll end with a heated conversation about whether solar is really capable of helping developing countries leapfrog the grid.

      <itunes:summary>In 2012, Wired magazine ran a prominent feature on why "the cleantech boom went bust." A couple years later, after a slew of venture investment failures in the industry, 60 Minutes ran a major story on "the cleantech crash."

The stories were widely criticized by cleantech experts as incomplete or inaccurate (the Energy Gang even ran its own critique of the 60 Minutes story). But they did reveal some hard truths: venture investors lost a lot of money on clean energy investments. There was indeed an investment bubble -- and it popped.

Over the last couple of years, investors have taken on a more capital-lite, software-dominant approach to cleantech. But now some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley are taking on one of the most capital-intensive industries of all: automobiles.

So what are we to make of the venture investment climate? This week, we'll talk with Katie Fehrenbacher, a senior writer at Fortune, about trends she's seeing in the sector.

Later in the show, we'll take a look at SunEdison's latest troubles. And we'll end with a discussion about the recycling industry's economic woes.

      <itunes:summary>Opower has evolved a lot over the years. The software provider started with a simple efficiency solution for utilities, and has since deepened its analytics and moved into demand response, billing, segmentation and customer care. 

One thing has stayed the same over the years: Opower firmly believes that the utility will be the arbiter of the distributed grid. 

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with Opower CEO Dan Yates about the promise and perils of selling software to utilities. Heâll also discuss why he believes strengthening utility interactions with customers will be crucial for realizing a renewables-heavy grid.

Later in the show, weâll discuss Hawaiiâs decision to slash net metering. And weâll wrap up with a preview of the Paris climate talks -- will an agreement be reached?

      <itunes:summary>At a time when Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are criticized for their lack of ambition to create world-changing ideas, Elon Musk has emerged as a hero to many.

Like Steve Jobs, Musk is both loved and reviled for his unwavering commitment to his vision. That vision: power the world with solar, make electric cars the dominant form of transportation, and revolutionize space travel. 

Some believe Musk is overhyped. Others think he's a savior of American manufacturing and innovation. Who is the man behind the myth? And how does run his companies?

In this episode, we'll talk with Bloomberg Businessweek writer Ashlee Vance about his new book, "Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future." Vance describes Musk's leadership style, ambitious goals, and potential legacy.

Later in the show, we'll discuss ISIS hacking attacks on the U.S. grid. We'll finish the show with a look at how Canada's new prime minister may influence climate and clean energy policy.

      <itunes:summary>When a slew of leading developers started forming YieldCos in 2013, they were hailed as a revolution in renewable energy financing. Not so much anymore.

After enjoying a long surge in stock pricing, YieldCos have come crashing down -- some falling as far as 50 percent in value since July. Why did they all see such a dramatic reversal all at once? Is it that YieldCos are inherently risky? Or was there just an irrational exuberance that has leveled out?

We'll answer those questions in this episode. We talk with finance expert Tom Konrad about how YieldCos are structured, why they were overvalued, what a market correction looks like, and whether they still represent the future of financing renewable energy projects.

Lots of supporters and analysts think the targets are too weak. Many now worry that the government created a rule so fragile that it could break down with a modest change in the energy mix. 

The reason: existing nuclear has been left out. In this episode, we'll talk with energy analyst Jesse Jenkins about why maintaining nuclear plants is vital to keeping Obama's climate rule from collapsing. 

Later in the show, we'll talk about the fight over demand response that hit the Supreme Court this week. We'll also look at how energy and climate were discussed during the Democratic presidential debate.</itunes:summary>

With solar business models still so new, there a lot more room for many more startups to emerge as the next behemoths in the industry. But can software companies do it?

In this episode of The Interchange, weâll talk with Emily Kirsch, the co-founder and CEO of Powerhouse, an incubator and accelerator dedicated to the distributed solar industry. Sheâll discuss where she sees the greatest opportunities for growth.

Weâll talk about why Powerhouse is so focused on software companies, hear about common mistakes made by entrepreneurs pitching their companies, and discuss some alternatives to venture capital.

This is partly due to the rapid adoption of smart phones, which give companies cheap ways to interact with customers and monitor their energy consumption. It's also due to the success of laying energy services on top of home security packages, cable and internet packages, and solar contracts. So who will emerge as a winner in the space?

Solar costs are on a strong downward trajectory. But competitiveness is a moving target.

High levels of PV on the grid forces wholesale prices downward, potentially making the technology less competitive over time. At the same time, subsidies for the industry will likely continue to fade away. So what will it take for solar to become resistant to these forces?

In the first episode of The Interchange, Stephen Lacey and Shayle Kann talk with solar expert Varun Sivaram, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, about the technology and rate design improvements needed to keep PV growth strong.

      <itunes:summary>In the mid 1970s, Exxon invested millions of dollars into sophisticated climate research and determined that greenhouse gas emissions would warm the planet to dangerous levels if left unchecked.

But then something changed. In the mid 1980s and into the 90s, Exxon curtailed much of that research and started sowing doubt about the reality of the problem. By one tally, Exxon has spent $30 million supporting front groups and climate denying politicians in order to prevent action on reducing carbon emissions.

Why such a dramatic reversal?

In this episode, we talk with Neela Banerjee, a reporter with Inside Climate News, about a lengthy investigative series she's co-writing on Exxon's conflicted climate past. (Make sure to read part one, part two and part three of the Inside Climate News series.)

Later in the show, we'll look at the good and bad pieces of California's latest climate and clean energy bill. And we'll end with a discussion of trends from Solar Power International.

      <itunes:summary>In 2012, Shell ventured up to the Arctic to drill exploratory offshore oil wells. A lot went wrong.

Its containment dome failed, a ship ran aground, another vessel was threatened by ice, one of its contractors was fined for safety violations -- and after all that, Shell never completed its exploratory drilling operation.

The company has spent $7 billion to explore for oil in Arctic waters. And with a new plan of attack and fresh approval from the Obama Administration, Shell plans to spend $1 billion every year to get access to the region's rich reserves.

In this episode, we look at the environmental, economic and political risks that Shell faces as it searches for oil in the Arctic. We'll also ask if its money could be better spent on harnessing energy resources beyond petroleum.

Later in the show, we'll talk about how Hurricane Katrina influenced the environmental justice movement over the last 10 years. And we'll end with a discussion about steep feed-in tariff cuts for solar in the UK that business say will destroy the industry.

      <itunes:summary>Behind-the meter battery storage is experiencing strong growth in the U.S. But with only 6.4 megawatts of capacity installed in 2014, companies have barely touched the marketâs potential. 

Stem is one of a handful of companies leading the deployment of distributed batteries in commercial and industrial buildings. The company has since raised $75 million from a range of high-profile investors, and it is set to install about 10 megawatts of behind-the-meter battery systems this year.

In this weekâs show, Stem CEO John Carrington joins us to talk about why behind-the-meter storage is taking off, and where the economics and applications are headed. Carrington brings years of experience in solar to the storage industry.

Later in the show, weâll discuss the governmentâs investigation of the Solyndra loan guarantee, which was finally released after four years in the works. Weâll end the show with a discussion about Warren Buffettâs energy investments.

      <itunes:summary>Until this week, most people thought Exelon's planned $6.9 billion acquisition of Pepco was a sure bet. But in a blow to both companies, regulators in the District of Columbia rejected the deal.What happened?

The story is not just about a business deal gone awry. Itâs a story about local empowerment, how utilities are dealing with the dramatic swing in Americaâs electricity market, and the tough decisions regulators are grappling with as they consider how to promote a cleaner grid.

We will talk to Anya Schoolman, an organizer in DC who opposed the deal, about how a group of citizens derailed one of the largest utility acquisitions in history. 

Later in the show, we'll examine how recent turmoil in the financial markets may impact energy markets. And we'll finish with a discussion of President Obama's latest announcement on PACE and loan guarantees.

      <itunes:summary>If thereâs any concept that can cut through politics of distributed energy, itâs âpersonal energy independence.â Some utilities may not like the idea, but many supporters believe itâs a helpful way to frame policies supporting solar, storage and microgrids, both nationally and locally.

That is what encouraged Senator Angus King (I-ME) to introduce a bill in Congress that would establish a nationwide integration plan for distributed energy. Called âThe Free Market Energy Act,â the legislation wouldnât mandate any specific technology; rather, it would direct states to establish rate structures and interconnection laws supporting on-site energy systems in a way thatâs fair to utilities and individual customers.

âItâs absolutely clear this is where the future is going and people are going to demand their own personal energy,â explained King, speaking on the Energy Gang.

This week, we talk with Senator King about his bill and discuss the politics of energy in Congress.

Later in the show, weâll explore the business opportunities in Latin America for solar companies looking to expand internationally. Weâll wrap up with a look at the politics of race surrounding President Obamaâs landmark climate rule.

      <itunes:summary>The Obama Administration finally completed its landmark climate rule that will require states to cut power plant carbon emissions. It's been hailed by supporters as historic, and demonized by opponents as an economic threat.

But is it really all that big of a deal? That depends on how you look at it.

In this week's show, we'll talk with Michael Grunwald, a senior reporter at Politico, who argues that the climate law is not very ambitious when it comes to carbon reductions. However, it will still be good for clean energy businesses, which will see new state markets open up because of the rule. We'll examine all the implications.

Later in the program, we'll look at why the U.K.'s Green Deal efficiency program failed, and ask if there are lessons for U.S. efficiency programs. In our last segment, we'll discuss the philosophy behind Bill Gates' billion-dollar investment in clean energy.

      <itunes:summary>Pretty much everything bad that could happen to the coal industry is happening.

Global coal demand is slumping; low natural gas prices and competitive renewables are shifting the energy mix in America; and a slew of regulations are causing plants to close at an unprecedented rate.

Since 2012, more than 40 U.S. coal companies have filed for bankruptcy. And just this week, Peabody Energy, one of the largest coal firms in the world, reported $1 billion in quarterly losses.

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with Taylor Kuykendall, a coal reporter with SNL, about all the factors contributing to coalâs demise.

Then, weâll discuss new grid rules in California that will allow companies to aggregate distributed resources and bid them into wholesale electricity markets.

And weâll end with a look at Hillary Clintonâs proposed plan to install 140 cumulative gigawatts of solar in America by 2020.

This podcast is sponsored by ReneSola, a Tier 1 solar cell and module manufacturer with a decade of experience in the cleantech industry.

      <itunes:summary>SunEdison is on a mission to become one of the biggest energy companies in the world â built entirely on renewables.

It still has a ways to go. SunEdison has a $9 billion market capitalization. The two biggest oil companies, PetroChina and ExxonMobil, are worth $376 billion and $342 billion respectively. And Duke Energy, Americaâs largest utility, has a market cap of $50 billion.

But with a slew of billion-dollar acquisitions of wind and solar companies â most recently Vivint Solar -- SunEdison believes it is on the path to rivaling the worldâs supermajors.

"We are building the next generation of the biggest energy companies on earth," said Julie Blunden, SunEdison's chief strategy officer, this week after announcing plans to buy Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion.

In this weekâs show, we will discuss SunEdisonâs business strategy and ask if the company is on a sustainable growth path.

In the second half of the show, weâll talk about a new report showing renewables outpacing nuclear power, and look at a scientific study of climate records that were shattered in 2014.

Last week, Australia abruptly changed its national policies for renewables, upsetting project development plans. And in June, Spain proposed yet another tax on storage systems to discourage self-consumption.

In this episode, weâll talk about the turmoil and Australia and Spain, and look at the consequences for politicians and the renewable energy industry.

Weâll finish up by debunking a new report from the Taxpayerâs Protection Alliance claiming that the solar industry is causing a bubble similar to the housing bubble that caused the 2008 financial crisis.

      <itunes:summary>By the end of the decade, the solar industry could be installing 135 gigawatts yearly â more capacity in 12 months than all cumulative installations over the last four decades.

The 2020 solar market will look much different today. It will be defined by fewer subsidies, greater geographic diversity and more sophisticated business models.

This week, weâll talk with Adam James, a senior solar analyst at GTM Research, about some of the most interesting findings from his new global demand report.

Later in the show, weâll discuss the Supreme Court ruling against the EPAâs mercury and air toxics rule for power plants. Weâll wrap up with a look at leading residential installer Sunrun as it prepares to go public.

      <itunes:summary>After Pope Francis issued his strongly worded encyclical on climate change and the environment, many wondered how it would influence skeptical conservatives.

It didnât take long to get an answer. âI donât think we should politicize our faith,â said Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, who brushed off climate change as an inherently political issue.

So what would it take to get Republicans more engaged on climate and cleantech?

This weekâs guest, Vox staff writer David Roberts, believes change wonât come from some kind of utopian post-partisan framework. 

âThe other strategy is to beat the other side. If you canât win them over, you beat them. For some reason, the whole idea of winning as opposed to transcending partisan battles is alienâ to progressives, said Roberts.

Weâll talk with David about the difference between âconservatism of the mindâ and âconservatism as it existsâ in energy policy.

Later in the show, weâll discuss the importance of the Popeâs encyclical on the environment. And weâll wrap up with a look at underperforming concentrating solar power plants in Arizona and California.

      <itunes:summary>Richard Kauffman has a lot of responsibilities as New York's "energy czar."

He oversees multiple agencies and utilities, advises the governor on energy issues, and works closely with regulators in their attempt to build a new electricity market based on distributed resources.

"Often the entities are diffuse and everyone is in their own silo. The benefit we have [in New York] is to develop and implement an integrated energy policy," explained Kauffman on the Energy Gang.

This week, we'll talk with Kauffman about the state's unique approach to energy policy. We'll also talk about how he's trying to use markets -- not top-down government programs -- to stimulate change in the electricity sector.

Later in the show, we'll debate the significance of EPA's report on groundwater contamination from fracking. To wrap up the show, we'll ask how much Australia overpaid for its solar boom.

      <itunes:summary>We measure energy use with a commodity-based approach -- monitoring electrons, therms and gallons. But is there a better way to gauge the efficiency of the economy?

Energy Economist Skip Laitner has been exploring a new method based on measuring "exergy," which shows that America's economy is only 14 percent efficient. And he says it's getting less efficient every year.

In this week's show, we'll talk with Laitner about why measuring usable energy is better for understanding economic productivity. And we'll ask: how do we apply it to the real world?

Later in the program, we'll discuss the state of the storage industry. And we'll look at why America's flagship clean coal project in Kemper, Mississippi is so delayed and over budget.

      <itunes:summary>Whether the solar industry likes it or not, more regulated utilities in America are going to propose owning residential PV systems themselves. It's a controversial development.

At our recent Solar Summit in Phoenix, GTM's Stephen Lacey and Shayle Kann hosted a debate on the following motion: "Regulated utilities should be allowed to own and rate-base residential solar."

Lon Huber, a former advisor at Arizona's ratepayer advocate and current director of Strategen Consulting's government and utility program argued in favor of the motion.

Court Rich, a senior partner at the Rose Law Group, argued against the motion.

      <itunes:summary>Over the last few years, analysts and academics worried about peak oil have been on the defensive.

The fracking revolution has brought an abundance of oil and gas that no one thought possible a decade ago. So we can declare peak oil dead, right?

Chris Nelder, an energy analyst whoâs written extensively on the subject has a simple answer: no.

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with Nelder about predicting the messy oil market, and get his thoughts on the long-term viability of unconventional fossil fuels.

Later in the show, weâll talk about Bank of Americaâs decision to phase out its coal investments. And then weâll finish with a discussion of Hawaiiâs plan to get 100 percent of its electricity from renewables.

      <itunes:summary>Ahmad Chatila worked in the chip industry for 18 years before taking over as CEO of the semiconductor manufacturer MEMC in 2009.

As a veteran of the industry, Chatila well understood the difficulties of the silicon wafer business. Semiconductors are a commodity, and the company was facing intense pricing pressure from Chinese competitors. So he decided to make MEMC an energy company -- zeroing in on SunEdison as an acquisition target.

Nearly seven years after the acquisition, SunEdison is branching out beyond solar and into wind, battery storage, microgrids, and is eyeing hydro and even natural gas. The development arm became so important to the health of the company, MEMC adopted the SunEdison name in 2013. 

So how does Chatila see the business evolving?

In this bonus episode of the Energy Gang, we feature an interview with Chatila on project development strategies, emerging markets, battery storage and vertical integration. We'll also talk about the megatrends that excite him most -- and also make him most nervous when it comes to competition.

      <itunes:summary>Wind has become a favorite target for politicians and conservative action groups looking end energy subsidies. But industry leaders are hitting back, saying theyâll only consider dropping the production tax credit when oil and gas lose their tax benefits.

But does it need the subsidy? The average price for U.S. wind contracts is now 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Some argue that the industry would remain competitive even without the PTC, and could avoid boom-bust cycles if it were eliminated.

In this episode, Tom Kiernan, the CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, joins us to defend the industryâs stance on tax credits. Heâll also talk about some key economic and technology developments in the sector.

Then, we take a look at the Ecomodernist manifesto, a new document from a group of academics, scientists and analysts outlining a human-based approach to environmentalism they call the âgood Anthropocene.â

Finally, we turn to the devastation in Nepal and ask whether distributed renewables can play a more prominent role in disaster response.

      <description>Wind has become a favorite target for politicians and conservative action groups looking end energy subsidies. But industry leaders are hitting back, saying theyâll only consider dropping the production tax credit when oil and gas lose their tax benefits.

But does it need the subsidy? The average price for U.S. wind contracts is now 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Some argue that the industry would remain competitive even without the PTC, and could avoid boom-bust cycles if it were eliminated.

In this episode, Tom Kiernan, the CEO of the American Wind Energy Association, joins us to defend the industryâs stance on tax credits. Heâll also talk about some key economic and technology developments in the sector.

Then, we take a look at the Ecomodernist manifesto, a new document from a group of academics, scientists and analysts outlining a human-based approach to environmentalism they call the âgood Anthropocene.â

Finally, we turn to the devastation in Nepal and ask whether distributed renewables can play a more prominent role in disaster response.

      <itunes:summary>In 2014, after a two-year dip in global clean energy spending, investors poured $310 billion into solar, wind, storage and energy efficiency.

Although yearly investment levels are below what IEA estimates are needed to address climate change, the increase shows that appetite for funding companies and projects is increasing. Some believe the investment figures prove that fossil fuels have already lost the long-term race to renewables.

This week, weâll talk with Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, about what the global numbers tell us.

Then, weâll look at how renewables are factoring into the upcoming parliamentary elections in the UK.

Finally, weâll talk about why the White Houseâs Quadrennial Energy Review is so important for planning the future grid.

      <itunes:summary>In 2008, when Al Gore called for America to get 100 percent from its electricity from renewables in 10 years, he was widely mocked by opponents. Even supporters who understood it was a rhetorical point quietly knew how difficult it would be to achieve.

But suppose the timeframe were stretched out to 2050. Would it really be that crazy? Some models show itâs possible; skeptics say the models are widely unrealistic.

This week, in place of the Energy Gang, we feature a debate between two experts on the issue.

Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University faces off against Eric Dennis, a senior fellow at the Center for Industrial Progress.

The two men will debate the following motion: âAmerican can, and should, get 100% of its energy from renewables by 2050.â

      <itunes:summary>Last March, NRG CEO David Crane wrote a passionate letter to investors.

âThere is no Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google in the American energy industry today,â lamented Crane.

His plan, he said, was to make NRG the company âthat enables the consumer to make their own energy choices.â

Months later, Crane broke the electricity supplier up into three parts: NRG Business, NRG Home and NRG Renew.  The Home arm of the business now includes retail sales, residential solar, residential EV charging and home energy management. 

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with the new CEO of NRG Home, Steve McBee, about his plan to double revenues through energy customization and consumer empowerment.

Later in the show, weâll discuss a new report from the Rocky Mountain Institute about the economics of âload defectionâ caused by solar-plus-storage.

Weâll wrap up with a conversation about Californiaâs severe drought. Are tech entrepreneurs ignoring an opportunity to address a crisis in their own backyard?

Theyâre cheaper, safer and more flexible than traditional light-water reactors. But many small modular reactor designs are also not fully proven on a commercial scale â and theyâll likely not achieve scale for another decade.

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with Leslie Dewan, the co-founder and CEO of Transatomic Power, about what it will take to make nuclear 2.0 a reality. Sheâll discuss regulatory challenges, cost barriers and interest from venture capitalists willing to take on the risk.

      <itunes:summary>The federal investment tax credit has enabled dramatic growth in the U.S. solar industry. But its looming expiration in 2017 is causing some within the solar business to ask: will it still be needed to continue that growth?

The industryâs national lobbying group unequivocally supports an extension. President Obama supports a permanent credit. But some believe installers will still be able to compete in many markets, even when the credit goes to 10% for commercial and third-party owned systems and zero for everything else.

In this weekâs episode, Barry Cinnamon of Cinnamon Solar joins the Energy Gang to debate the necessity of the federal tax credit. He argues that it will destroy smaller installation companies like his, and talks about how to prepare for the change.

Later in the show, weâll explain why Germanyâs grid didnât implode during last weekâs solar eclipse. Then, weâll look at Senate Majority Mitch McConnellâs bid to stop EPA carbon regulations by lobbying state regulators and relying on arguments from a famous constitutional law professor.

      <itunes:summary>Nancy Pfund, the founder of DBL Investors, has supported some of the most successful modern clean energy companies, including Tesla, SolarCity, Powerlight and BrightSource. 

And unlike many other venture capital firms, DBL isnât backing down from some of the riskier, capital-intensive investments. Other portfolio investments include CIGS manufacturer Siva Power, and storage companies Primus Power and PowerGenix. The firm is now in the process of raising a third fund worth $300 million.

In this podcast, weâll talk with Pfund about what she looks for in company strategies, why Tesla and SolarCity have been so successful, and how sheâs trying to bust political myths about cleantech.

Later in the show, weâll debate a controversial new working study from Georgetown University economist Arik Levinson that concludes Californiaâs energy efficiency policies did little to lower the stateâs energy use. We discuss that study and counter-arguments from efficiency advocates.

Finally, weâll look at whatâs behind SunEdisonâs acquisition of Solar Grid Storage.

      <itunes:summary>When the 114th Congress assembled for the first time in January, a bill approving Keystone XL was first on the agenda.

By passing that bill with numerous amendments stuff in, Americans got a hint of what energy issues the Republican-controlled House and Senate would address in 2015. Those include efficiency standards, tax reform, natural gas exports and EPA regulations.

This week, the Energy Gang is on break. In place of our normal show, we present a roundtable discussion between GTM Senior Editor Stephen Lacey, Huffington Post Energy Editor Kate Sheppard and E&amp;E TV Managing Editor Monica Trauzzi on what we can expect from Congress this year.

This podcast is sponsored by Kaco New Energy, a leading manufacturer of solar PV inverters for every size and module type.

      <itunes:summary>Former Congressman Bob Inglis has a tough job. As one of the only prominent Republicans talking about climate change, heâs been trying to give the rest of his party the courage to offer conservative solutions to the challenge.

Three years after founding the Energy and Enterprise Initiative, thereâs still a deep freeze in Congress on climate issues. But Inglis is gathering more allies in his fight for a carbon tax, and believes that the 2016 elections will force national candidates to recognize the challenge.

In this weekâs podcast, weâll talk to Inglis about changing dynamics in the Republican party. Weâll also discuss how tribal politics and local fights over âenergy libertyâ are impacting momentum.

Later in the show, weâll assess earnings from a few leading solar companies, and talk about the proposed YieldCo from First Solar and SunPower. Finally, examine about how race is becoming a factor in the rhetorical skirmishes over rooftop solar.

      <itunes:summary>The case against fossil fuels is simple. Oil, coal and gas have been an extraordinary gift of nature that allowed modern society to flourish. But now, because of extreme climate risk and the competitiveness of renewable energy, we can (and must) leave those resources in the ground.

But Alex Epstein believes that argument is too simplistic.

In his new book, âThe Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,â Epstein argues that fossil fuels are unfairly demonized. Pointing to positive trends in economic growth, pollution control and climate deaths â helped by energy abundance â Epstein says that fossil fuels should be celebrated, not disparaged.

This week, weâll interview Epstein and discuss the merits of his arguments. 

Then, later in the show, weâll ask whether ratepayers should be funding PG&amp;Eâs new electric vehicle charging project, and check in with the ARPA-E Innovation Summit.

      <itunes:summary>For some conservatives, solar is a big green boondoggle promoted by a liberal president to benefit rich environmentalists. 

But for a growing number of libertarians and conservatives, solar is also seen as a tool for promoting competition in electricity markets and empowering consumers. 

In this weekâs podcast, weâll talk with Debbie Dooley, founder of the Green Tea Coalition and Conservatives for Energy Choice, about why Tea Partyers are rallying behind solar PV as a way to expand personal freedoms.

Then, weâll discuss a new report concluding that Europe overpaid $100 billion for its renewable energy capacity. And weâll wrap up the show with a look at a secret automated car sharing service from Google that is reportedly designed to rival Uber.

      <itunes:summary>If the war of words between SolarCity and Arizona Public Service is any indication, this year will likely see an escalation in tension between the solar industry and utilities throughout the U.S.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that APS was behind a letter from members of Congress to the Federal Trade Commission asking the government to investigate the sales practices of solar services companies. 

SolarCity hit back immediately and published a scathing blog post calling out APS for using so-called âmonopoly moneyâ to influence politics at the highest level in order to limit consumer choice. 

In this show, weâll look at APSâ claims and tactics, SolarCityâs response, and ask what it means for coming clashes between solar installers and traditional power companies.

Later in the podcast, weâll look at the highlights of President Obamaâs trip to India, and then discuss problems in Chinaâs domestic solar market.

      <itunes:summary>Last year, 200,000 residential solar systems were installed in the U.S. More than two-thirds of those systems were third-party financed through leases or power purchase agreements. 

But third-party financing is peaking. As solar costs come down, more consumers demand direct ownership of their own systems and installers look for simpler options, a growing number of lenders are coming into the U.S. market with loan products.

Will they rival leases and power purchase agreements? Not in the short term. But they are becoming much more popular â sparking debate around their value for customers.

This week, weâll talk with Sungage Financial CEO Sara Ross, who will provide background on the evolution of solar loans and talk about the democratization of solar finance.

Later in the show, weâll discuss the State of the Union address and look at the surge in solar jobs outlined in the Solar Foundationâs solar census.

      <title>Is it Time to End Subsidies for Wave and Tidal Energy?</title>

      <itunes:summary>Progress in wave and tidal energy hasnât been slow â itâs been nonexistent. 

Despite media attention, strategic investments from large energy companies and strong support from national governments, the marine renewables industry has seen mostly technical failure over the last decade. 

According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, fewer than 150 megawatts of wave and tidal projects will be installed globally by the end of the decade -- a 72 percent reduction in earlier projections.

Aside from creating dams, no companies have yet been able to competitively and reliably tap the waves or tides for electricity.

So is it time to end support for marine renewables and spend money on more promising up-and-coming technologies?

In this weekâs show, weâll look why companies operating in the space have struggled and ask whether itâs finally time to shift our attention.

Then, weâll discuss the increasingly important role of electric vehicles at the Detroit Auto Show. Weâll also talk about âOne Knob,â an idea for creating a more free-market approach to residential energy efficiency.

      <description>Progress in wave and tidal energy hasnât been slow â itâs been nonexistent. 

Despite media attention, strategic investments from large energy companies and strong support from national governments, the marine renewables industry has seen mostly technical failure over the last decade. 

According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, fewer than 150 megawatts of wave and tidal projects will be installed globally by the end of the decade -- a 72 percent reduction in earlier projections.

Aside from creating dams, no companies have yet been able to competitively and reliably tap the waves or tides for electricity.

      <itunes:summary>With oil prices dropping to five-year lows, pundits are pushing conspiracy theories about OPEC, public investors are acting irrationally, oil companies are going deeper into debt and political leaders are considering previously untouchable ideas like a gas tax. 

Meanwhile, many people are asking if an extended period of $50-per-barrel oil will compromise the economics of renewables.

In this weekâs episode, weâll address the spectrum of economic and political consequences from oilâs strong price slide. 

Michael Levi, a senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, joins us at the top of the show to chat about OPEC, the resiliency of Americaâs unconventional oil &amp; gas sector, the impact of low prices on consumers, and which renewable energy sectors will be affected first.

Later in the show, weâll talk about the renewed push for increasing the gas tax in Congress. Weâll also provide an update on the U.S.-China trade case that may bring good news for installers worried about the cost of tariffs on Chinese products.

      <itunes:summary>Three years after the political posturing around the Department of Energyâs clean energy loan guarantee program, some lawmakers still havenât moved on.

âWhat we have seen is incredible mismanagement, and itâs become the poster child for crony capitalism,â said Tennessee Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in an interview with Bloomberg last month.

Performance tells a different story. Even after a handful of early bankruptcies, the program has so far seen a 98 percent success rate. And losses from those bankruptcies are only one-fifth the cost of what Congress appropriated when establishing the program. 

âThe facts are clear, the results are in. You can continue to deny that, but I donât know what it gets you,â said Jonathan Silver, the former executive director of DOEâs loan programs office, speaking on the Energy Gang.

In this weekâs show, weâll talk with Silver about the Solyndra bankruptcy, the political reaction in Washington and the legacy of loan guarantees.

Later in the show, weâll discuss SunPowerâs investment in the home energy management company Tendril, and try to understand the global climate negotiations that just wrapped up in Peru.

Tesla is just beginning to expand beyond EVs and move deeper into grid-scale storage, behind-the-meter storage and solar-battery combination systems, potentially making it more than just a boutique automobile producer.

âEverywhere we look there's an opportunity for storage,â said Mateo Jaramillo, Teslaâs director of powertrain business development, speaking on this weekâs Energy Gang podcast.

In this weekâs podcast, weâre live at Greentech Mediaâs Solar Market Insight conference. Teslaâs Jaramillo and California Public Utilities Commissioner Michael Picker join us to discuss the emerging markets for battery storage, including synergies with the solar industry.

This podcast is brought to you by SMA, the world's leading solar inverter manufacturer. With more than 850 service experts, 90 service hubs, 30-plus gigawatts installed globally and thousands of commercial and utility projects completed worldwide, SMA is the partner of choice for your PV projects.

      <itunes:summary>Earlier this week, Germanyâs biggest power company, E.ON, announced that it would spin off its centralized power assets in order to make itself a distributed utility and embrace the ânew worldâ of energy. 

E.ON and other European utilities have been shedding billions of dollars as electricity consumption declines and solar erodes the value of their power plants. Many of them are considering radical changes to their business models as a result. 

Johannes Teyssen, E.ON's CEO and board chairman described the move this way: "Weâve now come to the conclusion that it will become increasingly difficult for a company with a broad portfolio to be successful and to grow in both the new and the conventional energy world.â

In this weekâs podcast, weâll look at why E.ON made such a dramatic decision. We will also discuss parallels in the U.S., where utilities are in the early stages of what German utilities have gone through.

Later in the show, weâll talk about Googleâs decision to ditch R&amp;D in renewable energy. Was it proof of the limitations of renewables? Or was it just Googleâs inability to make the right investments?

Finally, weâll wrap up with discussion of a new infrastructure-as-a-service company looking to recreate financing success in solar.

      <itunes:summary>Every decision for a startup is a financial decision. 

From hiring decisions to supply agreements, investors evaluate an entire company through a financial lens. But some entrepreneurs muddling along through challenges often fail to think about the growth of their company in this holistic way.

Thatâs what our guest, Kathrin Ohle, says in her new book, The Decision Makerâs Guide to Long-Term Financing.

This week, weâll have Kathrin on the show to discuss the mechanics of financing for entrepreneurs â including how to ensure you donât lose control of your company to investors.

Weâll also discuss the landmark climate agreement between the U.S. and China. Is it a dramatic breakthrough? Or is it an overhyped incremental step? 

Later in the show, weâll look at some clean energy themes coming out of the World Economic Forum.

This podcast is brought to you by SMA, the world's leading solar inverter manufacturer. With more than 850 service experts, 90 service hubs, 30-plus gigawatts installed globally and thousands of commercial and utility projects completed worldwide, SMA is the partner of choice for your PV projects.

      <itunes:summary>Depending on your perspective, Millenials are either the most globally aware, technologically savvy generation or the most distracted, dependent, self-obsessed generation.  

For many, those feelings about Millenials extend to the environment. Some criticize their surface-level engagement and say young people mistake Facebook âlikesâ and virtual signatures for actual action. Others believe Millenials are much more sophisticated about the environment, pointing to the surge in green MBAs and cleantech startups working to solve big problems.

In this weekâs podcast, weâll be joined by guest co-host Andrew Winston, author of âThe Big Pivot,â to debate the role of Millenials in the clean economy. 

At the top of the show, weâll discuss the correlation between corporate environmental strategy and rankings for the top-50 most innovative companies in the world. And then weâll also chat about how the elections may impact utilities around the country.

As operations and maintenance becomes a more important piece of the solar market, big project developers, independent contractors, software firms and inverter manufacturers are all trying to get in on the action. 

In this weekâs podcast, weâll talk with Chuck Smith, executive vice president of services at SMA America, about the companyâs approach to monitoring, analyzing and optimizing solar plants. (Disclosure: SMA is a sponsor of the podcast.)

Later in the show, weâll talk about a new proposal in San Antonio to phase out net metering and create a program based on competitive bidding. Weâll also discuss the legacy of Michael Peevey, the embattled outgoing president of the California Public Utilities Commission.

      <itunes:summary>SolarCity is a much different company than it was before it went public. It has made numerous acquisitions in an attempt to control nearly every part of the value chain â from hardware to customer acquisition â making it a fully vertically integrated solar provider.

Most recently, SolarCity acquired the high-efficiency solar manufacturer Silevo and broke ground on a gigawatt-scale production facility in Buffalo, New York. The company now has over 7,000 employees, a market cap of $5.3 billion and a 30 percent share of the U.S. residential solar market. 

The company is undoubtedly a success story. But can it continue growing sustainably in the long term? Can vertical integration actually work in residential solar?

This week, weâll talk with CEO Lyndon Rive about the SolarCityâs move into manufacturing, its new loan product, the outlook for U.S. policy and the way the company calculates âretained valueâ for investors.

Later in the podcast, weâll discuss the different business strategies of two leading independent power producers, NRG and Dynegy. 

Weâll also look at why the Nobel Prize in physics went to three inventors who created the first blue LEDs.

Most recently, SolarCity acquired the high-efficiency solar manufacturer Silevo and broke ground on a gigawatt-scale production facility in Buffalo, New York. The company now has over 7,000 employees, a market cap of $5.3 billion and a 30 percent share of the U.S. residential solar market. 

The company is undoubtedly a success story. But can it continue growing sustainably in the long term? Can vertical integration actually work in residential solar?

This week, weâll talk with CEO Lyndon Rive about the SolarCityâs move into manufacturing, its new loan product, the outlook for U.S. policy and the way the company calculates âretained valueâ for investors.

Later in the podcast, weâll discuss the different business strategies of two leading independent power producers, NRG and Dynegy. 

Weâll also look at why the Nobel Prize in physics went to three inventors who created the first blue LEDs.

      <itunes:summary>In mid-September, the U.S. government revised its estimates for U.S. oil production upward once again. Boosted by increases in tight oil from shale formations in North Dakota and Texas, America could soon surpass its previous domestic production peak hit in 1970.

At the same time, U.S. natural gas production, also driven by fracking, hit an all-time high this summer.

But skeptics warn that fracked oil and gas could soon hit a peak, pointing to the steep decline rates for wells â which both the oil and gas industry and the government admit. One prominent Canadian geologist and drilling consultant, David Hughes, recently released an analysis of these decline rates for the Post Carbon Institute, showing an 85 percent average drop in production at unconventional wells in the first three years.

However, total production is still growing. And the EIA suggests that a peak may not come for another couple of decades. What are we to make of these conflicting projections on the promise of fracking?

This week, weâll look at the future of fracking and ask what it means for cleantech investment.

Weâll also talk about the possible outcome of an IRS review of value of solar tariffs, and ask if any good came out of the recent UN climate summit and march in New York City.

      <itunes:summary>New York is taking a hard look at how to reform the distribution grid and encourage more distributed energy resources. But itâs not doing it through mandates. 

Instead, New York regulators are developing flexible market structures to encourage utilities to adopt a variety of new distributed technologies, while also empowering customers, creating new business competition and hardening the grid.

So how exactly will the model work? In this special live podcast, recorded at WNYCâs performance space in New York City, we spoke with two architects of the plan.

Audrey Zibelman, chair of the New York Public Service Commission and Sergej Mahnovski, director of Con Edisonâs utility of the future team, joined the Energy Gang to discuss why the state is so unique. 

âI donât want to create mediocre wires companies. I want to create excellent, innovative companies that have third parties wanting to come to New York and build businesses around DER because they see itâs a marketplace where they can be successful and then we can lead everywhere else,â explained Zibelman.

Utilities and city planners understand this problem and have targeted the commercial building sector by providing rebates for retrofits, deploying smart meters and establishing stricter building codes. But the ability to gather actionable insights into how buildings are performing are only now emerging.

In this podcast, weâll talk with FirstFuel CEO Swapnil Shah about how data analytics can change the building efficiency paradigm. Weâll also talk about the companyâs partnership with Opower, which will help the startup expand to more utilities.

Thatâs not an easy goal to achieve. The General Services Administration owns or leases more than 354 million square footage of buildings, which is enough space to fill half of Manhattan. It also manages a massive transportation fleet and must adhere to very strict cost requirements.

But the shift is happening. On this weekâs show, weâll talk with Ruth Cox, GSAâs senior sustainability officer, about how renewables and efficiency are greening government buildings while saving taxpayers money.

      <itunes:summary>Bill Gates is a very influential guy -- not just because he founded Microsoft, but because of his powerful foundation. With $40 billion in trust assets, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is one the biggest charitable organizations in the world focusing on global health, clean water, energy access and financing for entrepreneurs.

So when Gates writes on his blog that developing countries canât afford renewable energy, that carries weight.

Thatâs exactly what Gates did last week when he promoted the work of Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, writing that more fossil fuels are the moral choice in the fight against energy poverty.

Finding the right mix of resources for developing countries is a complicated exercise. But the economics of renewables are far better than fossil fuels in many cases. In this week's podcast, we'll talk about why Gates is wrong on the cost of wind, solar and other technologies.

Later in the show, weâll talk about a very important compromise in Mississippi that will bring lots of new solar projects to the state. And we'll also discuss the latest developments in the battle to stop coal exports in Oregon and Washington State.

This podcast is sponsored by eGauge Systems, a manufacturer of next-generation energy meters for solar generation and building demand, submetering, performance contracts, LEED projects and net zero buildings.

      <itunes:summary>In the academic world, thereâs lots of debate about how expensive or cheap renewables are compared to fossil fuels. But do they actually match whatâs happening on the ground?

In this weekâs podcast, weâll talk with Amory Lovins, the founder and chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, about the difference between the market reality of renewables and the economic debate about their cost.

      <description>In the academic world, thereâs lots of debate about how expensive or cheap renewables are compared to fossil fuels. But do they actually match whatâs happening on the ground?

In this weekâs podcast, weâll talk with Amory Lovins, the founder and chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, about the difference between the market reality of renewables and the economic debate about their cost.

In the second part of the show, we will discuss a very important legal decision upholding FERCâs grid planning rule. Weâll also chat about a booming application in the non-residential solar market: carports.

      <itunes:summary>Last week, hackers at the Black Hat conference showed how to jailbreak a Nest learning thermostat and override the firmware, taking it under their control. 

The hack itself cannot be done without physical access to the device, and Nest said no devices have been hacked maliciously. But itâs one of many recent hacks of connected devices in the home. 

So are we safe? 

In this podcast, weâll talk about the widespread security implications for consumers, businesses and utilities. 

Later in the show, weâll ask if the Environmental Protection Agency is being transparent enough as it crafts carbon regulations. Weâll also look at the continued struggles for concentrating solar power and ask if thereâs a future for the industry.

      <itunes:summary>How do we calculate the true cost of intermittent renewables? 

The levelized cost of wind and solar are falling by the day. But how cheap are they really? A recent study from the Brookings Institution concludes that they are higher than presumed when using a cost-benefit calculation.

In this podcast, we'll debate the merits of the Brookings study and ask what assumptions one should make when evaluating the cost of different technologies.

Later in the show, weâll talk about the debate over the Export-Import Bank Washington, and assess the impact of new tariffs imposed on Chinese solar products coming into the U.S.

      <itunes:summary>In the last couple of years, five nuclear power plants in the U.S. have been put on the list for closure. These plants are getting challenged from two sides: competitive natural gas and renewables are eroding the economics of merchant projects, while technical challenges associated with age are making the plants more expensive to operate.

Some are cheering the slow, creaky demise of nuclear in the U.S. But others warn that if more plants come off line, U.S. emissions are headed for a steady increase â potentially 4 to 5 percent. 

In this week's show, we'll look at whether renewables and efficiency are capable of filling the gap left by retired nuclear plants.

Later in the show, we'll talk about an infrastructure boondoggle in Australia that has raised rates there by up to 60 percent. Then, we'll look at how U.S. regulators are feeling about their role in meeting EPA carbon rules.

      <itunes:summary>Today, solarâs dominance feels inevitable. But in 1979, when Neville Williams started promoting the industry at the Department of Energy, it felt like a far-off dream.

That didnât stop the early pioneers from thinking big and pushing the government to invest in the early technology â helping solar module costs fall from $55 per watt in the 1970s to 50 cents per watt today.

In this podcast, weâll talk with Neville Williams about his new book, âSun Power,â that features stories from the last four decades in the solar industry. Williams was the founder of off-grid solar companies SELF and SELCO, and also founded the Maryland solar company Standard Solar.

In the second half of the show, weâll talk about big news in Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut. Weâll also discuss an example of shareholder activism that turned SunEdison around.

      <itunes:summary>Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson recently made a bold comparison between the financial risks that led to the 2008 economic collapse and emerging climate risks: "Weâre staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy. The warning signs are clear and growing more urgent as the risks go unchecked."

New data suggests that Paulson is correct. In this week's podcast, we'll discuss a landmark report, called "Risky Business," that assesses the vast economic risks of climate change. Kate Gordon of the Center for the Next Generation joins us to talk about why Republican capitalists like Paulson are sounding the alarm on climate change.

In the second half of the program, we'll talk about a new proposal for utility ownership of solar inverters. We'll also dissect a new GTM Research report on microgrid development in the U.S.

This podcast is sponsored by eGauge Systems, a manufacturer of next-generation energy meters for solar generation and building demand, submetering, performance contracts, LEED projects and net zero buildings.

      <itunes:summary>This week, SolarCity shocked the solar industry by announcing its intentions to acquire Silevo, and move quickly into cell and module manufacturing. America's largest solar installer now wants to be one of the most powerful producers of solar products. 

But does the move make sense?

In this week's show, we'll debate the technology risks and cost upsides of SolarCity's manufacturing play.

Then, we'll talk about Elon Musk's decision to open up all Tesla's patents. Finally, we'll ask why oil companies are divesting from renewable energy.

      <itunes:summary>Itâs been a year and a half since Sandy destroyed the East Coast electric grid and left more than 8 million people without power. So has anything materially changed in the utility sector since October of 2012? 

In this weekâs podcast, we feature a discussion on Greentech Mediaâs new eBook about the legacy of the storm: âResiliency: How Superstorm Sandy Changed Americaâs Grid.â Weâll talk with Gary Rackliffe, VP of ABBâs North American smart grid business, about how power companies are thinking differently about grid modernization and smart technologies.

Then, weâll look at whether EPAâs new carbon rules are really all that ambitious. Finally, weâll talk about how 2014 is shaping up for the energy storage industry.

      <itunes:summary>In theory, solar PV is the ultimate democratized energy technology. But is it living up to its potential?

Historically, solar has been accessible to wealthy environmentalists, utilities and large corporations. But it has been less available to low-income people who most need relief from their rising utility bills. And while the industry fares better than others in diversity, it is still lagging in employment of women. So how can this be changed?

In this week's podcast, we'll talk with Erica Mackie, the CEO of GRID Alternatives, about the need to develop new models for making solar accessible to everyone. 

Then, we'll discuss what the recent court ruling against FERC Order 745 will mean for the future of demand response, and we'll debate the impact of a recent slew of Wall Street analysis warning about the decline of utilities.

The case once again raises concerns about the growing problem of corporate espionage in the clean energy industry, where companies are often targeted for their intellectual property. So will the Chinese government's hacking deter cleantech companies from operating in the country? 

In this week's podcast, featuring guest co-host Andrew Winston, we'll look at the implications of the Department of Justice case against Chinese hackers. We'll also talk about some big news coming out of conferences in the last two weeks within the efficiency and corporate sustainability sectors.

      <itunes:summary>Earlier this week, New York officials issued a report calling for structural changes to the way utilities are regulated. The proposal would make distribution utilities into Distributed System Platform Providers that get compensated for their ability to integrate clean energy, demand response and efficiency on the grid. 

It's a fundamentally new way to think about how power companies should plan for the future.

In this weekâs podcast, weâll look at what this historic proposal from New Yorkâs Public Service Commission will mean for renewables in the Empire State.

Weâll also discuss the regulatory standoff over PSE&amp;Gâs $3.9 billion grid hardening plan after Superstorm Sandy, and look at the impact of a new solar tax in Arizona.

      <itunes:summary>Could solar paired with battery storage make utilities obsolete? That's the question analysts are asking as the economics of the technologies improve.

The short answer is "no." Utilities operate an extremely valuable set of infrastructure and still benefit from legacy customer relationships. And the economics of grid defection are usually not favorable.

But it's an important question to ask, says Jon Creyts, managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, because it can guide how utilities manage future consumer empowerment. 

In this podcast, we'll talk with Creyts about Rocky Mountain Institute's latest report on"grid defection," and examine the different scenarios for solar and storage.

Then, we'll look at Exxon Mobil's response to the latest UN climate report, and talk about possible policy solutions for supporting new financing structures for clean energy projects.

With a tax credit expiration looming, conflicts over net metering and a brewing solar trade war, it is far from assured that this boom will go on forever. This week, weâll talk with Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, about how the industry is positioning itself in the face of these challenges.

Then, weâll talk about Opowerâs coming IPO and ask what it will take for the company to continue dominating the efficiency sector.

In this week's show, the Energy Gang will debate the consequences of the U.S.-China solar trade war. We're joined by solar expert Shayle Kann, who's been watching the case closely.

Also in the show, we'll discuss Tesla's plans for a battery mega-factory and the meaning behind its secret conversations with Apple. And finally, we'll ask whether the "valley of death" is getting any smaller for cleantech entrepreneurs.

Also in the show, we'll discuss Tesla's plans for a battery mega-factory and the meaning behind its secret conversations with Apple. And finally, we'll ask whether the "valley of death" is getting any smaller for cleantech entrepreneurs.

The Energy Gang is produced by Greentechmedia.com. The show features weekly discussion between energy futurist Jigar Shah, energy policy expert Katherine Hamilton and Greentech Editor Stephen Lacey.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEnergyGang/~4/JdxGntsDw00" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

This week, we'll talk with ARPA-E's director, Dr. Cheryl Martin, who describes how she thinks about developing groundbreaking energy technologies.

We'll also debate the solar industry's aggressive tactics used to hit back against utilities that are attempting to limit PV on the grid.

In this week's podcast, the Gang will look at some new business models for customer-sited storage, which include targeting buyers of solar PV.

We'll also look at the progress of California's cap and trade market one year after implementation, and speculate about whether President Obama's latest staff shakeup will influence energy policy.

The web is littered with conflicting opinion pieces on the German experience â some claiming the countryâs aggressive promotion of renewables is an oncoming economic disaster, and some saying those concerns are far overblown, if not totally false. So what are we to believe?  

In this week's show, we'll look at Germany's evolving relationship with renewables, the impact on electricity prices and the outlook for its nuclear phase-out.

Then we'll travel to Japan, which is undergoing a rapid transition after a sudden phase out of nuclear in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. We'll ask if the country can make up for the nuclear gap.

Finally, we'll travel to Ontario, where we'll look at the phase out of coal power and changes to the province's troubled feed-in tariff program.

      <itunes:summary>No one denies the immense potential of geothermal. Despite that potential, the industry has grown incrementally over the years and failed to attract strong investment flow, particularly in the U.S. 

So what's keeping growth so low?

In this week's podcast, the Energy Gang will look at the industry's two main problems: drilling risk and messaging. Both are holding back growth.

We'll also look at the challenges for another "forgotten renewable" -- solar thermal. And finally, we'll ask how ESCOs can continue expanding energy performance contracts for efficiency.

But we can't entirely blame the utilities for moving slowly; regulators play a key role in setting the rules for how power companies operate.

In this week's show, we'll look at a comprehensive new report aimed at these decision makers, called America's Power Plan, which lays the foundation for the future of electricity. 

We'll also discuss a few tremendous improvements in renewable energy economics, as well as the coming surge in Home Energy Management tools that are making houses into virtual power plants.

Then, we'll look at the political fight around Ron Binz, the man tapped by President Obama to run the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC is not usually in the news, but new fears about the death of coal are infusing Binz's confirmation with partisan politics.

The state is currently considering a bill that would make significant changes to electricity pricing structures that could eat into the value of solar. But the industry is cautiously backing the bill because it also extends net metering policies. The end result could have equally positive and negative consequences. We'll look at the entire picture, as well as parse the true value of solar on the grid.

We'll also discuss the viability and cleanliness of Bloom Energy's fuel cells, and talk about the slew of positive efficiency news in recent weeks.

The Energy Gang is produced by Greentechmedia.com. The show features engaging discussion between energy futurist Jigar Shah, energy policy expert Katherine Hamilton and Greentech Editor Stephen Lacey.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheEnergyGang/~4/ONNPropmkdM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>With a heat wave gripping the central and eastern U.S., concerns about the impact of water supplies on the power sector are growing. This week, the Gang will discuss a detailed new report looking at how to break the nexus between power generation and water consumption.

We'll also look at the factors behind the high cost of gasoline and their impact on the cleantech business. Finally, we'll look at another powerful study that makes a counterintuitive conclusion on the value of siting renewable energy in low-resource areas.

Then, we'll ask if a new agreement between the U.S. and China represents a positive shift in stalled climate negotiations. Plus, we'll debate whether the fossil fuel divestment campaign is a worthy or lost cause.
