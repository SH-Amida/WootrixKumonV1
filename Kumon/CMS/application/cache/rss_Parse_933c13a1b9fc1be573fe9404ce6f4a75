            <title>3 Lean Manufacturing Techniques You Need to Know</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/30/0ba838f4-9926-4e43-ad1d-dc2fad8414fa_lean-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 248px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;To make a manufacturing process more efficient, a company must understand what lean is. To &amp;ldquo;go lean&amp;rdquo; means your workplace applies lean manufacturing philosophy and practices. Lean is an industrial practice where manufacturing facilities focus on waste reduction to create more value for the customer. There are several different lean techniques, allowing each organization to fit lean into its own distinct production process. Three of the most common lean techniques are 5S, kaizen and kanban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 5S system is an organizational method that stems from five Japanese words: seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke. These words translate to sort, set in order, shine, standardize and sustain. They represent a five-step process to reduce waste and increase productivity and efficiency. The first step, sort, involves eliminating clutter and unnecessary items from the workspace. Next, workers must set in order by ensuring that there is a place for everything and everything is in its place. The shine step entails cleaning the workspace and regularly maintaining this state. Standardizing should be done to make all work processes consistent so any worker can step in and perform a job if necessary. The final step, sustain, involves maintaining and reinforcing the previous four steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Kaizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is a business practice that focuses on making continuous improvements. With kaizen, there is always room for improvement, and workers should constantly look to improve the workplace. This philosophy also emphasizes that each individual&amp;#39;s ideas are important and that all employees should be involved in the process to better the company. An organization that practices kaizen welcomes and never criticizes suggestions for improvement at all levels. This helps to create an environment of mutual respect and open communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanban relies on visual signals to control inventory. A kanban card can be placed in a visible area to signal when inventory needs to be replenished. With this process, products are assembled only when there is demand from the consumer, which allows companies to reduce inventory and waste. The kanban method is highly responsive to customers because products can be manufactured by responding to customer needs instead of trying to predict their future needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean manufacturing has many advantages, such as higher productivity, improved customer service, lower lead times, increased employee morale and a safer work environment. Each of these contributes to the most significant benefit of lean manufacturing &amp;mdash; increased profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/uaQ0JBYDfBY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>7 Lean Manufacturing Principles That Improve Training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/6/17/ffc0a4b3-4e47-40a8-8b28-7d62812245cf_training-web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 226px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Corporate trainers and lean manufacturing experts often work in the same places. At some sites, they share thoughts and ideas, each advancing the other&amp;rsquo;s cause and making progress together on shared projects. In other cases, though, they remain &amp;ldquo;siloed&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t have an opportunity to cross-pollinate. This is a shame because each can learn valuable tips from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll consider some lean concepts that can be applied to corporate training programs. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with lean, you know these concepts well, but maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t considered how they could relate to training. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with lean, you may find it offers some helpful ways to look at training material development and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Increase Value for the Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the foundational principles of lean manufacturing is to increase value for the customer. It can be tricky to determine the best way to do this, and that&amp;rsquo;s where lean expertise and methods play a role, but in most cases it&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to know who the customer is &amp;mdash; whoever is paying for the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those involved in developing and leading training should also strive to increase value for the customer. However, it can be easy to lose track of who that customer is. There really are two customers. The first is the worker who needs the training. The goal here is to do everything possible to help them develop the skills they need to excel in their job. The second is the employer who&amp;rsquo;s paying everyone&amp;rsquo;s paycheck, because ultimately training should always be directly aligned with helping the company reach a key business goal. So keep your training focused on your students&amp;rsquo; needs and know what business goal your training supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduce Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the ways lean manufacturers provide more value at less expense for their customers is by identifying and reducing waste in the production process. Trainers can learn a big lesson here, and it&amp;rsquo;s one that&amp;rsquo;s often neglected. All training materials should be designed to teach workers to perform a task, skill or other behavior on the job. Always identify that desired skill(s), develop learning objectives to match, and then only create training materials that directly support teaching your workers to satisfy the learning objective and perform the task on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If there&amp;rsquo;s something in your training materials that doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly support the learning objective or there&amp;rsquo;s something that is &amp;ldquo;nice to know&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;need to know,&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s waste and you should get rid of it. Likewise, your tests should only evaluate your workers&amp;rsquo; ability to satisfy the learning objectives. In training, less is more, and more is waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Go to the Gemba&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gemba is a Japanese word that roughly translates to &amp;ldquo;at the site&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the real area.&amp;rdquo; In lean, it means at the work area. Lean manufacturing gurus are big on going to the gemba because that&amp;rsquo;s where they can see what&amp;rsquo;s working and what&amp;rsquo;s not. Even better, they can take time to talk to workers, get to know them and get their opinions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trainers can benefit from going to the gemba, too. In the work area, you can get to know the employees better, find out what kind of people they are (this can help you develop better training materials for them), and watch them perform their job tasks. You can also check to see if they&amp;rsquo;re putting their training to work and can help determine if they need additional future training as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As previously mentioned, the workers you train are your customers in a sense. What better way to increase value for your customers than to go watch and talk with them at their work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Give Employees a Voice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s not just about watching employees. Lean manufacturers are committed to giving their employees a voice in helping the company reduce waste and become more efficient. Employees are actively encouraged to report waste and provide suggestions for efficiencies at work, and so they are active participants in the lean culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the same way, it&amp;rsquo;s important for trainers to give workers a voice in the training culture. Provide active training sessions that allow lots of practice as well as questions and answers. Let workers choose when training is held and what&amp;rsquo;s covered (as much as possible). Ask them what types of training they like best. Let them lead the training while you watch and listen in when you can. Use post-training surveys or other means to get your workers&amp;rsquo; opinions about the effectiveness of the training. The more actively you involve employees in their training, the more effective the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Map the Value Stream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean manufacturers diagram their production processes, including all the material, information and work flows, to analyze the current state as well as brainstorm more efficient future states. Trainers can do something similar by diagramming their training programs and looking for inefficiencies and waste. For example, look at the training someone in a given job must complete. Are there unnecessary redundancies? Are they currently completing training that they don&amp;rsquo;t need? On the flip side, is there training they need that they&amp;rsquo;re not getting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can also take a closer look at individual training activities. Again, look for unnecessary training, redundant training, missing training, etc. Remember, your goal is to minimize waste in order to increase value, with value being the learning necessary for workers to perform their jobs efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Create Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean manufacturers strive to create processes with &amp;ldquo;flow.&amp;rdquo; This means materials, information, workers and everything else move through the production process without interruption. As a trainer, your goal should be to create flow, too. You can do this by mapping your value stream and making sure you&amp;rsquo;re providing the right training, as already mentioned. Another way to do this is to focus on creating job aids and just-in-time training (JIT). Job aids are not truly training but are a supplement to your training materials. They are references that workers can check on the job to get information when and where they need it. For example, you could create a job aid that&amp;rsquo;s a table of codes needed by a machine operator and then post the aid by the machine so the worker can check it when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just-in-time training is training that&amp;rsquo;s delivered to workers immediately before they need it. You might provide it just before introducing a new machine to a work area. Delivering the training just before it&amp;rsquo;s needed is more effective than delivering it months earlier and hoping people will remember (which they won&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Aim for Continuous Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the single most fundamental concept of lean manufacturing is to continuously improve. Lean manufacturers never sit on their laurels and say &amp;ldquo;good enough.&amp;rdquo; They are constantly analyzing, evaluating and seeking employee insight to reduce waste, make their processes more efficient and provide more value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trainers can benefit from this same devotion to continuous improvement. Don&amp;rsquo;t just train workers and assume you&amp;rsquo;re done. Collect and analyze data from tests and on-the-job performance to see how your workers are doing and look for areas where you can improve your training. Keep reviewing your training materials&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;value stream map&amp;rdquo; to ensure you&amp;rsquo;re providing the right materials to the right workers at the right time. Also, continue learning the fundamentals of workforce training and add any new approaches you learn to your training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Corporate Training the Lean Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Workforce learning and development is a big field of study, and there&amp;rsquo;s certainly more to be said than what has been covered above. But if you have a level of familiarity with these lean manufacturing concepts, you should find it helpful to make sure these familiar concepts characterize your training program as well as your manufacturing processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CNH Industrial Plant Earns World-Class Manufacturing Designation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The CNH Industrial N.V. plant in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, has been awarded silver status for implementing world-class manufacturing (WCM), one of the highest standards for the integrated management of manufacturing plants and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Canadian plant, which produces planters, headers, air carts and other equipment for the company&amp;#39;s agricultural equipment brands, Case IH and New Holland Agriculture, is the first North American CNH Industrial facility to receive a silver WCM designation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following an audit by independent, trained auditors, the plant earned the silver award for achieving production process excellence and for the WCM knowledge demonstrated by employees throughout the facility and on the shop floor. The facility earned the status just seven years after initially implementing the WCM program, which measures technical and managerial standards, including safety, cost, environment, quality and process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a great honor, as our company is committed to achieving the highest standards in production in North America and around the world,&amp;quot; said Bret Lieberman, vice president of manufacturing for CNH Industrial North America. &amp;quot;Employee involvement is a vital aspect of any successful world-class manufacturing program. All of our employees in Saskatoon should be commended for their strong commitment and achievement in making CNH Industrial&amp;#39;s plants among the best in the world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on continuous improvement, WCM is an integrated system for managing all elements of an organization. It focuses on improving the efficiency of a company&amp;#39;s technical and organizational components while maximizing market competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The widespread use of WCM principles at CNH Industrial plants allows the entire company, totaling 69,000 employees across 190 countries, to share a common culture based on efficient processes and on a language universally recognized across all plants and countries in which CNH Industrial operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through precise methods and standards, WCM seeks to eliminate waste and loss from the production process by identifying objectives such as zero injuries, zero defects, zero breakdowns, zero waste, reduced inventories, and suppliers&amp;#39; punctual delivery of parts to plants and subsequently to dealers and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CNH Industrial has 59 plants around the world involved in WCM, with nine silver level and 18 bronze level plants. Currently, 83 percent of CNH Industrial plants (53 plants in all) participate in WCM, with 90 percent of the employees at those plants taking part in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Saskatoon plant, along with other CNH Industrial plants in North America, first implemented WCM in 2008. Since then, the facility has improved safety, achieved no lost-time injury for 3 million hours, reduced plant quality warranty claims by 90 percent, produced double-digit savings almost every year and not missed a delivery shipment in more than three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility, which employs 550 workers, is one of CNH Industrial&amp;#39;s 12 plants in North America and the only one in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Applying Lean Six Sigma Methodology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/27/6873fa37-762e-4c46-8be8-5ca82bc5e300_lean methodology.jpeg" style="width: 326px; height: 283px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;As the name implies, a lean Six Sigma methodology combines the principles of lean manufacturing (lean) with those of Six Sigma. But why would anyone want to do this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of combining lean and Six Sigma methodologies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Does Lean Contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a process of continual improvement based on increasing value for the customer. The objective is to eliminate anything that does not contribute to what a customer is willing to pay for. This puts the focus on eliminating waste and streamlining the process of delivering the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean involves applying a number of principles and methods that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kaizen &amp;ndash; The principle of continuous improvement based on employee suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kanban &amp;ndash; Customer demand &amp;quot;pulls&amp;quot; the product through the production process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TPM &amp;ndash; Total productive maintenance is used to reduce equipment downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TQM &amp;ndash; Total quality management continually improves product and service quality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5S &amp;ndash; Improving quality and efficiency through cleaning up and getting organized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SMED &amp;ndash; The principles of Single-Minute Exchange of Die reduce the time needed to change a machine or production line to produce a different product.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Poka-yoke &amp;ndash; Used to eliminate the possibility of errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a tool used by businesses to streamline manufacturing and production processes. The main emphasis of lean is on cutting out unnecessary and wasteful step so that only the steps that directly add value to the product remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Does Six Sigma Contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma is a quantitative method that focuses on improving quality in manufacturing using data collection and measurement, with the goal being to eliminate errors and variation. The result is improved product quality. Six Sigma addresses both the production and design of a product. The two approaches are represented by two acronyms: DMAIC and DMADV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMAIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DMAIC is the Six Sigma acronym for the five steps used to improve an existing process or product. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define the Project &amp;mdash; This is usually a problem to be solved. What are the goals, resources and limits of the project?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure &amp;ndash; Collect data about the current system or process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analyze the Data &amp;mdash; To find the root cause of the error.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve &amp;ndash; Design and implement changes that will eliminate the error. Some techniques that are used include design of experiments, poka-yoke and standard work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control &amp;ndash; Provide a system that allows monitoring and adjustments to maintain and improve on what was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMADV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		DMADV is the Six Sigma methodology used to improve an existing a product or service, or for the creation of a new product or service. The steps in DMADV are:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define &amp;ndash; Establish the methods to be used and the goals of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure &amp;mdash; Identify characteristics such as those that are critical to quality (CTQ), required capabilities, production process capabilities and limits, and potential risks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analyze &amp;ndash; Develop and test design alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Design &amp;ndash; Select the best alternative, based on customer requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verify &amp;ndash; Verify the design meets the goals of the project and make adjustments based on feedback and new data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many ways, the goals of lean and Six Sigma are similar, with lean having a broader scope and Six Sigma primarily focusing on eliminating errors and improving quality. However, both are based on a foundation of having a customer focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Synergism, Working Together in Lean Six Sigma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The differences in lean and Six Sigma are why they work together so well. For example, the two methods have similar goals, but they use different methods for identifying the root cause of waste and errors. Lean looks to optimize the production process. Six Sigma eliminates wastes that result from variations (errors) in the process. This means they can identify different types of deficiencies and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another difference is that lean is more of a bottom-up system, in which ideas for improvements (kaizen suggestions) flow up from the people doing the production work. Six Sigma is more of a top-down method employing experts to collect, analyze and act on data that is collected. This provides different viewpoints that will not only catch problems the other did not notice, but also come up with solutions the other had not considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma methodology is effective because the two methods complement each other, working together to identify errors and waste more efficiently than using just one method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Drawbacks of Lean Six Sigma Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are some possible drawbacks to the lean Six Sigma methodology. One of the most significant is that both lean and Six Sigma involve major changes to the workplace. For example, most lean implementations are not successful because management underestimates the amount of time and effort required to implement and maintain lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his book &amp;quot;Changing with Lean Six Sigma,&amp;quot; A. Aruleswaran writes, &amp;quot;The most significant challenge is to change people and their mindsets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not unusual for it to take more than two years to make the changes required just to implement lean. Implementing both lean and Six Sigma together means even greater complexity. If sufficient time and resources are not provided, the likelihood of failure is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s easy to hire consultants and pour resources into lean Six Sigma methodologies, thinking you&amp;#39;ll ensure success that way. While adequate resources must be allocated, the objective is not to spend a lot of money and waste resources. For example, Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa taught that 90 percent of all problems can be solved using simple graphical techniques he called the &amp;quot;seven tools of quality:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cause-and-effects diagrams (fishbone diagram)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Histograms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Check sheets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pareto charts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stratification (flow charts)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control charts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scatter diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Achieving the right balance to economically implement lean Six Sigma methodologies is a difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Possible Issues with Lean Six Sigma Methodologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At times, lean and Six Sigma may give conflicting answers. A system must be in place to resolve differences and address situations in which conflicting &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; are championed. Babe Ruth&amp;#39;s famous words apply when combining lean and Six Sigma: &amp;quot;The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don&amp;#39;t play together, the club won&amp;#39;t be worth a dime.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, lean Six Sigma methodology can result in using the wrong method for the problem being addressed. For example, Six Sigma is not appropriate for solving small problems that do not involve a significant number of variables. Lean techniques are much more efficient for solving these types of problems. Of course, this is also an advantage of lean Six Sigma methodology because both methods are available, and the best one or a combination of both can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Results of Lean Six Sigma Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the forward to the book &amp;quot;Changing with Lean Six Sigma,&amp;quot; V. S. Pandin writes: &amp;quot;Lean Six Sigma involves working on both the top line (revenue) as well as the bottom line (profits) of the enterprise. The attention to the top line is by being relevant to customer needs (voice of the customer), and the attention to the bottom line is through better quality, improved cycle times and lower costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying lean Six Sigma methodology throughout the workplace has a number of positive results, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Both methods bring a focus on customer value and can reinforce each other to achieve a high level of customer focus that delivers value to both the customer and the organization implementing lean Six Sigma methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste is an unnecessary cost. By targeting waste directly, as well as targeting variation and errors, waste is more effectively eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Problems of all types and sizes are brought to light. Root causes are identified, and the problems are solved in an effective and efficient manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Products and services are delivered virtually defect-free, economically and on time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste elimination, error elimination and a customer focus become the culture of an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Visual Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without clear, effective visual communication, implementing lean Six Sigma methods will be next to impossible. Visual communication using signs and labels delivers necessary information at the physical locations and times when it is needed most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/L9dKqGUqb2Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Material Handling Trends for 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/4/15/9b7bc152-eba5-4244-8977-bfb2620c0fe8_forklift.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 268px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;For those in the material handling industry, staying ahead of the game means not only having efficient operators (and forklifts), but also upgrading to new material handling tools and resources to outpace competitors in innovation and workplace productivity. Because 2015 is another competitive year for people in the material handling industry, warehouses and employers alike should educate themselves about trending material handling tools and leverage them to their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Robots on the Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From manpower to machine power, the forklifts you see driving around the warehouse may no longer have an operator on the seat. Automatic forklifts are designed to perform jobs without human operation. While robots in 2014 were made to unload packages from a machine and deposit them on a conveyor, the 2015 models are ready to pick out packages autonomously. As&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Modern Material Handling&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;reports, &amp;quot;The next evolution is robots that can replace people in mundane, labor-intensive and error-prone activities like picking pieces from a bin and into a tote in a pick zone and then moving that tote to a conveyor.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improved Safety and Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with developing robots that can perform human jobs with equal (or perhaps greater) efficiency and accuracy, innovations in the material handling industry will also place a heavy emphasis on workplace safety and productivity. For example, the invention of automatic height-adjusting carts have enabled operators to work at optimal heights without aids from electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic hook-ups. When it comes to new forklift attachments, pneumatic scissor lift and rotate systems can effectively eliminate the strains and hazards associated with handling a pallet and placing products into the pallet simultaneously. This invention optimizes workplace safety and worker ergonomics, allowing all forklift operators to safely manage multiple material handling processes with greater efficiency and precision. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Efficient Data Assessment and Management Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As companies seek to gain a competitive edge in the global economy, delivering accurate and efficient material handling services will become more important than ever. A number of automatic data-capture products have entered the market to help those in the material handling industry track work progress, record data and use it for future projections. Mobile voice computers enable operators to record data in frozen and refrigerated environments. Certain mobile dimensioning devices can seamlessly transfer measurement data using a complete parcel data profile. With these tools, warehouse employees can send information wirelessly from the forklift or floor to virtually anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As technology continues to make material handling safer and more efficient, employers in the industry are encouraged to find better ways to increase their talent-retention rate, upgrade their forklifts and accessories, and gain better control over their supply chain software and data systems. It&amp;rsquo;s all about doing more with less. The company that hits the jackpot first likely will find many golden opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/3_FXJ5t_8po" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Material Handling Systems to Improve Productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/4/1/2dc957a9-d743-473c-9596-b27029ccd759_honda_ohioplant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 313px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The material handling industry has undergone considerable change since the days when humans first realized they could move materials more easily by rolling them over logs. Complex manufacturing control systems have evolved to support the specific material handling challenges inherent in automotive assembly processes. However, the basic goals to eliminate waste and improve process efficiency remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The automotive industry was one of the first to rely on technology for the control and management of material handling and assembly operations. Originally, commercially available third-party applications were scarce, so most automotive companies either built their own systems or contracted to have them built specifically for their operations, processes and best practices. By today&amp;#39;s standards, these systems were built on antiquated architectures, but they evolved as the company grew by hard-coding the organization&amp;#39;s DNA within them. Unfortunately, progression of this nature makes it difficult and costly to upgrade or migrate to a more modern system. This type of application is not only outdated, but also lacks the required levels of flexibility to accommodate multiple assembly processes. Because many of the experts familiar with them have also retired &amp;ndash; taking their knowledge and expertise with them &amp;ndash;manufacturers are having even greater difficulty maintaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the years since these first systems were developed, competitive pressures &amp;ndash; fueled by consumer demands for better quality and increased customization &amp;ndash; have mounted within the automotive industry. This has led to the creation of lean manufacturing processes like kanban, which among other things, advocated just-in-time or just-in-sequence delivery of materials to the assembly line as a way to reduce or eliminate costly inventory. These processes forced suppliers further down the supply chain to either adopt similar processes or assume the cost and responsibility of holding extra inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increased product complexity and the need for more assembly process agility, such as the ability to run multiple products on the same line, have placed even more pressure on manufacturing control systems that are already struggling to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The net result has been an increased need for tighter collaboration and visibility up and down the supply chain. Because of interdependencies between supply-chain partners inherent to lean manufacturing processes, a minor error at a single supplier could quickly shut down an original equipment manufacturer&amp;#39;s (OEM&amp;#39;s) assembly plant until another source for the material or component was located or the problem was resolved. This co-dependence also placed additional burdens on companies further down the supply chain when last-minute changes to quantity or schedule were imposed upon them by their OEM customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To accommodate lean manufacturing processes, older legacy manufacturing process control systems needed the ability to seamlessly communicate with other enterprise systems. This was a daunting task for direct point-to-point integrations between these legacy systems. Furthermore, this integrated network of enterprise and manufacturing control systems had to be accessible from anywhere and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what&amp;#39;s an automotive manufacturer to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers now recognize the need to move to modern solutions because maintenance and development of the legacy systems has become an increasingly expensive burden. This extra cost locks up considerable capital that might be better used to fund new research and development projects or manufacturing capacity expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, modern solutions, often offered in the cloud or on premise, are now available that provide real-time visibility into end-to-end manufacturing processes, including information about jobs, labor, materials, machine status and product shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to providing the necessary line planning and balancing capabilities, such as assembly order sequencing, management and execution, these new systems easily integrate with enterprise systems for costing, order entry, planning and finished goods management. The best also provide built-in business intelligence with dashboards available on any mobile device so personnel can monitor the performance of shop-floor systems in real-time. Thanks to modern, visually appealing user interfaces, key personnel can &amp;quot;follow&amp;quot; specific operations, orders or events and receive text or email notifications the instant an anomaly is detected, a task is completed or an order is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these capabilities extend beyond the four walls of the manufacturer to provide insight across the entire value chain &amp;ndash; from consumer through the supplier ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These systems overcome the costly and time-consuming problem of migrating from decades-old legacy systems with the ability to import data from external systems such as product lifecycle management (PLM). They can also be used with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems from multiple vendors &amp;ndash; a capability commonly needed across the automotive supplier community as a result continuous mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While automotive suppliers stand to benefit the most from these next-generation manufacturing control systems, those with highly customized or variable product configurations like OEMs and specialty vehicle manufacturers can also expect significant productivity improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, when automotive Ferrari decided to aggressively increase production output, decision-makers realized the company would need to upgrade to a more responsive and flexible manufacturing setup supported by agile business applications. They looked for a solution with the ability to build individual, custom-configured vehicles in sequence while simultaneously maintaining high operating line efficiencies and full sequencing with the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recognizing the critical role of supply chain and manufacturing operations in the day-to-day and strategic focus of the organization, Ferrari introduced new supply-chain processes with a target of &amp;quot;zero shortages&amp;quot; in the production line. This meant that no parts shortages would occur at any point of the production chain, thereby eliminating the unacceptable delay such a shortage would cause. This strategy required the creation of a production grid, which accounts for all of the possible combinations of customizable elements. The grid enabled Ferrari to have all the right components ready and in the right place at the right time. Cars could then be produced quickly and with greater precision, to the exact requirements of customers, while still capitalizing on the time and efficiency savings of automated processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Driven by the projected increase in production numbers, this new strategy required a very tight connection between the supply chain and manufacturing operations technology. This communication was enabled by the implementation of a solution that provides connectivity between Ferrari&amp;#39;s many disparate applications, facilitating tightly integrated business processes such as order configuration, advanced planning and scheduling, assembly line scheduling and sequencing, and supplier management. Integration gave the company increased control over its supply chain and asset maintenance and management. As an example of this control, Ferrari is able to freeze engineering changes at the sub-line level, while still making changes to the overall bill of materials. As a result, Ferrari was able to increase production by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The capabilities found in the next-generation material handling and manufacturing control systems like the one implemented by Ferrari illustrate the potential benefits to automotive manufacturers of all types. Manufacturers should consider this path, which is relatively easy because of the technology&amp;#39;s ability to integrate with existing legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/3g4V8gStcdM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Achieving a Lean Transformation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/4/0b233c0a-d6d2-4f43-b931-9e975107876d_orion5.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A company that is moving from an old way of doing things to applying lean principles is said to be going through a lean transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lean transformation is more than just eliminating waste. It involves changing a culture. It requires changing your thinking. It means changing your relationships with your customers and suppliers. A lean transformation is a complete transformation of your business, and it is going to be difficult to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the book &lt;em&gt;Becoming Lean: Inside Stories of U.S. Manufacturers&lt;/em&gt;, Jeffrey K. Liker writes this about a lean transformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When it works, it is a frighteningly powerful competitive advantage, but to accomplish it and keep it going is very difficult.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the forward to the same book, James Womack writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Why is lean thinking and lean manufacturing so challenging to implement? It is not &amp;mdash; as many early commentators believed &amp;mdash; a set of isolated techniques, but a complete business system, a way of designing, selling and manufacturing complex products that requires the cooperation of thousands of people and hundreds of independent organizations. A successful &amp;#39;lean leap&amp;#39; (lean transformation) requires &amp;#39;change agent&amp;#39; leadership, a sensei (teacher) to demonstrate the techniques, a long-term commitment to the workforce to inspire their best efforts, proactive development of the supply base, aggressive management of distribution and sales system to smooth demand, and a score-keeping system (accounting methods plus individual compensation) that motivates managers to do the right thing every time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lean transformation is really about people, and people changing how they do their jobs. The way to get started is to start small, let employees become comfortable with and confident in the changes a lean transformation brings, and build support for future changes. This usually means starting with the low hanging fruit, the easiest things to do that also bring the largest benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Lean Transformation Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;#39;s say you own a company that makes widgets. These widgets are usually black and come with two buttons. Lately, customers have been ordering widgets in other colors such as red and blue. So once a month, your company does a special production run to produce the red and blue widgets. Of course, you charge more for these special orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One day the sales manager comes into your office. One of your largest customers has just switched to buying widgets from your competitor, ABC Widgets. The competitor can supply any color widget, put the customer&amp;#39;s logo on it and deliver them in two days. Their price is also 10 percent less than your price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s impossible!&amp;quot; you say. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ll soon go out of business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But over the next few months, more and more of your customers switch to buying from your competitor. Not only is ABC Widgets delivering custom widgets at a lower cost, they are guaranteeing better than a 99-percent on-time delivery, have higher quality and have just come out with a new lightweight three-button widget. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABC Widgets has undergone a lean transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Elements of a Lean Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What changed? How is ABC Widgets able to produce high-quality custom widgets, sell them at a lower price, deliver them quickly and still be able to innovate and develop new widget designs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a variety of lean principles that combine to produce a lean transformation. They have names such as kanban, kaizen, 5S and total productive maintenance. However, a lean transformation does not start by picking a lean principle and implementing it. It starts with your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Does the Customer Value?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first question to ask is, &amp;quot;What is the customer willing to pay for?&amp;quot; If there is a step in your manufacturing process that is not adding value for the customer, that step should be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, widgets have always been produced with rounded corners. Everyone has forgotten why, but that&amp;#39;s the way they&amp;#39;ve always been made. But ABC Widgets learned that customers don&amp;#39;t need widgets with rounded corners. So their widgets have square corners, which eliminated three steps in the production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, growing numbers of customers wanted widgets of various colors. Custom colors added value to widgets that customers were willing to pay for. As a result, ABC Widgets designed an automated painting machine that had multiple paint nozzles instead of one. The new machine could paint individual widgets in any color with no change-over time required and at no more cost than painting them all black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Introducing Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As ABC Widgets improved its understanding of its customer&amp;#39;s needs, the company implemented a &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; type of manufacturing system. This lean principle uses customer demand to &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; products through the manufacturing process. For ABC Widgets, this meant that widgets were not manufactured until they had been ordered. With waste in the production process eliminated, the entire process tightened up to include just those things that added value to the customer. Custom widgets could be produced in less time and with higher quality. Instead of waiting up to a month to get widgets in the colors they wanted, ABC Widget customers could get their custom-colored widgets in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; approach to manufacturing is a lean technique called kanban. A kanban is a signal that a customer order has been received and a product needs to be produced. With Kanban, inventories are reduced (freeing additional space), and products are produced based on customer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Not a Smooth Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Things did not go smoothly as ABC Widgets moved ahead with its lean transformation. There was confusion, and people tended to go back to their old way of doing things. Problems such as machine breakdowns, long change-over times to reconfigure machines to make different styles of widgets and not having the right tooling available when it was needed were all serious stumbling blocks that looked like they would derail the lean transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Introducing 5S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 5S lean technique involves getting cleaned up and organized. With 5S, unused tools, equipment and supplies are eliminated or stored in a remote location. Regularly used tools and supplies are stored close to where they are needed in a way that makes it easy to quickly and correctly return them to their proper storage location when they are not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once ABC Widgets had implemented 5S, some of the problems were cleared up. Clean work areas and machines made it easy to spot oil and fluid leaks. The sources of the leaks could then be fixed long before they became major maintenance problems. Tools and dies could be easily found when they were needed. Employees took more pride in their work and became more supportive of the lean transformation, including contributing their ideas for further improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Kaizen Continues the Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is an on-going process of continual improvement. It is based on suggestions from those closest to production, the employees who make the products. However, at times suggestions come from other employees or even from customers. The objective is to continually make small improvements, and it does not matter where the ideas for improvement come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even when everything was going well, ABC Widgets continued to encourage employees to make suggestions, and they acted quickly on those suggestions. Employees could quickly see the positive impact of their suggestions, and when managers thought a suggestion would not work, they quickly followed up with the employee. By talking with those making the suggestions, the ABC Widgets managers learned about the problems and issues that were causing waste or quality problems, and in some cases solutions not envisioned in the original suggestion were developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Lean Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As ABC Widgets continued its lean transformation, other lean principles were applied. Total productive maintenance was used to put preventative maintenance into the hands of the machine operators. Value stream mapping helped identify activities that added value customers wanted and eliminated waste. Poka-yoke was used to reduce the possibility of errors and improve quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Visual Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many lean techniques and principles rely on visual communication to keep employees informed about production status and customer needs. ABC Widgets used DuraLabel printers to make custom labels and signs that supported the changes being made. Reminders about the changes were posted where they were most needed. Employees were able to make and sustain the needed changes with minimum disruptions to the on-going production. The signs and labels also provided warnings about new hazards, changes in production configuration and modifications to the facility. With the ability to make custom signs that specifically addressed each situation, ABC Widgets kept its employees informed and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Lean Transformation Continues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It took ABC Widgets nearly two years to reach the point where it began to take away significant numbers of customers from its competitors. But that was not the end of its lean transformation. As the former industry leader tried to begin its own lean transformation, ABC Widgets continued to apply lean principles and improve further. New widget designs continued to expand the market, and powered by its ever-improving efficiency, quality and innovation, ABC Widgets moved into making related products and serving new markets. It was not easy. The lean transformation never eliminated the need for hard work, but it multiplied those efforts so that the results were much greater than had ever been experienced in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/kW0yBXF18Xo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>6 Ways to Get Lean in 2016</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/28/cea4b037-7de6-4a5c-b16d-28caf762baba_lean.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 215px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ve loosened the belt a notch or two over the years. Inch by inch the borders around the waist have gotten a little wider. Bad habits have formed. An unhealthy diet creating large amounts of waste is clogging the main arteries. Things are noticeably slower. Let&amp;#39;s admit it. You know you could do better. It&amp;#39;s time your workplace went on a lean diet and turned it into a work style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Look around your workplace for the following to identify what areas need some TLC. It&amp;#39;s a new year, a fresh slate, and it&amp;#39;s time to lean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Follow the Motion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Are workers having to walk around to look for tools, parts or people? If there is a system in place, does it work and is everyone adhering to it?&amp;nbsp;The 5-S program, born out of 1940s Japanese manufacturing lines, is a brilliantly simple system that will improve productivity in your workplace. Through organization, identification, maintenance and sustainability, the system is not just a process but a cultural way of thinking focused on efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr.&amp;nbsp;Gwendolyn Galsworth, a leading expert in visual workplace training, said one of the leading indicators for whether an environment is efficient is motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I look for motion when I go into a plant,&amp;quot; she added. &amp;quot;Motion leads you to answers &amp;hellip; I look at changeovers (and) lead time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When inefficient motion happens, it reveals a lot about the health of an environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Prevent the Waiting Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The opposite of motion is people, orders or things in general sitting idle. Clock watchers or complaints about not having enough work to keep busy while waiting for other departments to fulfill their tasks are prime identifiers of wasted time and energy. When management and executives take regularly scheduled&amp;nbsp;gemba walks&amp;nbsp;to see firsthand what is happening in the plant or the warehouse, they can physically observe how time is spent. Are people waiting for approvals, materials, information or repairs? Lean practices encourage managers to go on a gemba walk at least once a week to see what is going on in various departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Find Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Design errors, material flaws or inspection errors can be greatly reduced when implementing Kanban, which is another Japanese-influenced pull system that maximizes efficiency in getting products to and from the assembly line. Look for ways to standardize tasks. There is usually a best way to perform a task most efficiently that minimizes defects, wasted materials and motion. This standardized task should be recorded and used in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once standard tasks have been developed, the amount of time and materials required is established. Lead times become the yardstick for measuring efficiency at this point. Staffing and material flows should be balanced so workers have to do minimal walking, waiting or material handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Refine Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that lead times have become a measuring tool, how else can this become more precise? How do orders come in and go out? How long do orders sit in their holding area? A wire molding company in Connecticut transformed its holding time for orders from one day to just three hours through the implementation of lean techniques. The financial impact this can have on a company may be incredible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assess Layout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the first things to look for in a plant are the lines on the floor access. Are there smart borders? Is the width of the floor marking&amp;nbsp;for forklift and storage being maximized? Departments, work areas and storage areas should be designed for quick and easy access for workers. Streamlining material and inventory flow will minimize walking, transportation costs and holding times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Apply the Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you begin to apply lean tools? If you haven&amp;#39;t played soccer, do you purchase a ball, all the gear, read the rules and then expect to play like Diego Maradona or Lionel Messi? You need to have realistic expectations. A total team commitment is required for a lean transformation, which will lead to a cultural change in your workplace. Is your workplace mature enough to begin this change? Are they receptive to it? Once you commit to your lean journey, you&amp;#39;ll see measurable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Always look for ways to improve and resources to help you in this transformation. You&amp;#39;ve taken the first step in the lean direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/mHB7Lr5tlkQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Lean Manufacturing is Influencing Other Industries</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/14/c9692e74-1255-4802-a553-1e036cdc5e47_lean.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Around the world, the aim is the same &amp;mdash; to produce a product as cost effectively as possible, to deliver it to the customer as quickly as possible and to do it with as few impediments as possible. Often, the weak link in the chain is the same as the strength: people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to increase the productivity of the people involved and to minimize risk, business has turned to process. One such process, lean manufacturing, is a methodology originally developed by Toyota to increase efficiency within its plants. Since then, lean production philosophies have worked their way into many facets of management through lean thinking principles. Lean thinking can now be found in fields as diverse as software houses and the building industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Branching Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the same time frame that Toyota was developing lean, Motorola was creating a methodology that became known as Six Sigma. It found wider acclaim in the 1990s when Jack Welsh&amp;#39;s guardianship of General Electric saw it become a cornerstone of the business. Like Toyota, General Electric needed to combine the efficiency of its people with a requirement to cut waste. The two are now indelibly linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whereas Six Sigma looks to improve process by means of statistical analysis of production metrics, lean seeks to improve the flow, eliminating unevenness. Like many of the terms used in business, flow crosses many boundaries. Sportsmen, artists and programmers all seek the Zen-like state of being &amp;quot;in the zone.&amp;quot; With the workforce in aggregation working in a state of flow, the process will almost look after itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just in time (JIT) is another manufacturing approach that emanated from Japan and caught the world&amp;#39;s interest. Lean, Six Sigma and JIT are companionable bedfellows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Where Manufacturing Leads, Others Follow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If something is good in one industry, it will be adapted by another. Hence, both lean and JIT make use of Kanban, another innovation from the east that has inculcated its presence the world over. Kanban, again with its nascence in Toyota, is best translated as a signboard or billboard. In software, Kanban is the latest iteration of thinking in the agile methodology process suite. Dig a little deeper though and agile (lightweight, flexible and responsive) development of usable software in as short a time as possible is not so far removed from lean practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although Six Sigma is ostensibly about statistics, lean about flow, and JIT about the elimination of waste, they all have one thing in common. From Abraham Maslow&amp;#39;s study of the hierarchy of needs to Frederick Herzberg&amp;#39;s motivation and hygiene factors, all of these theories and practices become the bedrock of management teaching practices because they all have one common factor: people. Get the people part of your process right and the rest will follow. People the world over respond to the same principles, whatever the language and wherever the birthplace of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Limiting the Dangers and Recovering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is one significant difference between manufacturing and the more office-bound industries like software houses. If things go wrong during the operation of large pieces of manufacturing machinery, people can get hurt. It is no surprise then that the practice of health and safety is paramount within heavy manufacturing. However, if things do go wrong, all is not lost. Every process builds in space for feedback, for the ability to extract the lessons learned from every iteration of the process that went before. If lessons are not learned, information is wasted just as much as the physical assets. Keeping all production within the standard normal beloved by Six Sigma should be every process&amp;#39;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/_t9Gq5I7YSk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lean Manufacturing Shortcuts to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/12/17/05ba14e7-b4b9-47b4-a577-113b8c26c96f_manufacturing-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Lean manufacturing incorporates efficiency and simplicity to reduce waste from labor and materials losses while increasing profits. Lean production also requires quality production, or your business loses through product waste. While taking shortcuts may initially seem like a way to reduce costs, the savings are only temporary. In fact, the small amount of savings from poor practices can cost your company much more in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Materials Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obviously, using low-quality materials to reduce costs will often turn out badly. You can experiment with some changes, but what is produced must still meet your clients&amp;rsquo; quality requirements. Problems frequently occur when trying to reduce costs by ordering a minimum amount of raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For items with short lead times, you can keep your on-hand materials at a minimum. Inventory with longer leads must not be allowed to run low. Work with your suppliers to build a strong relationship. Suppliers should alert you if a particular material might suddenly be in low supply. You may even be able to work out bulk pricing with interval shipments. This keeps your on-hand materials at the correct level and helps your suppliers know how much inventory they must have available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Production Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean operation involves a balancing act of having the required number of products available for on-time delivery. Excess production costs your company money in cash flow and storage. Not having enough inventory is just as bad. Trying to run production as short as possible will backfire when quality issues or other losses develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The kanban approach is often recommended for managing on-hand product. To use this method successfully, you need to have accurate figures on how much product is required for a 30-, 60- or 90-day period. Options include working with your customers to establish a predictable demand rate. You can also reduce the setup time for production changeovers using Single-Minute Exchange of Die&amp;nbsp;(SMED)&amp;nbsp;wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Safety Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety is one area where shortcuts should never be taken. It is also extremely common for employees to skip steps to increase production or to get work done quicker. It may be faster to work with a safety guard out of the way, but the guard is there for a reason. Likewise, it may be faster to make repairs without shutting off the power, but the risk of electrocution or entrapment is too large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even trying to speed up conveyors or other assembly-line systems can lead to safety issues. Supervisors must be vigilant in looking at how employees are working to make sure that safety shortcuts are never taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Repair and Maintenance Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment failures create downtime. Maintenance schedules cannot be ignored in an effort to save time or labor. You may need to schedule an extra individual to work abnormal production hours, but the maintenance must be performed. Ignoring a worn-out belt or a small oil leak now can result in a major breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are ways to keep your equipment operational and maintain your lean production goals. Use quality equipment and replacement parts the first time. For example, wires and cables running to your equipment should be rated at more than just the minimum specifications. High-quality wires and cables reduce downtime and increase production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If cables require high flexibility or insulation to resist chemicals, purchase cables that include these features. Use longer-life oils and oil filters, even if you normally follow a perfect maintenance schedule. You must consider the costs of constantly replacing lower quality parts, the labor involved in replacement and the loss of the equipment during repair to realize how much this type of shortcut truly costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If your company can afford to have spare equipment, you can rotate use through repair cycles. For instance, if you have four drill press operators and five drill presses, one machine can always be on standby. Keep at least one set of standard replacement or repair part sets available for each type of equipment you are running. Losing a piece of equipment for several days due to a broken belt or cable will not help you meet your lean production goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/M6-s1tguFAE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How 3-D Printing is Revolutionizing Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/11/12/3b77db6f-d733-4948-9d11-47c5ddf2d6cc_3d-printer.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;It&amp;#39;s no coincidence that 3-D printing is making a splash just as the conversation is turning toward lean. Lean manufacturing and 3-D printing go together naturally. While 3-D printing isn&amp;#39;t a new technology, it is getting more attention lately because of the potential cost implications for everyone involved. The leaner you are, the more you save and the more you create. The catalyst is 3-D printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are a few reasons why 3-D printing and lean manufacturing go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Easier Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prototypes are expensive. Traditionally, prototypes are made with drilling, cutting and removing materials. It&amp;#39;s a potentially wasteful process that is prone to errors. Additionally, prototyping is often a process that is outsourced to a third party, which results in marked up prices and delays. You can use 3-D printing to get around all of that. As the technology is becoming less expensive, a business can create a prototype at a relatively low cost, do it all in-house and ultimately reduce wasted products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Easily Customize Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;#39;s customers are pickier. The days of one-size-fits-all bulk are largely behind us, and that has complicated manufacturing. Because 3-D printing does not require the same molding and cutting as traditional manufacturing, each product can vary as needed. The ability to customize allows you to diversify and keep customers happy while running a leaner operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Creativity and Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The prospect of leaner manufacturing is emboldening manufacturers to take more risks, as the stakes are much lower. What 3-D printing gives manufacturers is the creative freedom to design while still in the concept stage, before a prototype even enters the equation. As a result, they are wasting less time with trial and error, which is traditionally associated with prototyping. They also reduce the amount of materials that fall by the wayside, and they make much more efficient use of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A crucial advantage of 3-D printing is consistency. Once properly programmed, a 3-D printer will create exactly what you want, every single time. It not only keeps customers pleased, but it helps you run a lean shop. You aren&amp;#39;t wasting materials on production runs that go awry, and you are no longer wasting valuable time on inconsistent products. For that reason alone, 3-D printing is revolutionizing the idea of lean manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Shorter Lead Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Exorbitant lead times are anything but lean. Wasted time is never good for lean operations, and putting an unfeasible rush on a production run will almost always result in wasteful mistakes. Because 3-D printing is consistent, you know what to expect and can set more reasonable lead times. It&amp;#39;s good for business and good for lean manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Local Manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned above, customers like the ability to have customized products, and they like knowing that it won&amp;#39;t take forever to get them. Local 3-D printing gives customers the close oversight they prefer and increases their ability to customize and tweak a product. The more they can be a part of the process, the more likely a manufacturer is to get it right. That means less wasted product and more happy customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lower Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s about keeping customers happy, and nothing makes them smile more than lower prices. With 3-D printing, it is possible to reduce the number of steps required to see a product through from concept to production as well as the amount of material that gets scrapped during production. Those savings of both time and material mean that customers will ultimately pay less and will return for new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	New Consumer Demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s all a cycle. Customers and businesses are becoming aware of the efficiencies being made possible with 3-D printing. They are excited by the idea of customized products and the potential cost savings. With that excitement comes innovation, and with innovation comes new ways to be lean in manufacturing. One way to jumpstart lean manufacturing is with 3-D printing. It also will likely lead to new, leaner processes.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Contrasting Lean with Maintenance Best Practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations view improving their maintenance and reliability best practices as being distinct and separate from implementing lean initiatives. However, in reality a number of the processes involved in maintenance best practices incorporate the same principles as lean. This 3-minute video details the seven wastes in lean and how maintenance best practices can help you integrate lean concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Basics of Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a term used to describe a process of analysis and creative problem-solving. It shifts an organization&amp;#39;s focus to creating value for the consumer by shortening production cycles, eliminating waste and emphasizing efficiency. This 8-minute, 18-second video explains how lean principles and practices can revolutionize the way an organization operates. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Techniques to Improve Manufacturing Productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/13/7f51520c-7226-42ce-9aa3-3a8ec3ded698_GP_Shadow-Board_Web2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;From two-slice toasters to Boeing jets, tools and dies are omnipresent staples of manufacturing. And where there are tools and dies, there are idle employees and lost production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three decades ago, Dr. Shigeo Shingo largely solved this problem with the introduction of single-minute exchange of dies (SMED), a lean manufacturing technique that was designed to reduce the amount of time tooling and die changes require. Single minute means a time period less than 10 minutes &amp;ndash; a single digit time. Dr. Shingo&amp;#39;s innovations continue to influence the automotive and other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;SMED is about an attitude of continuous improvement and never becoming complacent with the status quo,&amp;quot; said Bob McClintic, aka Dr. Die Cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tools, dies and molds are fundamental to manufacturing. Tools are used to cut and form metal and other materials. Dies are metal forms used to shape metal in stamping and forging operations. Molds, which are also of metal, are used to shape plastics, ceramics and composite materials. Both low-pressure casting and high-pressure die casting use steel molds called &amp;quot;dies&amp;quot; to produce products from automotive transmission cases to aluminum wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In manufacturing, tooling and die changes take a considerable amount of time. While tooling or die changes are being made, production lines are shut down. This lost time and associated costs must be covered. In addition, the downtime for changing tooling or dies impacts other production decisions. The more time it takes, the longer the production cycle. Operations personnel increase lot sizes and run longer in order to reduce the impact of setup costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are advantages to having the tool or die out of the machine that may not be apparent at first glance. Molding, stamping, tooling and cutting are processes that all produce soils that can affect the performance of the process to make quality parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Mike Bangasser of Best Technology Inc., the best time to clean the die or mold is as it comes out of the machine &amp;ndash; not when it&amp;#39;s time to try and re-install it in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Cutting fluids, slag and other particulates will accumulate on the surface of a mold or die during normal usage,&amp;quot; Bangasser said. &amp;quot;Especially in precision applications, it&amp;#39;s critical to clean the working surfaces to ensure correct tolerances are maintained. Letting soiled tooling sit on the shelf is like letting your dinner dishes, pots and pans sit on the counter overnight before trying to wash them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tool and die companies, which are typically small businesses staffed by skilled craft workers, make it possible for their customers to manufacture innovative products, from auto parts to household appliances to fighter planes. High-volume tool and die shops have incorporated &amp;quot;quick change&amp;quot; fixtures to reduce setup time and increase accuracy between machining processes. However, when tool and die changes take too long, complications arise including higher manufacturing costs, lower quality levels, excessive test runs and pulling people off task to find tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By contrast, employees at Honda&amp;#39;s plant in Anna, Ohio, are superstars when it comes to die changes, completing changes on 3,500-ton die-casting machines in 15 to 20 minutes. Others may take up to four hours to perform similar operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	SMED Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With SMED, increased production is achieved without purchasing new equipment or hiring additional employees.&amp;nbsp;In addition, because SMED reduces the number of items that must be produced in a production run, the production line becomes available to produce other products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because SMED reduces changeover time, it becomes economically possible to have smaller production runs.&amp;nbsp;This provides a number of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;
		Less capital is tied up in inventory and less warehouse space is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;
		Less work in progress, reducing costs further.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;
		The ability to quickly respond to market changes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;
		Improved quality and less waste. Defects can be identified and the problem corrected without large quantities of defective product being carried in inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;
		Product innovations, which provide a competitive advantage, can be brought to the market sooner because inventories of the older product are smaller and will be sold off quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using SMED to reduce changeover times provides a number of benefits that go right to the bottom line, including improved productivity and greater equipment utilization, but don&amp;#39;t expect instant results. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These kinds of transformations take planning,&amp;quot; said Steve Udvardy, director of research, education and technology for the North American Die Casting Association. &amp;quot;Management is often so busy putting out fires with concerns about detracting from what we&amp;#39;re doing today to think about how these kinds of shifts will make things better in the long run. Upper management has to set the tone, take the time and discipline to help foster a culture of change and understand that there will be hurdles to overcome.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Not Just Tools and Dies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being in tune with SMED is like being the producer of a Broadway show. As everyone knows, the show must go on &amp;ndash; even if you have to rehearse a few times with all the necessary players and tools in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The No. 1 way that SMED changes human behavior is making one more conscious of waste,&amp;quot; said Udvardy. &amp;quot;If you can reduce eight turns of a wrench to one-quarter turn of a wrench to tighten a clamp, then that&amp;#39;s progress.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	SMED Tools and Visual Communications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clear communication is vital throughout this process. Checklists should be provided to ensure everything is ready before the shutdown begins. Procedures should be readily available. Safety warnings and information must be prominent, including labeling tooling as &amp;quot;ready to set&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not ready, work order incomplete.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utilize your smartphone&amp;#39;s video camera to record details of all team and changeover activities. Capture activities from both the operator and helper sides of the machine. Record elapsed time. Install a sign that reads, &amp;quot;Cameras are recording work for learning purposes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Use stop watches to record incremental changeover activities with timelines. This information can be helpful to measure time data in the changeover process with people, machines and equipment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Create and post charts and graphs for recording data. Correlate activities on the Y axis and incremental time/elapsed time on the X axis. Capture data from team members and record and share with your teams. Break activities into specific actions/activities such as &amp;quot;move die to machine, align die with keyways, clamp die, connect hydraulics and/or electrical switches.&amp;quot; This will allow you to identify areas where more practice is needed or simpler methods can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like all changes, achieving proficiency in SMED is not an overnight exercise. Instead, expect a few bumps in the road. Training, review and reassurance will be necessary. Help your team by communicating key SMED messages with signs and labels that can be easily updated and relocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/cEqQ6ajhJmk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Jabil Wins Lean Best Practice Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Jabil Shanghai was recently named the winner of the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE) Lean Best Practice Award in recognition of its efforts to drive innovation and Lean Six Sigma capabilities in optimizing manufacturing processes at its facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The award was presented to two of the Jabil Shanghai team members, Jack Chen and XuYu Feng, at an awards ceremony in Montreal, Canada. The Jabil team beat out finalist projects from IBM, American Fidelity and Tata Group. Judged by IIE members and lean experts from various industries, the team was ranked based on their innovation, clarity, tools used, results and the project&amp;#39;s sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The IIE 2014 Best Practice Award is truly a credit to the Shanghai team,&amp;quot; said Walter Garvin, vice president of global Lean Six Sigma. &amp;quot;The team exemplifies how lean can impact our customers and our employees to create new opportunities and a better society. We are very grateful for this award and all the hard work and dedication that it represents all across Jabil.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IIE competition was established four years ago to recognize the innovative and effective implementation of lean principles and practices that deliver exemplary performance improvements. Past winners include IBM, Xerox, the University of Texas&amp;#39; M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and MAS Linea Aqua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I was extremely impressed by the Jabil team presentation in the IIE 2014 Lean Best Practice Award competition,&amp;quot; said Dave Harry, IIE lean division board of directors and president and CEO of Process Whisperer. &amp;quot;Jack Chen and XuYu Feng gave a clear and compelling story of Jabil&amp;#39;s remarkable and effective lean transformation in the Shanghai plant. It was evident there was strong Jabil commitment at the top, great teamwork and an excellent use of a range of lean tools and concepts throughout their innovative presentation. I have judged many world-class team excellence presentations, and this ranks among the best.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jabil&amp;#39;s lean program was officially launched four years ago and now spans the company&amp;#39;s 90 plants in 33 countries, with more than 71,000 improvement projects in 2013 alone. The company has been able to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce variations, defects, costs and non-value added activities, enhancing process value stream flow and delivering customer products in the most effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Benefits of Lean Six Sigma</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/16/43fcb402-dafb-44f4-8942-31d6d3a02595_sixsigmaplant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In a competitive, global marketplace, customers are more attuned to quality craftsmanship than ever before. They are also more likely to value corporate stewardship, especially as it relates to sustainability. In a March 2012 Nielsen survey, two thirds of customers responded that they would prefer to buy products and services from companies that contribute to the good of society, with environmental stewardship highest on the list. Nearly half of the respondents said they would pay more for such products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial facilities can achieve dramatic improvements in both quality and sustainability by adopting a single process methodology: Lean Six Sigma. However, personnel in many enterprises &amp;mdash; from executive decision-makers to plant employees â often misunderstand both the concepts of Lean Six Sigma and the realities of its implementation. In this article, we will look at these issues and make recommendations for how plants can reap substantial rewards from a Lean Six Sigma program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Lean Six Sigma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma is a conceptual framework that, when properly implemented, extends far beyond the plant floor and into every aspect of a company&amp;#39;s business. It combines two of today&amp;#39;s most influential trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving quality, as measured by eliminating defects and process variation, increasing predictability and consistency, and focusing on those products/processes/services that the customer values most (Six Sigma).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reducing waste, as measured by eliminating or drastically reducing unnecessary motion, transportation, inventory, processing, production and defects (Lean).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma represents a perfect union of two beneficial practices. Although the concept of Lean encourages a sustainable, cost-effective outcome, it does not by itself provide the necessary process-improvement strategies to achieve these goals. Six Sigma is all about process improvement, with benchmarking (measuring to establish performance-improvement targets) and prioritizing (determining which process improvements will yield the greatest results) adding value to the effort. In other words, with Six Sigma, a company can determine exactly how many problems, defects, flaws, inaccuracies, etc., are occurring and then provide a systematic methodology to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMAIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma involves five distinct steps: define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC). Although many facilities pay lip service to these steps, the ones for whom Lean Six Sigma provides the most improvement truly embrace them throughout all levels of operation. DMAIC isn&amp;#39;t a magic recipe for achieving the benefits of Lean Six Sigma as a whole. Rather, it is a formula for achieving the incremental benefits that eventually lead to quality and waste reduction, using a continual feedback loop to refine processes in pursuit of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Lean and DMAIC may drive improvements on the plant floor, the principles are applicable in every corner of the organization. The excellence that Lean Six Sigma fosters permeates the entire operation, and both customers and employees are happier as a result. This fact is evidenced by the many companies â from accounting firms to human resources agenciesâwho are achieving dramatic results with Lean Six Sigma. These are 100-percent service firms without a single product to design, engineer, build, finish or repair, and yet Lean Six Sigma is meaningful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Keys to Achievement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many companies and facilities, the breakdown of Lean Six Sigma occurs when management or personnel misunderstands its intrinsic nature. Lean Six Sigma isn&amp;#39;t an approach that an organization adopts purely to save money. It also isn&amp;#39;t a sprint or a cookie-cutter solution that works the same way for everyone. Lean Six Sigma requires substantial discipline and governance. In order to prove its effectiveness, it must produce results that can be validated, whether that validation comes from the finance department documenting monetary savings or the service department being flooded with positive customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of dedicated effort and patience in a successful implementation cannot be overstated. A few of the core requirements that are necessary for companies or facilities to succeed with Lean Six Sigma include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations must have a compelling reason for implementing Lean Six Sigma.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Senior management must be 100-percent invested in and committed to achieving Lean Six Sigma. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Companies must be willing to invest in appropriate, qualified resources for the initiative, whether those resources are employees, materials, technologies or a combination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stakeholders and participants must work together as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Team members must be empowered to carry out initiatives without the need for constant evaluation and approval.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations must commit sufficient time and resources to training, which is crucial to achieving a positive outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When companies work on their priorities, they should focus not on improvements that create change quickly but rather on those that have the most impact on quality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The feedback loop is pivotal to incremental and long-lasting improvement and cannot be bypassed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Why Lean Six Sigma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If Lean Six Sigma requires so much dedication and effort, why go through it at all? The answer is that the rewards can be truly amazing. Some of the positive improvements that facilities see when adopting this approach include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Value for the Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma leads to improved service, delivery and quality, all of which creates value for customers and drives business to the company&amp;#39;s door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Increased Workforce Productivity and Morale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not only does the process improvement from Lean Six Sigma increase productivity, but surveys show that it also boosts employee attitudes and satisfaction within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Fluid Strategic Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma operations are more nimble and flexible regarding changing conditions, enabling them to adapt more readily to unanticipated changes in the business or economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Stronger Competitive Stance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customers, vendors and partners are drawn to the type of excellence and success that Lean Six Sigma operations exhibit, making these firms more competitive in all aspects of business operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Standards-Driven Achievement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When processes are standardized, personnel training, project management and monitoring, problem-solving and other aspects of corporate operations are simplified and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Better Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When personnel and management aren&amp;#39;t constantly solving problems and/or surmounting challenges, it opens the way for more innovative and imaginative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Healthier Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not only do lean operations save money in terms of reduced waste of all types, but greater customer satisfaction and fewer returns result in higher profitability. Numerous companies have documented annual savings from Lean Six Sigma initiatives that range from $2,000 to $250,000 (and higher) per improvement, and those figures don&amp;#39;t include the added value of increased sales, enhanced reputation and expanded customer goodwill. The U.S. Army reports that its Lean Six Sigma initiatives have resulted in savings approaching $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/phLOIZddvPE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Choose Continuous Improvement over Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Some organizations misuse lean manufacturing to overwork their people and reduce the overall headcount. Let me assure you, I am not arguing to counter the fact that reducing the headcount will save money. In the short term, it most certainly will save money. However, this savings in headcount does come at a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some managers seek headcount reduction because they associate fewer operators with increased profits. Elimination of headcount for this reason yields poor results culturally. Soon after launching a campaign such as this, operators will start noticing the intent. This will lead to a refusal to cooperate with any effort to reduce headcount and eliminate waste. The operators will begin to adamantly resist changes because they are fearful of losing their job or possibly contributing to a co-worker&amp;rsquo;s job loss. This causes stress, conflict, finger-pointing and eventually failure. It also is a surefire way to pit management against the shop floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This lack of understanding has left a bad taste in the mouths of many shop-floor employees. Likewise, it has also contributed to the conquered attitude of many managers because they have attempted this idea of &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; before and have seen it fail more than once. Understandably, this is frustrating for an organization&amp;rsquo;s leadership as well as other employees. It leads me to the opinion that the word &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; might need to be eliminated from our vocabulary for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think when leaders focus strictly on lean, they inevitably pay more attention to the dollar numbers. While the dollar numbers are important, there are other elements within an organization that far outweigh the bottom dollar. These elements create awe-inspiring flexibility and opportunity for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is my opinion that running a lean organization is actually a by-product of continuous improvement philosophies, specifically the eighth waste (the underutilization of people). When you focus your sights on lean and lean alone, you miss the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is the most important element to true organizational maturity. Continuous improvement philosophy zeroes in on culture and stimulates its development. It focuses on the people and the success of the organizational team. Its aim is to involve and engage everyone, to educate and stimulate the minds of the people. It requires everyone&amp;rsquo;s engagement, commitment and trust. It is culture-driven and will help the company grow. Everyone should be trained on its ideals and philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a continuous improvement organization to truly thrive, leadership must dedicate at least 85 percent of its efforts to the development of employees through training, influence and on-the-job training. Once the majority of the organization understands the philosophy, then and only then is it time to move to the next step. Otherwise, resistance will remain at the doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The remaining 15 percent can then be dedicated to implementing the actual tools and engaging employees. The employees who own the process need to make the change and improve the organization&amp;rsquo;s current state (with assistance from a trained continuous improvement team). Not only does this encourage them, but it also increases the chance that the change will be sustained and standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizational leaders must be careful not to put the cart before the horse. You cannot simply read or benchmark other companies and expect that you can photocopy that into your organization. You have to remember a picture is a snapshot in time. It does not tell you what happened before the picture was taken. Therefore, you cannot expect significant, highly profitable changes too fast. You cannot have the baby without going through the labor, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s get &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; out of our heads and start communicating continuous improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s broader, includes everyone (especially the operators) and will provide long-term gains. Let&amp;rsquo;s train, empower and engage rather than cut time, rebalance and lay off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/SNoV6ajTth8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Notable Solutions Earns 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Notable Solutions Inc. (NSi) recently received a 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award in the data capture category for its work with Toyota Industries North America (TINA). The 17&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;annual awards program recognizes excellence and innovation in the application of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;NSi has helped Toyota Industries of North America to automate many of their manual processes, thereby eliminating many paper-based systems, streamlining operations and enabling various departments within their organization to more effectively participate in their business processes,&amp;quot; said Mike Morper, vice president of marketing at Notable Solutions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We are extremely pleased to be recognized for the work that we have done to help Toyota securely automate many of their business processes and create a more collaborative environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota selected NSi to better manage thousands of paper and electronic documents for the groups involved in the manufacturing and sales of Toyota lift trucks.&amp;nbsp;The solution included a simpler and less-paper intensive way to track shipments, manage dealer and customer invoices and simplify the import/export process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota embraced NSi&amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the delivery of both electronic and paper documents into the same business process workflows, regardless of whether the document originated at a user&amp;rsquo;s workstation or was scanned on one of the company&amp;#39;s multi-function devices (MFDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toyota is committed to the kaizen principle of continuous improvement, and NSi has given us the ability to significantly improve our business processes and a platform to easily extend the solution to other areas in the organization,&amp;quot; said Dale Colliver, TINA&amp;#39;s information technology manager. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been able to save time and money, significantly improve productivity and install more efficient procedures that are helping people make quicker and better-informed business decisions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Standing Up for Lean Principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I recently came across a blog about an executive who switched from his traditional &amp;quot;sit-down desk&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;stand-up desk.&amp;quot; He remarked that he loved the new desk and would never switch back. This concept fascinated me, and I investigated it further. I read many articles, and as it turns out, Thomas Jefferson, Ernest Hemingway, Winston Churchill and many others worked on their feet up to 10 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was inspired by this dynamic concept. I thought if implemented creatively, it could benefit supervisors on the production floor. But I knew this was an unusual concept that wouldn&amp;#39;t be accepted right away. I had to try it for a period of time and demonstrate the possibilities. After all, if the stand-up desk is good enough for a man as intelligent as Thomas Jefferson, it&amp;#39;s worth a shot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I wanted to approach this experiment as I would if I was manipulating an assembly line or fabrication operation. So, before building the stand-up desk, I asked myself some very basic questions, many of which were based on 5-S concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I have at my sit-down desk that I can do without? (Seiri: Go through all materials and keep only essential items.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What can I do to ensure that everything has its place? (Seiton: There should be a place for everything, and everything should be in its place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I need to keep the desk area neat and orderly? (SeisÅ: Keep the workplace clean and neat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is my standard work? (Seiketsu: Work practices should be standardized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much space do I really need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do I need to maintain comfort while at the desk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I built this desk, I did many trials and errors before bringing it to the floor. It took about a month of contemplation and modification before it was ready. Once I had exactly what I felt could be trialed safely and comfortably, I made the leap and trashed my traditional desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this experiment, I&amp;#39;ll confess I was laughed at and labeled as &amp;quot;wacky&amp;quot; by some of my colleagues. That&amp;#39;s OK; a lot of new ideas receive ridicule before respect. I have now had my new desk for four months, and in my opinion, the stand-up desk has many positive benefits when looking at it from a lean perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/1/30/e3a382f4-b1f7-4344-9963-fdd4e042344f_standing desk.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 500px; height: 143px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is structured much like an assembly operation should be structured. I only have what I need when I need it. All of my materials (phone, keyboard, monitor, files, trash can, etc.) are within arm&amp;#39;s reach. I only have the amount of flat surface my standard work requires. On the occasion that I need more surface for writing or reading (periodical work), I have a flat surface that rolls out from under the desk and can be returned easily. As you can see from the picture, there was a lot of space saved as well &amp;mdash; 50 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everything on my desk has its place. Due to the fact that there is only enough space for what I need, it is very easy to keep neat and organized. I no longer have stacks of random papers, Post-its or folders. On the right side of my desk, I have a broom holder and a dustpan to sweep my area at the end of each day. This task is much easier with the new desk because the floor is visible and accessible on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As far as ergonomics, it is very comfortable. In my research, I found that when standing, it helps to elevate a foot to relieve strain from your back, so I added a bar across the bottom 6 inches from the floor. I also have a padded mat in front of the desk to reduce any fatigue. The monitor is at eye level, and the keyboard is at a height that would suit most individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have found that this desk has made me more active and I feel more energetic. Instead of &amp;quot;zoning out&amp;quot; in front of the computer (which occasionally happens to everyone), I do what I have to do and move on to more activity. This has led me to have faith that this would be a good cultural tool in the manufacturing community when linked with other lean measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have to assume that organizations (including mine) will not make this a standard, but if they do, great. If you decide to try it, remember that it is hard for the first week or so. Just maintain and focus. It gets better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I highly suggest that continuous improvement-driven individuals give this a try. I have read very little negative comments from the people who have tried it. I believe this can help standardize a supervisor&amp;#39;s work, promote dynamic 5-S practices and result in elevated activity on the manufacturing floor. It&amp;#39;s an idea that has been beneficial personally and has the potential to be beneficial to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/4stvMjRPm4Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Keep the Customer in Mind When Applying Lean Principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/1/23/868065fb-9049-4f9d-a687-845904151fa4_government red tape.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;I recently had cause to visit a state government office to conduct some business. Prior to my visit, I decided to do some legwork to see what I was in for and to ensure that I was prepared for the visit. The website was simple enough, and I had no problems discovering what I was looking for in preparation. So, I spent 15 to 20 minutes reviewing the website thinking (very incorrectly) that I might save myself some time if I prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day, I visited the office. I stood in line for almost 30 minutes to finally speak with a woman who proceeded to tell me the things that I had already read on the website while also asking a series of questions that the website had pointed out. She then gave me three pages of paperwork to fill out and directed me to wait &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot; until my name was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While waiting at the table (for one hour), I filled out the three pages of paperwork. The paperwork was very similar to what I had read online and to what the woman at the desk had asked me. I filled it out thinking about the gigantic tax bills I pay every year and simply shaking my head, but the fun would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, my name was called, and I went with a group of other folks into a room where a very polite gentleman proceeded to ask a series of questions. As you might have guessed, these were the same questions that I had read online, been asked by the woman at the desk and had filled out on the little questionnaire. He collected the paperwork and spent about 45 minutes covering things that mostly did not apply to me or my situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, I was almost three hours into this process and had accomplished absolutely nothing. I then was directed to a set of computers along with my &amp;quot;classmates&amp;quot; to fill out an online questionnaire. Care to venture a guess as to what was mostly on the questionnaire? Well, if you guessed that it was the same set of information that was on the website, told to the woman at the first desk, filled out on the paperwork, given to the man teaching the class and then covered by him once again, you would be absolutely correct. Give yourself a pat on the back and take a couple of aspirin. I would be willing to bet that someone else was also going to enter in the same information from my questionnaire that I had already filled out and was entering in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are like me, I hate seeing processes that simply don&amp;#39;t work. I like those processes even less when I am funding them involuntarily from my tax dollars. The people who I interacted with were courteous, friendly and genuinely interested in helping me, but much like what we see when we apply principles of lean, the people are not the problem. We have the people in a terrible process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many different ways could I have applied lean principles to this process to save me hours of time and save the government thousands (maybe millions) of dollars each year? I was the customer in the process, but nowhere along the process could I see that anyone had stopped and asked, &amp;quot;How are the customers going to feel about this process?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;#39;s review just a minute. What if I had gone online and completed the questionnaire at that point in time (the first time)? What would that have done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to drive (waste of transportation, gas and time).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to stand in line (waste of waiting).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to fill out the questionnaire again (waste of processing).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to listen to the little seminar (waste of a person).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to fill out the online questionnaire at the office (waste of processing, waste of a person).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of this is on top of the computers and equipment, buildings, overhead, and extra personnel standing around. Let&amp;#39;s not forget how I as the customer would have felt about the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you apply lean this year, start with your customer in mind and ask this simple question before proceeding: How does this process help my customer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/dZQ76EH6u-o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lean Implementation Solutions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After achieving success as part of a company&amp;#39;s lean transformation, it is not uncommon for a senior manager to decide to join another organization with the goal of making dramatic operational improvements through the deployment of lean principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical scenario, this manager jumps into the new role with much initial energy and optimism. However, in some cases, success often is not as forthcoming as initially expected. Operating results are not being realized, improvement ideas are not being sustained, and the workforce is slow to embrace a kaizen mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing that the root cause of the problem is deeper than employees simply not understanding lean jargon or a bunch of Americanized Japanese words, the manager typically seeks a course correction to get the lean program back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article explores three common scenarios that are often encountered during the first year of a lean deployment, along with advice for how each can be corrected or avoided altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Challenges with Employee Empowerment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key philosophy of lean manufacturing is to shift decision-making away from top management and closer to the customer. In practice, this means moving it down the organizational chart as close to the manufacturing process as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing this, a new senior manager may embrace the thinking only to discover that those to whom decisions are being delegated are simply not yet ready to make them. After all, it takes time for all levels of an organization to become comfortable making decisions that were previously the responsibility of their superiors. Individuals must learn to trust that decisions they make will not be second-guessed or reversed by someone higher up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given this situation, the new manager will have no choice but to take on the additional decision-making workload all while coaching his or her team how to become empowered. Both of these tasks will slow lean implementation progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To develop a more empowered workforce, it is important that the new manager repeatedly communicate the fact that delegating decisions down the organizational chart has become an expectation. It is not enough to mention this once or twice at a staff meeting or perhaps via email. Instead, like all change-management communication, the message must be repeated frequently and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, if someone makes a decision that in hindsight should have been made differently, it is critical to not reprimand the individual but use the event as a learning opportunity for all. After employees repeatedly hear about empowerment and see that their decisions will be honored by superiors, they will be much more eager to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Functional Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another difficulty that a new senior manager may not expect is the level of reliance on other functional groups. This is something that may have been taken for granted in the old job. Initially, lean improvements will take place on the shop floor with little change being asked of departments outside the plant management group. Over time, as kaizen ideas expand, their implementation will require cooperation from other functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, as part of a lean initiative, an automotive supplier decided to move away from an assembly-line-based system toward a cellular layout. In the old system, employees performed a single job at a single workstation. Even though products were built on an assembly line, which in theory would be a single-piece flow system, in practice inventory piled up between operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One reason for this unevenness in flow was due to the fact that the corporate culture accepted operator tardiness after breaks. While this waste of lost time was not noticeable in the old system, in the new cellular layout, production could not happen smoothly unless all employees were present. This situation inevitably caused complaints among some employees, who had grown to accept as a de-facto standard that a few minutes here or there did not matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human resources was consulted for guidance. During the discussion, it was discovered that although an attendance policy existed on paper, it had not been enforced for years. The challenge was reinstating the policy without demoralizing the workforce. Eventually, the situation was rectified, but without human resources on board, the shop floor would have struggled to implement the new cell layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another example of cross-functional buy-in involved efforts to reduce downtime at a company supplying the aerospace industry. In this instance, the daily tracking of data on various glasswalls revealed that a significant amount of downtime was occurring in the early morning hours. The root cause of this was a production-line shift start time of 5 a.m., while most engineers arrived to work between 7 and 8 a.m. The result was that if equipment went down for even a minor stoppage in the first 2 hours of the shift, the situation would not be investigated until 7 a.m. at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Faced with this problem that lean &amp;quot;created,&amp;quot; the heads of manufacturing and engineering met to discuss possible solutions. The outcome was the implementation of a six-week rotation schedule in which a handful of engineers came to work at 5 a.m. Uptime improved, and engineers learned to live with an earlier start time. However, without the involvement of the director of engineering, the shop floor would have struggled to achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are just two examples that show the importance of the reliance on other functional areas when deploying lean. This cross-functional involvement typically does not happen on its own, as everyone is busy focusing on their job. Instead, it will require the deliberate actions and forethought of all senior managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One method a new manager can use to achieve cross-functional buy-in is to invite department heads to kaizen workshop report-outs. This will give everyone a sense of the changes that are occurring, thereby preparing them for the moment when the change will rely on their team for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another helpful technique is to invite department heads to gemba walks in which metrics are reviewed. These weekly meetings cover the pertinent quality, cost, delivery, safety and morale (QCDSM) metrics for each cell. This activity not only will get these individuals physically on the shop floor, which is never a bad thing, but by focusing on shop-floor driven metrics, they will understand what data is being tracked, what challenges may lie ahead and how they can help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Past Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, a third common reason a new manager may struggle to find lean implementation success with a new employer has less to do with the new company itself and more with the manager&amp;#39;s skill set. A lean professional&amp;#39;s ability to transform a traditional manufacturer into one that embraces the kaizen philosophy is greatly correlated with whether that person was part of a company&amp;#39;s lean transformation from the ground up as opposed to joining an already well-working production system. The more involved an individual was with creating the building blocks that produced a lean culture, the more apt he or she will be in implementing lean at another company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, learning how to implement lean from the ground up is not impossible. After all, U.S. managers had to learn this from the Japanese. However, it will require extra effort and focus on behalf of the new manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A most useful tool to overcome this challenge is the creation of a steering committee. Meeting weekly, this group&amp;#39;s role is to identify and solve implementation challenges that will inevitably rise. The more these are understood at the leadership level, the more likely it is that solutions will be forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A crucial aspect of implementing lean is to anticipate roadblocks before they occur. Once it is understood what a company is up against, steps can be taken to correct the situation. Sometimes this may be as simple as reaching out to colleagues to seek their input. At other times, it might involve difficult internal discussions as new production methods are tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing is certain: Lean implementation is always a team effort, and when carried out in a deliberate and experienced way, it can be a lot of fun, as an unprecedented level of excitement and productivity is brought to the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Designing Your Own Lean System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lean systems are great and can make a company prosper. They improve quality, eliminate wasteful activity and increase value to the customer. The problem is that many managers often want to &amp;quot;carbon copy&amp;quot; lean systems. This is why I believe many of the companies who claim they are lean show no long-term improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota (TPS) and Six Sigma are no doubt the most popular lean systems. Their names are (and should be) held in high praise. These are great programs, but they were developed, designed and intended for Toyota and Motorola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a manager wants to make his or her company lean, that person should explore and understand many different lean theories, tools and production systems. There is a great deal of lean information out there, and some of the theories and tools blow the dominant two out of the water. A manager who is dedicated to making the lean jump should not implement any previously attempted (successful or not) specific system structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After researching and getting a firm grasp of lean and the commitment required to make it successful, I believe a manager should form a system design team. The team should consist of the strongest leaders in the organization. Supervisors, engineers and shop-floor personnel should be strategically chosen for this system development process. Hiring a lean specialist for the duration of the development is a good idea as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, the selected team should be introduced to the concepts the manager prefers. After this introduction, they will definitely require material to cover. A list of websites to visit, important definitions, theories and proposed tools should be supplied. A couple of lean books will strengthen their knowledge, too. Team members should have a couple of months to research and discover lean themselves, while the manager should be committed to answering questions and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The months that follow the initial learning process will not be easy. Lean systems are complex, and the values must permeate into every facet of the company. Lean will engage every individual and will demand changes in the way things were done in the past. Individuals will have disagreements about the processes, procedures and some of the tools you develop. Therefore, it is important that the system is built to allow flexibility because some of the disagreements may be valid. The lean system itself should not be sheltered from change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The newly designed system will not be void of fault or difficulty. I fear this is the central reason that managers resort to carbon-copying. Designing a blueprint for a system and implementing it takes plenty of hard work and commitment, especially in its beginning stages. It is unquestionably a learning experience, and the system will undergo many changes. As long as the basic lean principles are taught, followed and measured, the lean system will thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that Toyota and Motorola didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lean system when they started. They had to research, develop and manipulate it to reach their goals. Lean has been proven time and time again. Its concepts and theories work well and are not difficult to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is not about slogans, catchphrases or colored belts. It&amp;rsquo;s about creating, imagining, implementing and learning how to reach efficiency goals. No system in the world will be a perfect fit, so create your own organizational lifeblood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/KC0m5qG1KjY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Don't Let a Lean Vision Become Stagnant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I have been a developing change agent at my company for years now. I have saved my company a lot of money and have been promoted twice. I have had the opportunity to be trained by multiple lean consulting firms and have traveled to Japan, Mexico and California for continuous-improvement training. I consider myself pretty fortunate that my superiors saw something in me that was worth investing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that being said, I still struggle converting others to the continuous-improvement way of thinking. I know that I am not alone. I have been in frequent conversations with others who have the same issue. I think this is something that many change agents struggle with every day. It is frustrating and somewhat discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I personally have seen supervisors and managers squirm when I attempt to have standard work and process management discussions. I have seen leaders dig to uncover reasons not to move forward because it is easier to stay the same. If the amount of effort were put into evolving instead of maintaining the current state, most organizations would be exceptional ones. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to maintain an outspoken passion for lean when everyone around you seems to loathe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, some of the lean transformation elements must be implemented by management, and it still boils down to what measurements are put into place. However, I truly believe that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such resistance to lean culture and system changes if the viewpoint was slightly altered. I have come to realize that sometimes concepts that have been discussed for months with little success can be presented in a slightly different style and be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Coke and Pepsi changing their logos. They change every couple of years to keep their products fresh and interesting for the consumer. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to me that the slight change in the packaging generates huge sales. This is a good strategy for lean change agents as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean advocates have to keep their product fresh and interesting. As advocates, we must develop new ways to illustrate the concept and display the benefits. Show others how lean will streamline their processes and ultimately make the job more rewarding and easier. We need to keep the vision dynamic and interesting; we can&amp;rsquo;t let the vision become stagnant. Sometimes the sheer passion, conviction and creativity that we display in tandem with sleek &amp;ldquo;packaging&amp;rdquo; can encourage others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop new ideas as frequently as you can. Present them to management, supervisors and even shop floor personnel with conviction and excitement. Give multiple examples that can be understood by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be your organization&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;lean street preacher.&amp;quot; Make powerful slide shows or flip charts filled with information. Explain all of the benefits and savings. Make it painfully hard to say no. Unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it, no will still be a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; is what frequently gets the advocates disheartened. It gets incredibly tiring when you are attempting to construct a prospering lean company and no one wants to focus or do their part. It is frustrating when you are speaking in a language few in the organization understand. It can be exhausting to develop processes that return to the original wasteful state after a week of success. Without a doubt, these examples beat the advocate down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, we must continue to broadcast that a continuous improvement culture and lean systems will help our organizations prosper. Even if we are considered the outcasts for a while, it will be a great reward when the light switch is turned on. So hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/it_fk9wV8h4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Tips for Greater Workplace Efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We all know the old saying that time is money. It&amp;rsquo;s true, especially in the world of manufacturing. The more time you waste, the more it costs to make your products and the less profit your business has to take home. Likewise, the better you get at working efficiently, the better your profits will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does this mean for your business? What can you do to improve the efficiency level of your processes? To help answer these questions, here are five tips for greater workplace efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Thoroughly Train Employees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Educated employees are more efficient employees. A lot of manufacturing inefficiencies come down to the same root problem: lack of understanding. Everyone in your company needs to know your products, from the assembly line to the boardroom. That&amp;rsquo;s why you need to take the time to thoroughly train all employees with hands-on education that ensures they are completing tasks as efficiently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Find Ways to Reduce Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every minute that your employees are standing around with nothing to do is a minute lost for productivity. Finding ways to minimize downtime is key to making the most of your resources. Here are a few ideas for getting started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Track Everything: &lt;/strong&gt;Without proper planning and documentation, making decisions about efficiency will be tricky. Arm yourself with knowledge by tracking how much time is spent on each task and how much time is being wasted. Then, when you attempt to address those issues, track changes to see if downtime is reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize: &lt;/strong&gt;List all the job tasks happening on the production line and analyze them to see what they&amp;rsquo;re actually accomplishing. Which repetitive tasks are addressing problems and which are addressing symptoms of bigger problems? Work to prioritize tasks in order of importance and communicate this to your staff so they know what to work on when task B is done, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Automate Where Possible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many parts of your business can be automated without sacrificing quality &amp;mdash; like accounts payable, for example. If you use an e-commerce or inventory-control solution, you minimize the amount of man-hours going into the project. This goes for other areas of your company as well. Look around and see what processes could be automated to save time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Minimize Hands-on Customer Service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customer service matters in any industry, but you can still save your company the highly involved, highly costly procedures of sticking to all manual responses. Find ways to promote customer self-service, possibly through an online secure portal where simple questions can be answered without call-ins. Also, make product order status available online so clients can stay updated without needing to pull your staff away from their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Empower Managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Delegate some of the efficiency improvement to your managers by giving them the tools they need to make real change. Make it so that when they find inefficiency or waste, they are able to do something about it without needing to go through extensive red tape. This speeds up the efficiency process and gets your managers involved in improving company operations, which benefits their work experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you think your manufacturing processes could benefit from these tips? Try them for yourself and see if your overall efficiency doesn&amp;#39;t increase as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Eliminate Waste with Lean Business Model</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The United States has created levels of wealth well beyond any other civilization in history, yet much further potential is sitting right under our noses. This potential lies in lean thinking; that is, the lean business model. Applying the lean business model across the board would lead to immense productivity improvements and create an environment of deflation (a deflationary economy) and very significant wealth creation. This situation would replicate the near-zero inflationary period the United States benefited from during its first 135 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a historic view, inflation was and remained very small throughout the first century of our country&amp;rsquo;s existence &amp;mdash; even up until around 1910. During this same time, income increased substantially as the country industrialized from both an agricultural and manufacturing standpoint. Much of this was driven during the Industrial Revolution, which significantly increased manufacturing output but also greatly improved agriculture output and efficiencies due to better distribution networks and the ongoing mechanization of the agricultural industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this part of our country&amp;rsquo;s history, we benefited from what I call quasi-deflation; that is, though prices did not necessarily decrease, they increased at a dramatically low level over the course of many years (in fact, decades), while income that Americans earned increased substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although deflation is typically viewed in trepidation, in the past it has been&amp;mdash; and can be in our future &amp;mdash; a truly beneficial function. It may be viewed as price stability, enhanced buying power and value-adding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deflation can be defined in two ways: as a decrease in the overall price of goods and services, or as a decrease in the money supply and credit. While the second definition is considered classical economics, this discussion will use the first definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying lean is about removing waste from the system. By removing waste, work-in-process decreases, productivity increases, lead times decrease, quality improves, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To summarize, lean reduces the cost of any product or service by eliminating waste in the development, production and distribution of these products or services. In other words, it reduces cost (notwithstanding the cultural impact and change that must go hand in hand with the cost-improvement aspect). So with all things being equal, if costs of all products and services decrease via the lean business model, that would, in turn, drive prices down over time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many products and services actually follow this model from a deflationary standpoint. For example, electronics are in a constant state of price decrease while their performance, features and quality are improving. Think of the price of iPads, HD TVs, cell phones and the like. The prices on these products can drop on a monthly or weekly basis. Obviously, improved technology is what drives price reduction in this case, combined with free-market competition. But couldn&amp;rsquo;t any product have the same pattern if lean was applied? Maybe it would not be as drastic of a price reduction or over such a short timeframe, but there is no reason why eliminating waste (costs) over time in a competitive free market could not have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned above, our country&amp;rsquo;s history has shown that it can and has happened. Anyone who has been involved with a deep implementation of a lean business model understands the magnitude of waste that infects all business &amp;mdash; be it manufacturing, service, government, design or distribution. For as much as we, as a nation, have yet to create, we near equally have yet to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/Vx1-qDNJj3Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicate to Build World-Class Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is the real objective of Lean Six Sigma? When I ask this question, I usually get responses such as increased quality, improved speed, reduced cost, reduced errors and many other tactical improvement measures. Those are all benefits to continuous improvement (CI). The real goal of CI is to build a culture or improve a culture. As Dr. Womack wrote in &lt;em&gt;Lean Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, the fifth principle of lean is culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does it mean to build a culture or to enhance the culture? How does a world-class culture behave? A world-class culture has an engrained tendency to seek out, identify and drive improvements at all levels of the organization. It moves from a culture where lean and Six Sigma are something to be done (like a project) to a place where Lean Six Sigma is simply the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you are engaging your CI plan, ask yourself what your culture is like. Are you doing CI or is CI simply the way things are done? This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to figure out, so don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time dwelling on it. Either you are or you aren&amp;#39;t. Either answer is OK. Just recognize where you are and where you are trying to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of the equation in building a world-class culture is to engage people at all levels of the organization. Leaders must tie everyone into the plan for the CI process. They must get people involved, ask them for help and support them through the change. In short, leaders must lead them through the process. Communication is the first step to doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have developed your CI plan for the division, plant or department, tell people about it. Share it with those around you and those who work in the processes that will be affected. Tell them what you (with their help) are going to do. In so doing, you are absolutely obligated to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them why you have this plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them what is in it for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can&amp;rsquo;t stress these two items enough. If you are going to build a culture and truly reach where you are trying to go, you must get everyone involved and singing from the same sheet of music. You must get them onboard with the plan if they are going to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many management teams still employ demand and direct tactics. They use pressure to get things done. While this can be effective, it usually does little to engage the culture or endear the personnel to the organization. Engage and empower your team members if you want to accelerate the velocity of the CI plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another part of the communication process is to post the information on the wall, on the shop floor and wherever you have a facility board. Put the plan, targets, progress and results together in one place. As you can, have communications at that place and talk about it. People want to know how they are doing, what is coming up next and how they are involved. People want to hear about results and plans. They want leaders to point out when things are going well and when things need to be improved or changed. People want to know where they stand. It is the leaders&amp;rsquo; job to have open and honest communications with them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you communicate and post the plan, you are almost ready to start executing. Before you do, however, you also need to make sure that all of this work doesn&amp;rsquo;t become &amp;quot;window dressing.&amp;quot; How are you going to communicate going forward? How are you going to share the wins, challenges and opportunities going forward? How are you going to hold yourself and your team accountable? What are you going to do to keep people fully engaged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not going to tell you the answer, but I will offer some very strong advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I once heard about cowboy leadership principles, &amp;quot;If you are leading a herd of cattle, take a look around every once in a while and make sure they are still following you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/2VEx_5YhIFo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Seize Opportunities to Improve Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lean efforts used to be 100-percent directed at the shop floor. What we have seen recently is that lean is moving into non-traditional areas of business. A lot of our recent work has been in maintenance, procurement, distribution, engineering, the office and even the company kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A friend of mine recently sent me an article about how Starbucks is realizing benefits from lean efforts in its stores. The coffee-shop giant is doing spaghetti charts, videotaping the work effort and working to reduce the time it takes to process an order. If Starbucks can shave 20 to 30 seconds off an order process that takes 1 minute, 45 seconds, that is a 23-percent improvement. Multiply that by 1,000 orders and you have saved nearly seven hours of effort. That&amp;rsquo;s certainly enough to save overtime, do more with less and spend more time making customers happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, please keep in mind that the goal of lean is never to rush the process and make the quality worse but merely to eliminate the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So many organizations miss the opportunities to improve in almost all aspects of their business. If you can work to shave time here and there through process improvements on menial tasks, the quality of the entire process can improve, since the employee can spend more time on the important tasks at hand, work less overtime (if hourly) or, if salaried, work less hours and be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We worked with one group that had a fabrication department that received the job packets on the shop floor between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. when the operation started at 6 a.m. Despite the fact that the orders were printed every day at midnight, the orders sat in queue or on someone&amp;rsquo;s desk in queue awaiting work for nine-plus hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each day, the company was losing three to four hours of work time due to waiting on paperwork. Although they had work to do and were not idle, with a four-day lead-time, if an order lost nine hours because of paperwork, they were losing 9.4 percent of their time at the front end due to delays. It is no wonder their on-time performance was in the 80-percent range. They were starting off nine hours late just because of paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would encourage everyone to review their entire value-stream processes and find areas that are non- traditional to improve the waste. Take off your regular glasses and put on your waste glasses. You will be shocked at the opportunities that you will find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/QurYdaBavPc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Accelerate a Lean Transformation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When you are attempting to accelerate a lean turnaround or for that matter any implementation, the first item on your list should be to stop running on overload. Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not a matter of time but rather a matter of priorities. Define your goals and needs correctly, and create realistic completion dates as well as clear-cut plans. Time will take care of itself. Running by the seat of your pants creates numerous project breakdowns and a constant firefighting effort that will propagate throughout the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lean transformation in your company may be the best way to create the scenario you need for success. You need to instill processes and culture, manage events, and work at warp speed. Lean has a structure that is well-defined &amp;mdash; a proven commodity that you can follow in a step-by-step basis. Don&amp;rsquo;t let poor planning be your downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Develop Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is about people. The culture you need to develop is about bringing the decision down to the individual level. This is an important part of working at warp speed. It will also readily identify those who are not on the team and not willing to make the commitments that you need to survive. People who don&amp;rsquo;t care will not commit. On-boarding is extremely important in a turnaround, and working at warp speed will only magnify those who are not committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Maps and Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lean tools of current state, value stream and future state mapping, along with the metrics you determine, will provide the realistic guidelines you need to stop the constant firefighting and running on overload. Using these tools will also identify your customer needs and eliminate waste within your organization quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Inject Kaizen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Holding regular kaizen events that are well-structured will actually reduce the amount of meetings needed and provide clarity to the entire organization. So many times when firefighting is taking place, there seems to be a constant flow of meetings that accomplish nothing. A kaizen event incorporating the lean principles of continuous improvement creates the feeling that there is always room for improvement. Meetings gain a much higher level of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean will produce higher quality, reduce waste and generate greater efficiencies. As a result, improved profitability will be achieved. This sounds like a pretty good formula for a turnaround. Can it be done quick enough to survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The way you accelerate any process is to do things concurrently, so segment your business and employ the lean principles as identified above in each of them. Use the four key areas of the balanced scorecard&amp;nbsp;as a guideline for segmentation in a small business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Financial: &lt;/strong&gt;How do we look to shareholders? (Include bankers, vendors, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Customers: &lt;/strong&gt;How do customers see us? (Sales and marketing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Internal Process: &lt;/strong&gt;What must we excel at? (Operations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Innovation and Learning: &lt;/strong&gt;Can we continue to improve and create value? (Training)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Theoretically, utilizing these four areas and the tools described above should allow you to accelerate your turnaround four times faster. There are a couple of keys to this type of deployment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, create a balanced scorecard for the organization in order to provide clarity. I use the one-page business plan&amp;nbsp;as my tool of choice, and I would utilize it for each segment that is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, training is extremely important but seldom incorporated in a turnaround. The reason most often given is that there&amp;rsquo;s not enough time or money. However, without the skillset to drive decision-making downward in the organization, much of what you are trying to accomplish will fail. Think of the adage that you must give in order to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, lean experience is another critical factor. Few people have ever experienced a turnaround or the amount of slowness in the economy that we are experiencing now. It will be much easier to find a lean practitioner or consultant. This person or organization must participate with each of the segments to ensure that the overall objectives are compatible. In the beginning, there will be quite a bit of involvement. Soon, that participation will be reduced to training and the kaizen events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean transformation can be done very effectively and efficiently. I did not even touch on the tools of 5-S and numerous others that can effectively reduce vast amounts of waste. If you were in this situation, what tools would you use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/YR2Psc3Z9r0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Make Customers Feel Valued</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I had occasion to go to the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office recently. It was for a basic checkup, and since I am a lean guy to my bones, I want to focus on the visit from my perspective &amp;mdash; the customer. My appointment was for 10 a.m., and I arrived there promptly at about five minutes until 10. I signed the sign-in sheet, found a magazine and started reading. At about 10:25 (25 minutes after my appointment time), I was called back to the examination area, where the nurse told me to go in and wait. I then sat in the smaller waiting room for about 15 more minutes before the nurse came in to examine me. This was not the real exam; this was merely a preliminary exam. She took my weight and blood pressure and asked me if I had been feeling sick or otherwise had any concerns. This process of her visit with me took her about five minutes. So on the time scale, I had been in the office for 45 minutes and had human interaction for about five of those minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the nurse left, she told me to get comfortable, and the doctor would be right in. I turned on the TV in the room and was watching a cooking channel (they had only two channel choices). I sat there for another 30 minutes before the doctor casually breezed in. She didn&amp;rsquo;t apologize for my wait, nor did she greet me other than to ask, &amp;ldquo;And how are you today?&amp;rdquo; The doctor then went through her normal routine of checking a few things on me that amounted to about five more minutes of interaction. She then asked me if I had any questions, and I did not, so she left the room after scribbling some notes in my folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I sat there buttoning my shirt, it occurred to me that I had been there for more than an hour and a half, and had about 10 minutes of total interaction time. For illustration purposes, let&amp;rsquo;s call the interaction time with the nurse and the doctor &amp;ldquo;value-added&amp;rdquo; time and the time where I was waiting in one room or another &amp;ldquo;non-value added&amp;rdquo; time. In lean terms, this equates to a total time of 1.5 hours, and value-added time of 10 minutes. To calculate the value-added percentage, divide 10 minutes value-added time by 90 minutes non-value-added time, which comes to about 10 to 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, as a customer, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for 10 percent value-added time. I want to pay for 90 percent value-added time. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait in this room for a while and then move to that room for a while. I want to walk in and have my appointment start when it is supposed to, and I want to flow through the process from start to finish. I should have been walking out of the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office at 10:15 having completed my visit and onto my next errand or back to work. Instead, I was walking out of there at 11:30 and not feeling very good about my supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I am the customer, and I am always right, then why am I the one stuck waiting around? Why am I paying for a very expensive service and leaving there feeling completely unappreciated? More importantly, how many times will I come back to this doctor with these feelings of under-appreciation and wasted time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don&amp;rsquo;t want to suppose what this particular doctor&amp;rsquo;s office was dealing with, or what their thought process might be. Frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t care. What I do care about is that my time is valued by my vendor and my patronage is appreciated on some level. I also want to feel that I am paying for real value for the goods and services for which I pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t all of our customers want the same thing? Whether you are making widgets, providing a service or even supporting another group inside the same company, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. If you took a survey of your customers and asked them to rate your service, how would you rate? Would you be stellar at 9 out of 10, or 10 out of 10? Or, would you rank about a 3 like my doctor&amp;rsquo;s office? More importantly, if they had a choice, would they keep doing business with you? Take a minute and think about who your customers are, and ask yourself if they know you appreciate them. Do you show them that you appreciate them by trying to maximize your value to them? Do you tell them thanks for the business? If you make a mistake, do you personally reach out to them and apologize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the global marketplace continues to change at a frightening pace, you need to make sure that you (and your organization) cherish each customer that you have and that you share your appreciation with them. Additionally, look at your processes to see where your customers are stuck in waiting areas for you (your product) to show up. If you make them wait too long, they will go somewhere else with their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/EYMSdZ-ZQM8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>10 Keys for an Effective Lean Operation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my opinion and experience, there are 10 components or keys for an effective lean operation. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1)&amp;nbsp;Safety is not a slogan. It is acted upon and driven similar to quality and other key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2)&amp;nbsp;Productivity is improving 10 percent or more per year, quality metrics are improving at 25 percent or more per year, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measurements are utilized for continuous line improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3)&amp;nbsp;Visual controls are in place to help measure managing daily improvement (MDI). These would include things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quality cost delivery and service (QCDS) boards are in place and acted on daily.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Associates meet every day to review the previous day and current day.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Statistical process control (SPC) tracking is in place on key processes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Andon lights and abnormality response systems are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4)&amp;nbsp;Housekeeping is continuously improving, making sure there is a place for everything and ensuring everything is in its place with no useless clutter. Shadow boards are being used, and lines are painted on the floor for safety and as a prerequisite for standard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5)&amp;nbsp;Kaizen methodologies, the process of continuous process improvements, are linked to strategic objectives. Kaizen events are executed monthly to drive performance. Associates are involved and challenged. Resources are dedicated, and the company is utilizing a strong continuous improvement office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6)&amp;nbsp;Raw and in-process inventories, which are the amount of materials the plant needs for orders within five days, are moving toward a build-to-order focus. In short, you are building only what you need to fill daily orders. Create the flexibility to create any product, any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7)&amp;nbsp;Production schedule compliance, which is meeting the production schedule as planned, is at 95 percent or greater, and the customer service index (CSI), which measures if orders are complete and on time, is at 90 percent or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8)&amp;nbsp;Associates are provided at least 20 hours or more per year of off-the-floor or classroom training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9)&amp;nbsp;A production process is established for daily, weekly and monthly accountability. For example, this would include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Daily meetings to review the schedule, quality, cost and inventory&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Weekly financial accountability meetings&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Monthly scorecard reviews&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quarterly reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10)&amp;nbsp;The plant is always moving toward the next record in safety, productivity, quality and inventory levels. Associates are excited about creating a positive environment where people hold themselves accountable.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Win with Training or Lose Without It </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does training within industry (TWI) have to do with the current economic issues? Well, it can have a very positive impact for firms struggling with the present business conditions. Whether times are prosperous or not, any business can benefit from improving output per employee, resolving people issues quicker and more effectively, drastically trimming the time to train personnel (whether they are a new hire or long-time employee), and improving safety and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why isn&amp;rsquo;t every business leveraging TWI to reap these benefits? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but they should. TWI is also a foundation for standard work and continuous improvement; that is, it is a foundation for the lean business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The United States dropped the ball after World War II by letting TWI go the way of the buggy whip or steam engine. Many Japanese firms picked up that ball and ran with it &amp;mdash; and are still running with it today. Toyota runs with it today. In fact, that company could not be as competitive without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TWI is not just for manufacturing. It is every bit as applicable in the healthcare and service industries. It was developed by industry for industry (and service), so industry would be crazy not to use and leverage it once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past couple of years, a growing number of firms have begun to use TWI again, and the ones who are working with it seriously are garnering significant benefits. When combined with a valid business strategy, it can put a business in a position to be very prosperous when times are good, and to be stable and OK when times get tight. Where would you like your firm to be &amp;mdash; with the winners or the losers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps if TWI had never been dropped manufacturing, especially automotive, would not be in the mess it is in today. It played a significant role in saving the country once. Can it do it again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/juG6GzkdzLs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Build Processes that Drive Consistency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/7/26/8fbffc8e-2ea8-4bc9-a67b-9ec80c05cf1c_fast food.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten older, I have tried to curtail my consumption of fast food. I&amp;rsquo;m aware that the fat content, calorie counts and general nutrition levels are not the healthiest available. I know that as we age, we should watch our cholesterol, our weight and make sure that we eat healthy. I also know that my diet will directly contribute to the length and quality of my life. With all that being said, I love fast food. I am usually pretty good at keeping a balance of healthy eating and not-so-healthy eating, but sometimes I just want something that comes quickly and cheaply even though it may not be the best thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I recently decided to partake in some fast food in spite of the long-term potential health consequences. As I was standing in line reading the menu, I was watching the processes behind the counter. This particular restaurant was moving like a choreographed dance recital. It appeared that each person clearly understood his or her purpose and was executing flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All too often, however, fast-food restaurants are rather hit or miss. You never know exactly what sort of food or service you may receive. In some cases, the employees move slowly, while in other cases, they may move quickly. Sometimes the food is hot and fresh, and sometimes not so much. Sometimes you get the feeling that the employees could not possibly care less about serving you, while others are courteous and concerned professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the challenges of fast-food chains is to drive consistency. In fact, this is a key challenge in all businesses. Consistency will drive customers back to us, while inconsistency will drive them away. Whether we are serving cheeseburgers, small electronics or large engineered systems, our customers want us to be consistent. They want to know what to expect from us, and they want to know that they can count on us. They want us to do what we say, not surprise them, and deliver high-quality products and services. It is up to us to build long-term processes that drive consistency and build that confidence in our organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, if you have occasion to visit a fast-food establishment, or any restaurant for that matter, watch the processes if you can to see what they are doing. Try to see where things are located, how they are marked and how each process is defined. See if there is something you can learn from your favorite eatery &amp;mdash; especially if they are good at value delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/uacR3oLBFI4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Gain a Competitive Advantage in a Tough Economy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With the current economic environment, there is always the tendency to hunker down and try to ride the storm out, but is that the best strategy? Probably not. While there is most certainly a need to watch budgets closely &amp;mdash; even very closely &amp;mdash; and tighten up on extra activity, now is the time to take advantage of developing your current employees to help improve your operation and, in fact, all business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A growing number of companies have been actively implementing and even working to accelerate training within industry (TWI) into their everyday business practices and operations. The program is designed to enable improvements every day by everyone, create a more functional relationship between employees and their supervisor (which is translated into solving issues before they become a problem), and getting workers properly trained in record time. To summarize: Save money, leverage and enhance tribal knowledge, and make the entire business enterprise more competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TWI has a long history of success in this area. It also continues to have success with firms today. In the Midwest location where I live, a growing number of companies are effectively using TWI to meet this need. It is giving them a competitive advantage during this critical economic slowdown. These same firms are steadfast in their belief that deploying TWI skills will put them at a significant advantage when the economy picks up. They plan to be well ahead of the game, and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is typical that the businesses that did not just hunker down but put into action a plan to develop and improve themselves are the firms that not only survive through difficult periods but thrive when better times return. Many organizations are doing this right now, and my guess is that they will be reaping the rewards in the months ahead as business improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/yu-0VhCjFCA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to be Successful with Standard Work</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies say they use standard work, but actually very few do, at least in the manner that leverages lean fully at the operational level. Instead, most firms use some form of work standards or work instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequently, plants trying to implement standard work within their lean efforts will do a kaizen event and, in the process of the event, develop and post a number of forms (standard work sheet, work combination sheet, etc.) at the new cell. This action is a helpful exercise for the event but does not really help with the performance and sustainability of standard work or the continual performance of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem is that while the operators may be referenced to the new forms (this is what you need to do) or even involved in the development of the forms (the new standard work) during the event, this is not the purpose of the standard work forms or standard work for that matter. The forms are only for management, not the operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where training within industry (TWI) comes in. The operators are not going to be able to perform the new standard work (even if they were involved in the development of the forms) to the level that it needs to be &amp;mdash; to maintain the necessary stability of the process. TWI&amp;rsquo;s job instruction tool is the source of training operators in order to properly and consistently perform to meet the standard. TWI&amp;rsquo;s job method is the source of continuous improvement needed to develop and implement improvements to the process day in and day out. Traditional methods of training will not cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of good standard work is a fundamental key to lean success, but unfortunately most companies do not go nearly far enough with their effort &amp;mdash; and, in most cases, are not even aware of this. If you want to be successful with standard work, there is no alternative other than TWI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/T7JE77KJuYI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lean Lessons for a Recession</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Transforming a manufacturing business into a lean enterprise during boom times is a fun and exciting experience. Lean generates growth, new customers, market penetration &amp;hellip; all good things. In today&amp;rsquo;s world, one might ask, &amp;ldquo;How do I use lean now?&amp;rdquo; The answer is much the same as in a good economy. Lean is about identifying and eliminating waste in the operation. In my experience, there is great temptation in a declining business environment for management to condone or even encourage waste as a way to avoid the harsh realities of the business climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was recently working with a company that had a great business. Their demand was steady, their invoices were paid promptly, profits were good &amp;hellip; they were really busy. Unfortunately, their biggest customer represented almost 70 percent of their sales volume, a situation that is all too common in most manufacturing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an abrupt change in policy, their customer moved a complete project offshore, attempting to reduce costs. As a result, the company faced a sudden loss of about 25 percent of its backlog in one afternoon. The company owners scrambled to find additional sales to replace the lost volume. With great effort, they managed to convince their big customer to source additional work with them to make up for the lost project and were given several million dollars&amp;rsquo; worth of product to quote &amp;ndash; a monumental task for a small company with thin management ranks. While the owners toiled to wade through the RFQ, separating the wheat from the chaff, the plant manager struggled to &amp;ldquo;keep everyone busy&amp;rdquo; by building product for every order in hand, even those due months into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New orders began to flow. Rush deliveries were promised. There seemed to be a glimmer of hope. However, during the slow period, the plant manager had &amp;ldquo;kept everyone busy&amp;rdquo; by using all the raw materials on the floor. The products could not be shipped early, so the finished goods inventory sat in the warehouse waiting for the months to go by. Payroll had been maintained and product had been built, but cash collections were months into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make matters worse, the finished goods inventory was included as &amp;ldquo;accrued profits&amp;rdquo; by the company&amp;rsquo;s accountants, and income taxes were owed on the &amp;ldquo;profits.&amp;rdquo; No raw materials, no cash flow and no credit due to the tax liability. This was not a promising future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a recession, if your backlog begins to fall, face the music. Avoid the tempting waste of building inventory against future demand (orders that don&amp;rsquo;t exist or that may be delayed or cancelled and certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be cash for many months). Don&amp;rsquo;t commit raw materials before the customer actually will consume them. Lean manufacturers produce at the pull of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/mRiYONxjiRY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Learn through Failure for Ultimate Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Training within industry (TWI) is a micro version of &amp;ldquo;creative destruction,&amp;rdquo; a term used by some economists to describe a free-market capitalistic economy. Creative destruction means that new businesses, services or products enter and create the new markets while destroying existing ones &amp;mdash; with the overall result being beneficial. Kaizen is no different, but on a smaller scale. However, let me explain this in the context of TWI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have done much research on industrial history, specifically on Toyota, Ford&amp;rsquo;s Highland Park plant, the development of accounting and TWI. In every case, many mistakes were made during the development of all of these ventures. Kiichiro and Sakichi Toyota, as well as Taiichi Ohno, all made some very costly mistakes from financial and personal perspectives, but the difference is that they eventually learned from these errors. They also never let these errors bring them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning is suffering; it is not necessarily a victory &amp;mdash; although that does happen at times. The deepest learning comes from suffering (i.e., failure). That is the philosophy behind PDCA (plan, do, check, act).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By its nature, PDCA is an acknowledgment of failure, but a victory in learning. If PDCA was a victory, you would never have to go back through the cycle again, but that is exactly what PDCA intends for you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the process of learning: fail, learn, fail, learn, and so on. This will equate to a victory. The failure I am referencing does not mean that things go bad necessarily; it means that a solution or a perfect solution is not reached. This is why Toyota frequently refers to these &amp;ldquo;tries&amp;rdquo; as countermeasures. Counter the problem and measure the results, then try again and again (PDCA). This is creative destruction at a micro level and is exactly what TWI manifests both mechanically and philosophically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TWI is a mechanical means to achieve creative destruction &amp;mdash; a pattern for a behavior. Once this behavior is learned and made into a habit, deep learning takes place and the learning cycle can become addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How does TWI achieve this? It goes back to the old analogy frequently used by Toyota folks using stair steps. &amp;ldquo;Job methods&amp;rdquo; is the vertical part of the step &amp;mdash; the change, the improvement, the experiment, the &amp;ldquo;try.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Job instruction&amp;rdquo; is the horizontal part of the step or the stabilization of the experiment upon some level of success (or learning). &amp;ldquo;Job relations&amp;rdquo; provides an environment where both the leader and the subordinate feel comfortable and confident to work together through this change-stabilization process, which is a learning process running parallel with the mechanical PDCA process of the stair steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this manner there is a symbiotic relationship between the organization and its people. The company gets an improvement (better performance). People get to contribute in a meaningful way and grow in knowledge and experience. Then each gets to further leverage the mutual benefit over and over again, thus making both better through many tiny creative-destruction cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For anyone interested in further discussion and information on this process, I highly recommend Steve Spear&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Chasing the Rabbit&lt;/em&gt;. He gives excellent examples and descriptions of how and why this process works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/fE9tuIs-li4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Streamline Your Maintenance Operation for Optimum Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If your backlog is piling up or you feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources in terms of labor and parts, it may be time to work toward lean maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance is the application of lean philosophies, methods, tools and techniques to maintenance functions. It has the fundamental goals of eliminating waste associated with labor, inventory, procedures and techniques, resulting in improved productivity and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance does not imply a slash and dash approach to cutting costs and jobs. This common method will not reduce waste or lower costs. Instead, lean maintenance philosophy decreases costs by getting rid of waste that can be defined as &amp;ldquo;anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add value to the maintenance process or service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are a few areas where wastefulness and sluggishness can crop up in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Overproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overproduction in the maintenance environment means doing any work that does not add value. Examples include performing preventive and predictive maintenance tasks more often than is necessary and redoing jobs that were not done correctly the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Areas of waste in this category include maintenance personnel waiting for equipment availability, job assignments, tools, parts, instructions, other crafts, permit approval, etc. Waiting is not a value-added activity and should be eliminated or reduced as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary travel is the result of ineffective planning and scheduling. This could involve a trip to the maintenance shop to get technical information or to the storeroom for parts and tools. Poorly designed preventive maintenance (PM) routes are also a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Process Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When performing a breakdown repair, maintenance personnel are typically under a lot of pressure to fix the equipment as quickly as possible and often are not given enough time to fix the equipment properly. This results in a poor repair and a recurring problem. Properly performed repairs can eliminate this process waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most organizations now use some sort of computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM). Process waste also occurs when inefficiencies exist in these systems. For example, a poorly designed system may call for multiple entries of the same data, or a material requisitioning process could require redundant approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In maintenance, a defect can be defined as leaving an asset in an unreliable condition. There are many causes of defects in the maintenance environment. Defects due to poor workmanship arise from insufficient training, inadequate/outdated procedures and not having the proper tools to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Spare Parts Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most storerooms contain a significant amount of obsolete inventory. This ties up capital and consumes management resources. It can easily amount to 10 to 20 percent of annual inventory dollars. Keep in mind that excess inventory is not obsolete but is inventory maintained at unnecessarily high levels. Excess inventory also ties up capital and consumes management resources. In addition, inadequate PM programs cause equipment failures, which in turn results in the need for more parts (consuming working capital) and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A CMMS/EAM can monitor and control a spare parts inventory. It will keep track of inventory items, vendor performance, parts receipts, issues and returns. In addition, a CMMS/EAM can automate the parts purchasing process. Vendor managed and stocked inventory can also drastically reduce the parts quantity in the storeroom and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While breakdowns and failures are never planned, they can cause the loss of productivity and money. Finding the root cause of a failure provides an organization with a solvable problem. Once the root cause is identified, a fix can be developed and implemented, preventing a recurring failure situation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Your Plant Should Implement 5-S</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the basic tenets of manufacturing is there is never a shortage of challenges. When times are good, the challenge is how to make more on-time deliveries with the least cost possible. In this current economic environment, the challenge is how to make on-time deliveries with the resources available. Regardless of the economic environment, on-time delivery of profitable products that meet the customer expectations is the objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As companies reduce employees, it gets more difficult to meet the objective. People with the knowledge of certain tasks leave the business, just as those tasks seem to become more critical to meeting customer expectations. Some tasks are now performed by people who have to be trained to do those tasks or are done by people who have not done the task for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the simplest ways to make sure tasks can be performed simply and easily by a number of individuals is through workplace organization. This does not necessarily require new equipment, but rather the tools required to do the task are organized in such a way as to be easy to identify, obvious in their proper function in the process and noticeable if not returned to their proper place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organization is not only about the physical workplace. Done properly, it also organizes the mental approach to the task. There are many techniques used to accomplish this, from suspending the tools from above the workstation to shadow boards and foam inserts. The best solution is determined by the task and how the operator needs to access the tools. The point is to lay out the workstation in order to make it simpler for the operator and easier for him or her to perform the task properly (rather than improperly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the proper workplace organization, it becomes easier to do the task and easier to train new operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, one of the most popular approaches to workplace organization is 5-S. This approach was originally developed as a part of the body of knowledge now labeled as lean manufacturing. You can find out more about it in the book &amp;ldquo;Five Pillars of the Visual Workplace&amp;rdquo; by Hiroyuki Hirano. In English, the five steps are sort, straighten, standardize, shine/clean and sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/VjrFqMKsvaM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Start Lean Journey by Planning the Trip </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I speak with people about lean programs, I am often asked, &amp;ldquo;Where should we start?&amp;rdquo; While this sounds like a very simple question, it actually requires a lot of thought. However, the simple answer is that you must first decide where you want to go before you know where you should start. Think of it like this: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you want to go, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you have a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have a GPS for my car that is pretty high tech. It communicates with satellites that are orbiting thousands of miles above the Earth. It can tell me where I am, give turn-by-turn directions and even tell me how fast I am going. However, with all of that technology, if I can&amp;rsquo;t put in a final destination, the GPS is pretty useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same is true for lean, Six Sigma or whatever you call your continuous improvement effort. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you are trying to go, even the best lean program won&amp;rsquo;t help very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are mountains of information about lean, Toyota Production System and continuous improvement processes out there. You can read a book a week and probably spend several years digesting just what is written so far. You can hire consultants that can make a process lean down to the tenth of a second, and you can save a lot of money. You can even teach some of your folks about lean in the process. All of these things are good, but they are not exactly what we are after &amp;ndash; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should be able to very clearly and concisely articulate where it is that you want to go before you do any of the things above. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t start yet. When I ask this simple question to companies and people who ask me where to start, I usually get answers that may be accurate but aren&amp;rsquo;t really relevant. For example, I might hear, &amp;ldquo;We want to get better,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We want to save money.&amp;rdquo; While those are things that lean can help achieve, neither of them paints the picture of what you want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can read some of the lean and continuous improvement books out there to get ideas or talk to some lean professionals, but be sure to decide where you are trying to go before you take off on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the things you should consider include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have I gone through a reorganization that could impact the quality of my product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is changing on the economic landscape that will impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What new changes may come out of the new government administration that may change my business model?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What opportunities are being created right now that we need to capitalize on for the future?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are there &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; issues that may impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How old is our product offering, and is it time for a review?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the long-term corporate strategy, and how do we support that strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many other items that you should discuss as a team when formulating the vision for a continuous improvement program. The point is to have the conversations now before you start. Make sure you can clearly and consistently articulate what is important and what you are working toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge for you and your colleagues is to be able to clearly answer and articulate an answer to the question, &amp;ldquo;Why are we embracing continuous improvement?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/BiagquYOqmA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Waste to Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems as if new weight-loss programs and products come out every week. One of the latest is a plastic wrap you place around your stomach. If you strap it around your stomach, you will sweat and lose weight. Brilliant! Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably sweat if you wrap anything air-tight around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the more interesting thought is to wonder why we fall for this stuff over and over when we all know the basic concepts in weight loss, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less energy intake will reduce fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More exercise will burn fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More muscle mass will increase metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you know and understand these basic principles of weight loss, you can apply them and become very successful in losing weight. You will learn that it takes hard work to improve your metabolism and that it is a long-term lifestyle commitment, not a short-term project. This sounds awfully similar to reliability improvements, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Perhaps that is because both topics are maintenance, just with different equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is one of the newer concepts or buzzwords around maintenance. The lean philosophy encourages us to look at waste. What is waste in maintenance? Typically (not always), the largest waste is environmental and safety issues, followed by downtime of production equipment. There are also other losses such as damage due to catastrophic failures, wasted labor due to poor management system, high cost of parts and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key in the lean philosophy is to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we reduce waste?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that we improve equipment reliability. As we all know, the key elements to improve equipment reliability are to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning and scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spare parts management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technical database&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Root-cause analysis practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering and design with consideration to reliability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills development on all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept &amp;ldquo;lean maintenance&amp;rdquo; and all other new reliability improvement concepts often provide interesting angles and viewpoints, but you will end up with the same answers. To be quite honest, there are new technologies, but not much new has happened with work practices lately. The list above has been true since 1972. The hard part is doing the things in the list, not coming up with the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is just another word used to convey doing the basics, but the angle is different. I recommend reading Shigeo Shingo&amp;rsquo;s classic book &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Principles of Lean Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; and applying the basic principles to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/1GrkucLhNqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lean Principles Help Bus Company Reduce Downtime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Collins Bus Corporation in Hutchinson, Kan., recently reinvented itself through implementation of lean manufacturing principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On peak days, Collins Bus used multiple 55-gallon drums of undercoating per day. The problem was the company experienced excessive overspray of its undercoating. The overspray drifted into the plant, creating a hazard for plant personnel. The overspray also fell onto finished buses, causing additional clean-up and thus additional production delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to these issues, the 55-gallon drums installed in the spray booth caused further production delays, because when a drum emptied, spray operations had to stop until another drum could be installed. This took a half hour or more out of production for each changeover to a new drum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Daubert Chemical took a proactive role in helping Collins Bus achieve its objectives by first examining how it could solve the overspray situation. The result was a reformulation of the undercoating, which became Tectyl 6430. This water-based asphaltic coating with a chemical additive decreased product drag, offered better atomization at the spray-gun tip and thus reduced the overspray of the product. The new product also was formulated at a lower viscosity, allowing the use of drums or 330-gallon totes for packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These and other modifications saved up to 1&amp;frac12; hours of downtime per day in changeovers, eliminated the complications of clean-up due to the previous overspray problems and improved plant safety. The company was even recognized as a national model for workplace safety and health by OSHA and the Kansas Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/10/1bf372b6-0c5a-4617-b34a-ff27163d4904_Daubert Chemical Press Release.jpeg" style="width: 608px; height: 404px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Previously at Collins Bus Corporation, the undercoating had been delivered in 55-gallon drums, resulting in downtime when they were emptied. The modified Tectyl undercoating allowed the product to be delivered via a 330-gallon tote system. When one tote was emptied, the valve was closed and the second tote valve was opened with no interruptions to production.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Turn Around Your Company by Following a Lean Model</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Is anything working? Are you in trouble yet? Is it you, or is it the economy? The fact of the matter is, IT&amp;rsquo;S YOU! Why? You are the one that has to survive. It is your responsibility. Without change, things will stay the same. So, how do you go about initiating change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On a recent Business901 podcast, I discussed with Bob Weiner, CEO of PAS Technologies, how his company climbed from near the bottom of industry rankings to the top. What significant change did he make to leapfrog the competition? He invested the first week of his leadership in lean training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most professionals today have not been involved in a turnaround. They do not realize that turnarounds require a different set of skills and management techniques. My methods do not work for all and are just one way of doing it. You must decide on your course of action. I have been involved in several ventures, and failed at one of them. The results that I had were all different. I broke companies apart, sold some and worked through some. They were all different, with different goals and different results. And the bottom line is I lived to write about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, with my experience, what would I do if I was involved with one today? Though PAS did not create the model, they executed it, which is a much greater feat. My model may look a little different than how PAS did it, but it is similar in the respect that I would walk in and create a lean system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/9/c65c0507-336c-48c4-8c32-9c400d605d63_joe-dager-second-blog-chart.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 400px; height: 47px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people don&amp;rsquo;t respect the fact that you have to document what you are doing precisely. It really is like starting on a journey without knowing where you are at. If you would try to get directions from Yahoo Maps and typed in Indiana instead of Indianapolis, you may be only one hour or four hours away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your metrics play such an important part. How are you going to measure success? What in the short term will allow you to survive and in the long term build a business? Measuring simply by results is just not enough in today&amp;rsquo;s world. Using lean metrics measured by drivers are at the heart of making your plan effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a system focused on and driven by customers. Optimizing the value stream from their eyes and in an efficient process takes your processes to a level not experienced before. Review your past sales and processes that are performing well. Determine why and what may be different about them. This may help you identify a value stream much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mapping the future state is where we start seeing it all come together. This is the step everyone typically wants to jump to immediately. As a result, it can be easily abused, and a lot of waste can be left in the process. We make plans, and instead of having a sound basis, we use instincts and tools that are not directed and often based on what is called &amp;ldquo;tribal knowledge&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is the Japanese word for continuous improvement. It is all about idea submission, not acceptance. Kaizen has three steps. First, create a standard. Second, follow it. Third, find a better way. Create kaizen events on a weekly basis to improve on a particular area or metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A great learning tool is to start with a task that is working well, has little waste and just walk through the process. After you see how the process works, take one task that has what you perceive as a lot of low-hanging fruit. Walk through that process. The secret I believe to successful implementation is not trying to do too much at once. It is a journey made up of multiple events, or kaizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/SA-eHCkJzZA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	A professional engineering firm with more than 30 years of experience, LCE remains at the forefront of establishing reliability excellence as the preferred approach for companies seeking to improve their performance. LCE&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Powered by Rx&amp;rdquo; methodologies are inclusive of critical lean concepts and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob Fei, LCE&amp;rsquo;s president, shares: &amp;ldquo;Launching a lean services group is a natural addition to our core reliability consulting practice. Lean concepts and principles have always been core to our reliability excellence implementation methodologies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over the past several years there&amp;rsquo;s been a pull from our customers to provide support and subject matter expertise for their lean implementation activities,&amp;rdquo; explains Mark Ruby, senior vice president of LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Consulting Group (RCG). &amp;ldquo;In response to this demand, we&amp;rsquo;ve formalized our approach to lean by creating the LCE Lean Implementation Model and have also added additional subject matter expert resources to support the increased demand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Toyota Production System recognizes that operational stability is foundational to an efficient and effective production system. &amp;ldquo;LCE&amp;rsquo;s core competencies of reliability engineering and maintenance best practices deliver that critical stability,&amp;rdquo; Ruby points out. &amp;ldquo;Another key differentiator in the LCE approach is our expertise in change management. All RCG consultants are certified change management professionals.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The LCE Lean Implementation Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The LCE Lean Implementation Model is based upon four associated phases. While there is no &amp;ldquo;right answer&amp;rdquo; on which concepts should be implemented first, the LCE model recognizes that operational stability is foundational to successfully creating flow and establishing pull and therefore provides a general progression of implementation steps with stability as the first priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The progression from left to right begins with observing, organizing and evaluating. This phase is critical for establishing a business case and setting clear direction. It typically begins with an educational component and some level of assessment. Strategy deployment and effective leadership follows and is supported by a robust change management plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once a shared vision and a method for managing change have been established, the model progresses to the next phase of developing, implementing and improving. This phase begins with a value stream mapping exercise that helps focus problem solving while establishing which key lean concepts are critical for developing a path forward. Implementation activities are both system and process-based and can deliver immediate bottom-line results. As operational stability improves the stage is set for progression through the following phases of connecting supply and connecting demand. These stages focus on material flow, JIT and production-leveling concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the process the model focuses on developing effective leaders with a clear vision who create, engage and lead a highly motivated and involved workforce through the transformation. Over time, a culture of continuous improvement evolves, producing sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AS&amp;E Keeps Lean With Sequence Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As the demand for new homeland-security technologies continues to increase, so too does the competition among private companies vying for a piece of the market. Accommodating customer demands for fast delivery times often is the key to success &amp;ndash; or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One company thriving in the fast-changing homeland-security market is American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&amp;amp;E). The company manufactures sophisticated X-ray products used to inspect parcels, baggage, vehicles, pallets, cargo containers and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008, AS&amp;amp;E initiated a lean manufacturing initiative that continues to focus on increasing factory output and revenue while improving operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doug Capri, AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing engineering manager, says the lean initiative looks at every aspect of the manufacturing process. One of the low-hanging fruits identified as needing immediate attention was the way the company documented its manufacturing processes. Capri decided it was time to improve the documentation process with a computerized, paperless system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capri says each step of manufacturing &amp;ndash;including keeping a production record book, test procedures, quality inspections and visual work instructions &amp;ndash;was done manually in a paper-based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He says the documentation process represented 1.5 personnel headcounts over an eight-hour shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There was tremendous waste of time and paper,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;We had to manually maintain, audit and laminate each document on a daily basis before we started a build.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, Capri says the paper-based system required several pieces of software to develop the work instructions. &amp;ldquo;We had to use Word and an editing software package for the digital pictures,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;So we would normally take a picture, crop it and then paste into Word. That was very cumbersome and hard to work with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Choosing Sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a review of potential suppliers, AS&amp;amp;E chose FFD, Inc., a Knoxville, Tenn.-based software company specializing inmanufacturing work instructions for paper and electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the reasons FFD&amp;rsquo;s flagship software product Sequence was selected by AS&amp;amp;E is because it allows easy capture of AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s core manufacturing knowledge and eliminates the need for an inefficient text editor and a third-party graphics package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Sequence is an extremely efficient tool for knowledge capture, organization and management,&amp;rdquo; says FFD president Barry Lucas. &amp;ldquo;We have put all of the necessary editing tools for text and graphics right at the user&amp;rsquo;s fingertips in an attempt to eliminate whenever possible the necessity of using multiple software packages. Additionally, authors of instructions aren&amp;rsquo;t creating and formatting a document but simply organizing information on a visual process-flow tree. Sequence takes care of the deployment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We were skeptical that the software would do everything we needed,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;So we rolled it out as a pilot project on one product line and then on our more simple and stable products. It went better than expected. Now we use it throughout our plant on all three product lines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Going Paperless Boosts Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, the 1.5-person headcount once needed to maintain the different work documents has been redeployed elsewhere, supporting the plant&amp;rsquo;s lean initiatives. Capri says the newfound benefits and efficiencies of switching to a paperless system were immediate, adding that AS&amp;amp;E recouped its investment in the software within the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From both lean and quality standpoints, we eliminated the need to stop work and wait for an inspector to come to the workstation and sign in,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Now we have a qualified operator verify other assemblers&amp;rsquo; work online. So now we have quality accountability that is digitally logged in the production workbook.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is a very functionally specific piece of software designed to mimic the type of information that companies are accustomed to managing in a manufacturing environment,&amp;rdquo; says Lucas. &amp;ldquo;Before, it took a lot of time to gather and validate manufacturing information from the different systems. Now it is an integrated part of AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s overall business system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Synchronization with ERP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The paperless deployment capability of Sequence allows AS&amp;amp;E to selectively access information in a controlled and validated manner and present it to personnel on the shop floor. Every work order that is released from the company&amp;rsquo;s MRP system represents a serial number. When a work order is released from MRP, Sequence ties a specific set of instructions to that work order. The work instructions are accessed on the plant floor by work-order number and become the core of their production record book for the customer. In fact, the product will not ship without a report from the Sequence software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There are a lot of visual and visual software packages that create nice, pretty pictures and can do all the graphics, but they have no link to MRP,&amp;rdquo; Capri points out. &amp;ldquo;So if our MRP changes, if we have a design change and the bill of material changes, our paperless system is able to send us an e-mail and it also shows up in our Sequence bill of materials. That feature has allowed us to become more efficient implementing changes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as important, AS&amp;amp;E has improved consistent product processes, accountability and traceability with serial numbers to track defects back to root cause quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Time to Market for New Innovations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AS&amp;amp;E also utilizes Sequence software to document and speed up new product innovations, even at the prototype stage. This is a benefit that dovetails perfectly with AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s goals of developing options and adaptations to meet specific needs of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Now we can have the framework of a project when we do our first build,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Before we had to wait until the prototype was built and document after the fact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AS&amp;amp;E uses solid modeling for new product prototypes. Working in a three-dimensional, virtual world, AS&amp;amp;E can complete work on the model before ordering parts. Photographic images captured within Sequence give engineers the ability to tweak the design as the prototype evolves. As a result, significant time is saved because of concurrent engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We can determine the manufacturability of a product by using the model,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;We can develop a document even in the prototype stage. That has helped reduce deployment and engineering time by 15 percent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the nature of the homeland-security business, Capri says some customers require an almost impossible delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Sometimes we have to go to a second shift and bring on new people,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;This is highly sophisticated, custom-built equipment that goes to certain locations because of security concerns. Because operators can see everything on a computer monitor, it helps with the learning curve. This has allowed us to also have a more flexible workforce. We now have a consistent process for moving people from one area to another quicker with less training.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Just-in-Time Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the paperless system allows AS&amp;amp;E to implement lean changes more quickly than a paper-based documentation system. Capri says if a new way to improve efficiency is found in one assembly cell, it is easily adopted into the Sequence software system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have a value-stream mapping process,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;If the guys on the plant floor come up with a new way to do something, we can document that very quickly and release it to the next work group quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These changes, as well as the entire production record, are instantaneously available to Department of Defense (DOD) inspectors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The old production record books were handwritten,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented barcode readings to record serial numbers right into Sequence. That reduces the chance for error when we get audited by DOD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capri says the company&amp;rsquo;s lean initiative is on track for even more improvements, but the bottom line is this competitive international market oftentimes comes down to cycle times and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Sequence is part of the overall process that has helped reduce cycle times by two weeks,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Our customers want the products right away, and if we can&amp;rsquo;t deliver, they will go to somebody else.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/tTGLdeg-ibw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Husqvarna Turning to Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The world&amp;rsquo;s largest producer of lawn mowers, power tools and trimmer, Husqvarna,&amp;nbsp;knows a thing or two about cutting and pruning. When it came time for a more efficient approach to production at Husqvarna &amp;ndash; in this case, trimming production time at its plant in Beatrice, Neb. &amp;ndash; the company turned to Lean Manufacturing experts Rucker &amp;amp; Associates for impressive results. So impressive that Husqvarna recently invited Rucker to share its Lean manufacturing efficiency measures at the company&amp;rsquo;s largest U.S. site in Orangeburg, S.C.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In recent years, growing customer demand necessitated improved efficiencies at Husqvarna&amp;rsquo;s Beatrice plant for the company to expand production. Implementing Lean Six Sigma strategies helped Husqvarna increase production capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to David Rucker, the Beatrice production line features multiple equipment models, each requiring unique assembly methods and different amounts of dedicated assembly time from the operators. Using Lean principles to balance production flow, Rucker&amp;rsquo;s team created a more visual and flexible assembly line, delivering only the next two hours&amp;rsquo; worth of raw materials. Rucker is president of Rucker &amp;amp; Associates whose team specializes in finding industrial and operational efficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;By changing the way operators worked on the line, we were able to make it easier for Husqvarna to accomplish more, increasing the overall efficiency,&amp;rdquo; Rucker said. &amp;ldquo;These types of changes make a huge difference in all aspects of the business, from reduced labor costs to on-time delivery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Orangeburg site is next in line. According to Rucker, it provides a greater challenge simply because of the size of the plant, at&amp;nbsp;1 million square feet.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have been thrilled to improve Husqvarna processes in Beatrice,&amp;rdquo; Rucker said. &amp;ldquo;We believe we can achieve similar results at the cornerstone of their U.S. presence in Orangeburg.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Raleigh, N.C., Rucker &amp;amp; Associates is a high-performance consultancy dedicated to helping companies discover dramatic new efficiencies using Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma improvement methodologies. Rucker&amp;rsquo;s hands-on mentoring process with clients produces dramatic results &amp;ndash; training teams to accelerate change and implement continuous improvement. Every Rucker project features an unconditional guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Husqvarna Group is the world&amp;#39;s largest producer of outdoor power products including chainsaws, trimmers, lawn mowers and garden tractors. It is the European leader in consumer irrigation equipment under the Gardena brand. The Group is also one of the world leaders in cutting equipment and diamond tools for the construction and stone industries. Net sales in 2009 were SEK 34 billion and the average number of employees was 15,000 in 42 countries.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Brady to offer online training on lockout/tagout compliance, visual workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This week, Brady Corporation announced the debut of its new eLearning training program, a series of Web-based training courses on workplace safety and productivity. Brady launched the eLearning platform with two comprehensive training modules: a lockout/tagout compliance program and a visual workplace program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At $29.95 per course, the lockout/tagout and visual workplace eLearning programs offers employers an affordable and convenient solution to meet the growing need for employee training &amp;ndash; without the cost of travel and days off of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interactive training courses aid learning with real-life scenarios, quizzes and reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Brady&amp;rsquo;s eLearning courses offer a number of interactive features to facilitate learning and comprehension, including real-life application situations and on-the-spot quizzes. With graphics, flash animation and hundreds of photographs from actual facilities, the courses provide tangible examples that participants can relate to in their existing job responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Designed as a self-directed learning experience, the eLearning courses are available 24 hours a day via the internet. Participants can save their course progress and come back to complete the training at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For managers, the courses also feature a number of convenient reporting options for monitoring the training progress of their employees. Managers can assign courses, send reminder emails and generate progress reports all within the eLearning platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockout training module provides instruction for a safe and compliant lockout program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As a leader in lockout/tagout compliance devices and services, Brady launched the lockout training program to round out its complete offering of lockout/tagout solutions. The Lockout/Tagout eLearning module is a two-part training program for all employees involved in lockout/tagout activities in a facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first course is specifically designed for authorized and affected workers, which are the employees who will actually be performing the servicing and maintenance activities on de-energized equipment. It provides a comprehensive review of how to safely perform lockout activities in line with OSHA requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second course is intended for corporate safety leaders, or the employees responsible for managing the lockout program. It reviews key learnings from the first course, and trains participants on the proper requirements for developing, implementing and sustaining a safe and compliant lockout/tagout program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual Workplace modules train employees to use visuals to sustain lean improvements &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Visual Workplace eLearning program consists of three individual training modules, each designed for lean managers and their employees. With a module on visual workplace, 5-S workplace organization and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), the program provides a comprehensive review of visual workplace techniques and best practices, and teaches employees how to sustain lean improvements by incorporating visuals into their existing 5-S and TPM activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the first module, &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Visual Workplace,&amp;rdquo; employees learn the fundamental concepts of a visually-instructive workplace and learn how to identify, create and maintain visuals throughout a facility based on visual management tools and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Apply lean principles to training and learning</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Did you know that most training and learning programs are 85&amp;nbsp;to 99 percent&amp;nbsp;waste? Hard to believe, but it&amp;#39;s true. Just like in manufacturing, lean principles can be effectively applied to them and eliminate streamline activities, reduce costs and improve quality. In this video, Todd Hudson talks about how the classic wastes of &amp;quot;overproduction&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;delay&amp;quot; apply to training and learning and how to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Purdue to offer lean manufacturing, Six Sigma training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Purdue University again in 2011 will offer training in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma practices for which professionals can earn certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The courses, sponsored by the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, part of Purdue&amp;#39;s Technical Assistance Program, are for those currently working and for displaced professionals. Those who are unemployed may be eligible for training funds to pay for some of the courses and should check with their local WorkOne office for eligibility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Six Sigma Green Belt and Six Sigma Black Belt courses combine a detailed roadmap with statistical tools to resolve critical business issues. These are recommended for owners or management teams, engineers or technical staff from small to medium-sized companies. Participants should have some knowledge of basic statistics.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Green Belts typically work in teams to implement improvements. Black Belts independently apply more sophisticated tools to guide improvements throughout a business or organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Advanced Manufacturing (Lean) Practitioner training focuses on waste removal from production or office processes. It covers principles of lean manufacturing, the 5-S visual workplace, principles of stream mapping, quick changeover/setup reduction and total productive maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Training will be held in Evansville, Fort Wayne and Indianapolis. Course specifics and registration information are available at mep.purdue.edu/events. Displaced professionals seeking to apply for training funds should print course brochures from the website and take them to WorkOne for review.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center provides technical skills development and implementation services to manufacturers who want to increase productivity and profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, and advance work-force skills. Areas of expertise include advanced manufacturing processes, lean implementation, quality management systems, Six Sigma, green enterprise development and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/1D56LiE31gA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Gemba Research, Kaizen Institute combine forces to become global lean resource</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Gemba Research and Kaizen Institute announced that they will join forces to form the longest-running and most geographically diverse lean management consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The merger of our two companies allows us to provide our clients with local expertise in all key and developing markets,&amp;quot; said Bud H. Cox, president of KICG. &amp;quot;This will enable us to expand smoothly from 25 to over 30 worldwide locations by the end of 2011, as our clients are pulling us into more regions and industry sectors than ever before.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen is the philosophy and practice of continuous improvement by involving every person within an organization in innovation, creative thinking and practical problem solving. Organizations of all types worldwide have adopted the kaizen philosophy to achieve breakthrough results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen Institute founder Masaaki Imai, who has studied and taught kaizen for the past three decades explains, &amp;quot;Kaizen is a mind-set. Although many lean practitioners have kaizen in their toolbox, those who strive to live it each day are the people who are making a difference in people&amp;#39;s lives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KICG will offer an unparalleled breadth and depth of training and lean consulting services worldwide. Both firms have been helping clients implement kaizen, the Toyota Production System and kaizen-based business strategies for decades. These cultural transformations are achieved through kaizen tours of best-in-class companies, kaizen certification courses, online training in the full suite of lean tools and CI methods, business assessment/diagnostic services, and implementation of lean management systems in service, retail, education, government, banking, transportation, healthcare and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The approaches, philosophy and values of the two companies are very similar. Over the past year we found ourselves collaborating increasingly in lean transformation projects. We felt the time was right to take the logical next step to merge two operations fully,&amp;quot; said Jon Miller, co-founder and CEO of Gemba Research. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a great fit and we have hit the ground running as one team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Gemba Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gemba Research is a global consulting and training firm focused on helping companies implement continuous improvement (CI) cultures based on the Toyota Production System. Founded in 1998, Gemba brings unique insights into the Lean management philosophy, based on the bilingual and bicultural backgrounds of its Japan-raised founders, Jon Miller and Brad Schmidt. Gemba is recognized worldwide as a through leader in the fields of kaizen, lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System (TPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Kaizen Institute &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kaizen Institute (KI) is the longest-running consulting firm dedicated to kaizen and lean implementation. The company helps global and local organizations achieve optimum performance through kaizen strategies. KI was founded in 1985 by Masaaki Imai, one of the original pioneers who brought kaizen, lean thinking and an understanding of Japanese management practices to the West. His 1986 book, &amp;quot;KAIZEN: The Key to Japan&amp;#39;s Competitive Success&amp;quot;, was a bestseller and the milestone in the global spread of lean practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/UxHywCWiBhU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>One snowstorm. Three leaders. One lesson in lean management.</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The snow fell again in New York City this past Friday, and with it came a new spate of commentaries about how Mayor Bloomberg mishandled the big blizzard on December 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know the story, in the wake of a 20-inch snowfall, Manhattan streets were plowed quickly, but streets in the outer boroughs (Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island) remained unplowed for days. The mayor apologized, promised a thorough post-mortem to understand the root causes of the poor municipal response ... and then demoted and reassigned three people. Thee mayor&amp;rsquo;s approval ratings are now at their lowest point in his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In New Jersey, where up to 31 inches&amp;nbsp;of snow fell, Governor Chris Christie is taking heat for vacationing at Disney World with his family instead of returning to the state to help with its recovery efforts. He&amp;rsquo;s made matters worse by defending his decision to put his responsibility to his family first: &amp;ldquo;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change the decision even if I could do it right now. I had a great five days with my children. I promised that.&amp;rdquo; The governor&amp;rsquo;s nearly bullet-proof image, constructed during a year of tough leadership and emphasis on taking responsibility, has taken a beating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then there&amp;rsquo;s Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J. Mayor Booker was not only present during the blizzard, he personally responded to several calls for help, showing up with a shovel to help some motorists who were stuck in the snow and bringing diapers to others. The mayor kept up a constant stream of tweets so that people knew what he was doing, even asking citizens to send him tweets letting him know where help was needed. The mayor is now a hero in Newark, where he faced a difficult re-election last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PR experts will undoubtedly begin talking about best practices for crisis management (if they haven&amp;rsquo;t already). But from a lean leadership perspective, what strikes me is the fact that only one of these leaders went to &amp;ldquo;the gemba&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; the streets where the work was actually being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You could argue that a mayor has better things to do with his or her time than shovel snow (that&amp;rsquo;s why we have children, after all). But I disagree. People need to see (and in the case of Mayor Booker, hear via Twitter) that their leaders are willing and able to work in the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, Mayors Bloomberg and Booker, and Governor Christie have other, higher-level, leadership tasks to ensure that these service failures don&amp;rsquo;t recur. But it&amp;rsquo;s important for all people in the state, the city, or any organization to see that their leaders are present and doing everything they can to help ease their pain. And if the problem is something that requires specialized skills that the leader doesn&amp;rsquo;t have &amp;mdash; shutting down a nuclear reactor, tunneling into a mine shaft, performing surgery &amp;mdash; then the leader should be supporting those that do have the critical skills by bringing them coffee and donuts, or cold water, or fresh bandages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence that the salient memory of Rudy Giuliani is him standing atop the World Trade Center rubble, while the lasting image of George Bush during Katrina is him peering through the window of Air Force One several thousand feet above New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No one expected Giuliani to spend all day, everyday at the World Trade Center. No one expected Mayor Booker to spend all day, everyday shoveling snow. But people do expect their leaders to at least be present where the work is being done for &lt;em&gt;some amount&lt;/em&gt; of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean bloggers and teachers often talk about the need to get out of the corner office and the conference room and get to the gemba as part of their standard work. That need is even greater in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One snowstorm. Three leaders. One lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/UQkyFeSJUvY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	The top&amp;nbsp;five ways that companies waste money implementing Lean Six Sigma:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Top-down CEO commitment&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Widespread implementation&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Training belts and teams&lt;br /&gt;
	4. Failure to focus&lt;br /&gt;
	5. Lean Six Sigma software&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kanbans link the supply chain together</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Single-piece continuous flow is the most effective and cost-efficient way to produce or process anything. It is what lean is all about. However, we also realize this is not always possible. There are steps within the process that run at dissimilar speeds. If the process steps or equipment speeds cannot be synchronized or changed, we need to inject a buffer inventory into the systems so as to simulate single piece continuous flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanbans are signals which automate the replenishment of&amp;nbsp;repetitively used materials and supplies from internal or external suppliers to the buffer inventories. Kanbans reduce outages and shortages of materials and supplies, which improves customer service levels. Kanbans support &amp;ldquo;pull production&amp;rdquo; and continuous flow, since material is not produced at the supplier until a signal to replenish material is received from the customer. Using this approach, kanbans will reduce overall inventory levels (30 percent reduction on average).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanbans can be used anywhere in the organization where there is repetitive usage including: maintenance supplies, janitorial supplies, raw materials, office supplies,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	The type of signal used in a kanban is only limited by your imagination, but there must be agreement on the type of signal and the information it contains between the supplier and the customer. (In general, all kanban development is accomplished by negotiation, at least&amp;nbsp;for the first few kanbans, between the supplier and customer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note that kanbans are the most efficient at eliminating waste when the signals are returned from the point of use (customer) to the supplier. Sending the signal back through purchasing so they can cut another purchase order to the suppler is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a kanban system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All signals must contain the information that the supplier needs to replenish the material. The following information is typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/efc2fd3c-1d63-4591-8a0a-d4a2eb6b6061_rubrich1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note the above &amp;ldquo;number of containers&amp;rdquo; also means the &amp;ldquo;number of&amp;nbsp;kanban signals.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other information that might be included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Previous operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time/date of delivery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Where used (in what model number)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storage area (the goal is to have suppliers&amp;nbsp;deliver to the point of use)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examples of other kanban signals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/b7d9921d-b1fd-4c92-9eec-cb9d5118b20e_rubrich2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Container Kanban&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The empty container is sent back to the supplier for refilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/bb0e667e-6e42-4f71-aff8-d52506d1078c_rubrich3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Faxable Kanban&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the way to delivering this material to the production line, the material handler stops at a conveniently placed fax machine and faxes the kanban card back to the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/e301110b-a2eb-4a15-8b0c-0444fbebbcef_rubrich4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Office Engineering Plotter Kanbans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As plotter supplies are used (ink cartridges and paper), the faxable sheets are sent to the supplier (the engineers send the signals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/c6497e2e-c654-44ad-a89a-aafceeb49b95_rubrich5.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Internet Kanban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The internet kanban allows an external supplier to monitor in real time the inventory levels of a raw material that is stored in a bulk storage tank. The weight of the material is converted by a&amp;nbsp;load cell&amp;nbsp;into a fill level. The supplier then decides when to give themselves an order to produce more material, and when to ship it so the customer does not run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/066817cc-a91c-4d8b-a606-78e8c8cc0e89_rubrich6.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Shipping Trailer Kanban&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When&amp;nbsp;material usage is very high, the material is only unloaded from the trailer as&amp;nbsp;it is used. In this case the supplier has two full trailers on site. When the first trailer is emptied, the signal is sent, and the second trailer is backed up to the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When kanbans are developed&amp;nbsp;through negotiation with both your internal and external suppliers, the outcome will be a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>IC-TAG Solutions pursues lean manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	IC-TAG is part of the 33 percent of companies that have already begun with the process of changing one&amp;#39;s lifestyle for the safety and benefit of the environment. Lean manufacturing aligns perfectly with the company&amp;#39;s goals and standards, so the transition came naturally.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	By understanding the importance and impact of going &amp;ldquo;green,&amp;rdquo; the team works together to reuse, recycle, and save energy. According to Earth Share, &amp;ldquo;It has been estimated that there will be 9 billion people living on planet Earth by the year 2050.&amp;rdquo; Natural resources are becoming more scarce and costly. In order to be prepared for the new growth, IC-TAG&amp;rsquo;s goal is to help preserve natural resources by lowering costs, cutting prices and applying lean manufacturing principles and techniques to eliminate waste and drive efficiencies. Working with partners such as Avery Dennison, IC-TAG Solutions is able to return flanges back to Avery so they can reuse the material and eliminate the need to waste more plastic. By doing this, the company is protecting clients with ever increasing material costs that are incurring. With the help of the company&amp;#39;s employees, IC-TAG is able to give its share towards the environment and community in hopes of setting a positive example in conserving the environment and future. With an emissions-free warehouse, IC-TAG is able to reuse label scraps as packing filler and save energy by unplugging all electrical equipment during downtime.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	IC-TAG Solutions is embarking phase one of lean manufacturing. With the bold new direction, hope to have an increase in productivity and customer satisfaction. By purchasing labels and RFID products from IC-TAG Solutions, customers can rest assure that they are buying an economical product from an environmentally-friendly RFID manufacturer.

            <title>Timken names Folger to lead global quality organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company has named Russell F. Folger as vice president for quality advancement. He assumes the leadership role formerly held by Donna J. Demerling, who retires at the end of December after a 38-year career at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Folger has held the position of director of global quality since 2007, overseeing the implementation and management of Timken&amp;rsquo;s Quality Management System, the backbone of the company&amp;rsquo;s robust quality assurance processes. In his new role, he will be responsible for quality management systems and quality assurance throughout the company, including business processes, product design, manufacturing, supply chain and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Quality is a core value at Timken. Customers around the world rely on us wherever parts move and turn in their most critical applications,&amp;rdquo; said James W. Griffith, president and chief executive officer. &amp;ldquo;Russ brings more than 30 years of customer engineering experience to the quality organization and has worked with Timken facilities around the world. In his new role, he will ensure that we continue to live the core value of quality throughout our organization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demerling retires after a long career of engineering and leadership positions with Timken. Since joining the company in 1972 as an application engineer, she held numerous positions of increasing responsibility including president of Timken&amp;rsquo;s aerospace business and senior vice president of supply chain transformation. She also managed bearing manufacturing and distribution operations in Bucyrus, Ohio, and bearing manufacturing in Lincolnton, N.C. She has been vice president of quality since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having a customer focus throughout his career at Timken, Folger joined the company in 1979 as a sales engineer before progressing through a series of global roles in sales and application engineering, including a leadership role in the Yokohama, Japan, sales office and later serving as chief engineer and vice president of engineering for automotive markets. After moving into a leadership role in the quality organization, he worked closely with Donna to ensure a continued focus on quality throughout a time of significant global and product expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Folger earned a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in mechanical engineering from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and completed the executive development for global excellence program at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Timken Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Timken Company keeps the world turning with innovative friction management and power transmission products and services, enabling its customers&amp;rsquo; machinery to perform more efficiently and reliably. With sales of $3.1 billion in 2009, the company has operations in 27 countries/territories and approximately 17,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/tsRbeRLAiKk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Avery Dennison named as a 'Best Plant' recipient by IndustryWeek magazine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing plant has been named one of the 10 best plants in North America by &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=IndustryWeek+in+the+magazine%27s+annual+competition.&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=dc40e623c18abcf0772e5d1095810046" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek &lt;/i&gt;in the magazine&amp;rsquo;s annual competition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, a panel of the magazine&amp;rsquo;s editors and outside experts recognize North American facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction and create stimulating and rewarding work environments. This year, Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s plant, which manufactures Avery brand office products, stood out from other entries with consistently high quality, rigorous maintenance and safety results, and especially its use of Enterprise Lean Sigma (ELS) to create efficiencies, improve productivity and increase customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Tijuana is a model of a continuously learning organization,&amp;quot; said Greg Temple, Avery Dennison vice president, global operations and Enterprise Lean Sigma. &amp;quot;They have overcome significant business challenges over the years through a relentless focus on waste and process discipline, and &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#39;s recognition is very gratifying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among its accomplishments, the Office Products plant has operated with 98 percent &amp;ldquo;first-pass&amp;rdquo; yield of products; achieved nearly $6 million in documented improvement projects in 2009; and gained a total of 310,000 square feet over the last five years through ELS initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The review panel also noted that one of the plant&amp;rsquo;s outstanding characteristics is the depth of employee engagement. &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; noted the high number of employee suggestions and cited the example of production worker Azucena Robles, who proposed using a compressed air gun at a strategic point on the assembly line for Avery Glue Stics to keep the line moving while label applicators are refilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Everyone in the Tijuana plant, from the plant leadership team to the operators on the shop floor, is using creative problem-solving skills,&amp;rdquo; said Tim Bond, group vice president, Avery Dennison Office Products. &amp;ldquo;One of their products is continuous improvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; will honor the Tijuana team during a ceremony this April in Atlanta, Ga., and will feature the facility in its January issue, which is available &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=online+now&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=1eb77d1f417484f7b770f4180ca9d9a0" target="_blank"&gt;online now&lt;/a&gt;. The competition is in its 21st year and previous recent winners include Raytheon, Philips and Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Avery Dennison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Avery Dennison&amp;nbsp; helps make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent. For 75 years, the company has been a global leader in pressure-sensitive technology and materials, retail branding and information solutions, and organization and identification products for offices and consumers. A Fortune 500 company with sales of $6 billion in 2009, Avery Dennison is based in Pasadena, Calif., and has employees in more than 60 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/-dmFkslOomc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Revenues:&lt;/strong&gt; $540 million operating budget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Workforce:&lt;/strong&gt; 2,704 (1,088 salaried and 896 hourly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kansas City Plant (Kansas City, Mo.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kirtland Operations: Six locations on or around Kirtland AFB (Albuquerque, N.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Satellite Office at Los Alamos National Laboratory Facility (Los Alamos, N.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ft. Chaffee Facility (Barling, Ark.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Overall customer satisfaction has been maintained at or above 95 percent for the past four years. This level compares favorably to commercial best-in-class, whose levels range from 78 percent to 85 percent for the same period. The percentage of customers willing to continue work with FM&amp;amp;T is measured by quarter, and this has been maintained at 96 percent for the past four quarters. This level compares favorably with a commercial (private) best in class level of 95 percent for the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s governance system is the Management Assurance System used for identifying, implementing, measuring, and sustaining the &amp;ldquo;critical to quality&amp;rdquo; needs necessary for desired performance. The system is also the basis for deployment of FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s purpose, vision, mission, and values.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Customer product quality and reliability performance is segmented by traditional and non-traditional customers. The combined quality/reliability performance level has been at 99.9 percent for traditional customers for the past three years. The level for non-traditional customers has been trending upwards since fiscal year 2006 from roughly 98.4 percent to 99 percent in fiscal year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Through the Enterprise Alignment Process, the daily accountability of the salaried and hourly workforce is aligned to the FM&amp;amp;T balanced scorecard and strategic plan. These processes contribute to satisfaction scores of 72 percent for &amp;ldquo;workforce feels appreciated&amp;rdquo; compared to commercial best in class manufacturers of 67 percent, a score of 81 percent for &amp;ldquo;management listens to ideas&amp;rdquo; compared to 76 percent, a score of 72 percent for &amp;ldquo;positive environment&amp;rdquo; compared to 58 percent, and a score of 80 percent for &amp;ldquo;information provided&amp;rdquo; compared to 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s senior leader open door policy and information sharing are two of its leadership strengths. Quarterly meetings are held to share the state of the business and respond to employee questions and concerns. &amp;ldquo;Skip level&amp;rdquo; meetings and e-mail boxes such as &amp;ldquo;Ask FM&amp;amp;T President&amp;rdquo; provide avenues for employees to have direct access to senior leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s use of the Six Sigma Plus Continuous Improvement Model ensures integration of customer and business requirements into all design projects. Use of this approach has resulted in cost savings from increased productivity and deployed innovations of between $23.5 million and $27 million annually for the past three fiscal years.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T demonstrates good citizenship through employee-giving programs, such as Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the FM&amp;amp;T Employees Club, and the Christmas in October and Harvesters food collections. Employee volunteer hours donated averaged roughly 15,000 hours per year from 2006 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>EnerNOC energy management applications deployed in lean manufacturing study</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	EnerNOC Inc., a leading provider of energy management applications for the smart grid, announced December 17 that it is partnering with a Virginia Tech research group to monitor energy usage data across multiple sites in an innovative study of &amp;quot;lean&amp;quot; manufacturing strategies. The Wood Innovation Research Group will use EnerNOC&amp;#39;s web-based energy management applications to gather energy usage data from three Virginia wood product manufacturers and analyze trends in energy usage to identify opportunities for improved efficiency. Merrillat, Ten Oaks Flooring Company and Morgan Lumber will contribute data to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uniquely, this project explores integrating energy efficiency into &amp;quot;lean&amp;quot; manufacturing techniques, which are followed by leading manufacturers world-wide. Traditionally, lean thinking has been focused on reducing seven forms of waste, including transport, inventory and defects, among others. This application of EnerNOC&amp;#39;s technology aims to reveal how manufacturers can identify waste in energy use and minimize its impact on the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Since many manufacturing facilities are extremely complex, even &amp;#39;lean&amp;#39; manufacturers tend to miss the resources they waste through inefficient energy use,&amp;quot; said Dr. Henry Quesada-Pineda, assistant professor of business and manufacturing processes at Virginia Tech, who will lead the research project. &amp;quot;To advise these manufacturers, our research group required a robust data processing and analysis platform to identify wasteful energy usage across an array of sites. EnerNOC&amp;#39;s energy profiling functionality allows us to see the broader energy-use picture, as well as drill down into facility-specific usage data to inform our project.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;For many businesses, energy is an &amp;#39;unseen&amp;#39; form of waste. The results are only clear after the bill arrives each month,&amp;quot; said Gregg Dixon, EnerNOC&amp;#39;s senior vice president of marketing. &amp;quot;EnerNOC&amp;#39;s data-driven energy efficiency applications are designed to be flexible and extensible enough to serve all kinds of commercial, institutional and industrial businesses, as well as to support the research that will move the field of energy efficiency forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EnerNOC&amp;#39;s energy management applications, DemandSMART, EfficiencySMART, SupplySMART and CarbonSMART, empower users with access to real-time energy usage data. All DemandSMART comprehensive demand response customers receive basic energy profiling functionality at no cost. For more in-depth analysis, EfficiencySMART Commissioning and EfficiencySMART Insight offer further real-time visibility into energy usage and costs at a single site or across a portfolio of facilities, enabling the ability to rapidly identify and harvest a range of low and no-cost energy savings opportunities previously hidden from view, reduce energy spikes and related demand charges, optimize energy efficiency investments and strategy and enhance measurement and verification of ongoing and future energy efficiency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About EnerNOC &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	EnerNOC unlocks the full value of energy management for our utility and commercial, institutional and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) customers by reducing real-time demand for electricity, increasing energy efficiency, improving energy supply transparency in competitive markets and mitigating emissions. We accomplish this by delivering world-class energy management applications including DemandSMART, comprehensive demand response; EfficiencySMART, data-driven energy efficiency; SupplySMART, energy price and risk management; and CarbonSMART, enterprise carbon management.

            <title>A very good primer on Six Sigma principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is Six Sigma? It&amp;#39;s a systematic way to solve problems involving defects and deviation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You only need a handful of tools to solve most problems:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Control charts of current performance (and to monitor performance after improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Pareto charts (for defects) and histograms (for variation)&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Ishikawa - Fishbone diagrams for root cause analysis&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Address waste, rework, defects with 4-50 Rule</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Learn the 4-50 Rule:&amp;nbsp;Four percent&amp;nbsp;of the steps in any process cause 50% of the waste, rework, defects, deviation and lost profit. Use Pareto charts to narrow your focus to the 4% to maximize results and profit.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Manufacturers leverage lean transformation; employees emerge as top asset</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For decades, the U.S. economy has been driven by the manufacturing industry. A perennial global leader, there never appeared to be a reason to change the ways of doing business, until now. The U.S. manufacturing industry is amid a reinvention, implementing Lean Transformation as a strategy for growth, harnessing employee creativity and innovation as a key competitive advantage in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. manufacturers are joining the growing trend in changing their management strategies, realigning their organizations with a Lean culture that emphasizes continuous learning and value creation. The results are employees who feel more satisfied in their jobs and are contributing to innovative, creative solutions that are delivering greater value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three executive manufacturing leaders will share their Lean Transformation case studies with a crowd of 150-plus, fellow executives at an upcoming &amp;ldquo;Profiles of a Lean Transformation&amp;rdquo; seminar, hosted by Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center, on December 14, at Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in Lafayette Hill, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The United States represents less than 5% of the global population. Our ability to compete, create jobs and protect our quality of life will be through the quality and ingenuity of our people.&amp;rdquo; says Mark Basla, vice president of marketing and business development for DVIRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DVIRC is a leading private, non-profit economic development organization established in 1988 to serve the needs of nearly 5,000 small to mid-sized advanced manufacturing Enterprises (SME) in five counties throughout the Philadelphia region. The organization&amp;rsquo;s primary focus is to grow business value for clients through consulting services, talent development and regional, state and federal resource assistance, helping to establish the region as an internationally recognized leader in manufacturing competitiveness. We believe growing business value improves the standard of living and quality of life for those that live and/or work in the region. A diverse board of directors comprised of executives from the manufacturing, banking, legal and economic development communities govern the DVIRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/FIi_-Hhki_s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Baldrige program needs the best of the best as examiners</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Provide a valuable service to your country. If you&amp;#39;re an expert from a business, education, healthcare or non-profit organization, and possess knowledge and experience in leadership, strategic planning, customer service, human resources, process management and achieving results, you are on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Most Wanted List.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program is seeking exceptional individuals to serve on the 2011 Board of Examiners for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Examiners evaluate applications for the Award and prepare feedback reports to applicants that cite strengths and opportunities for improvement. They also act as &amp;quot;ambassadors&amp;quot; for the Baldrige Program and performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application form for the 2011 Board of Examiners is now available online at &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm" jquery1292340340147="106"&gt;www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. Applications must be submitted electronically by 5 p.m. EST on Jan. 13, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The board consists of more than 500 volunteers, including 12 judges and about 60 senior examiners representing many industries and sectors. Service on the board provides opportunities to enhance one&amp;#39;s knowledge about improving processes and achieving world-class results, develop a network of like-minded colleagues, and help improve U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the most valuable benefit to being an examiner: comprehensive training from one of the top 10 government leadership development programs as named by Leadership Excellence magazine for three years in a row. This professional development also can qualify for Continuing Education Units (CEUs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For assistance in preparing an examiner application, contact &lt;a href="mailto:examappl@nist.gov" jquery1292340340147="107"&gt;examappl@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call the Examiner Hotline toll-free at 877-237-9064 (Option 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 and is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in cooperation with the private sector. The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance management strategies. The Baldrige Award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/l552V4tzZcU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>First set of Baldrige Award criteria for 2011-2012 now online</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program has announced that the 2011-2012 Criteria for Performance Excellence for businesses and nonprofit organizations are now available for &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/business_nonprofit_criteria.cfm" jquery1292340203317="106"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. The Criteria serve both as the standard for selecting the annual recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and the road map for organizations worldwide seeking improved strategy and operations through pursuing performance excellence. The other two editions of the 2011-2012 Criteria&amp;mdash;for health care and education&amp;mdash;will be available on the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/index.cfm" jquery1292340203317="107"&gt;Baldrige website&lt;/a&gt; later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Criteria work as an integrated framework for managing an organization. They are simply a set of questions focusing on seven critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce focus; operations focus; and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;rsquo;s revisions to the Business/Nonprofit Criteria emphasized two themes: dealing with the increasing complexity of enterprise leadership and management; and improving customer engagement. The Criteria now include the concept of &amp;ldquo;intelligent risk taking&amp;rdquo; and an improved &amp;ldquo;line of sight&amp;rdquo; set of linkages that should take an organization from the strategic environment to the execution of its operations in a logical sequence. The category on customer focus has been reorganized to improve the flow of logic and now addresses the use of social media as an important contributor to capturing the &amp;ldquo;voice of the customer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness and performance of U.S. businesses. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige program is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Paper copies of the Criteria will be mailed on request. E-mail &lt;a href="mailto:baldrige@nist.gov" jquery1292340203317="108"&gt;baldrige@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call 301-975-2036.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/6Y0YJv0NMAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Food for thought: Avoid tunnel vision in the plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I was being driven around a particular site by an engineer recently when I noticed an anomaly. Something just didn&amp;rsquo;t look right with a cable tray mounted to a pipe rack. It appeared the cable tray was sagging and had broken loose from its mounting. I asked the engineer if he noticed it and he said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. So, I asked him to turn around and make another pass. Sure enough, the tray had broken loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often times, we become complacent in our surroundings and we simply don&amp;rsquo;t notice things that are changing all around us. It&amp;rsquo;s like we are wearing blinders, suffering from tunnel vision. We only look straight ahead or, worse, hang our head down when we move through the site in our travels. I bet you would really be surprised at the number of people that never look up at the ceiling. Are you one of those, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I&amp;rsquo;m at a site, I&amp;rsquo;m looking everywhere because it&amp;rsquo;s all new to me. Make your site &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; to you, too. Take the time to look up at the ceiling, at pipe supports, and to the side. Make an effort to find things that are not in their place or not normal. From a maintenance and reliability perspective, we want to inspect to find things in the act of failing and repair them from a proactive point of view before the failure occurs. Separately, 5-S is a great process to find things out of place, but what about chains rubbing on guards or, worse, rubbing through conduits? What about hydraulic and other fluid leaks? I can assure you that you would never believe some of the things I have seen people walk by every day at sites and never notice &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp;things that kill equipment reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m more conditioned to this approach as I had a manager (read mentor) who used to take me on walks throughout the site (inside and out) looking for items in need of repair or just sprucing up before a VIP tour. We looked for the simplest things like missing conduit covers, lights out or water on the floor. Why? Because finding and fixing the little things helped to ensure they didn&amp;rsquo;t become bigger and more costly things later &amp;ndash; like a slip and fall from the water on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When was the last time you walked the floor with your people looking for the littlest things to improve? Sure, we all have bigger fish to fry, like planned work activities. But don&amp;rsquo;t you see, this is another way to create a culture of continuous improvement. Open their eyes and create an expectation that even the little things matter. Strive to be the best. Make it a contest with your group to see how many &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; things they can find on your walks &amp;hellip; and then, fix them. See if you can find even more on the next walk two weeks later. Repeat that again in two weeks. Notice that you are starting to create a trend here, a &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; of continuous improvement and setting an expectation? So, what are you waiting for? Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are some techniques like this that you use to drive continuous improvement?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bayer restructuring calls attention to lean manufacturing solutions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the third week of November, Germany&amp;#39;s Bayer announced a major restructuring program designed to offset falling revenues resulting from generic drug competition and price pressures stemming from financially ailing governments&amp;#39; imposition of healthcare reforms. Bayer hopes to, by means of this thoroughgoing restructuring, free up resources to invest in growing and enhancing the company with a focus on R&amp;amp;D and marketing new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spokespersons for Bayer said that the pharmaceuticals/chemicals giant will cut costs, from 2013 on, by EUR800 million per year, eliminate 4,500 jobs, and create 2,500 new jobs, primarily in emerging markets. According to Marijn Dekker, Bayer AG Chairman, this attempt to efficient bundle resources and work toward streamlining structures is &amp;quot;the only way we can sustainably finance our investment in growth and innovation &amp;ndash; for example, in new pharmaceutical products, in our BioScience business and in the expansion of our capacities in Asia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the remainder of this fiscal year, current guidance and structures will remain in place, for an expected adjusted sales growth in excess of 5 percent and gross earnings of more than EUR7 billion. The restructuring is expected to cost approximately EUR1 billion by the end of 2012, but after that the projected annual cost savings will be EUR800 million, about half of which is to be reinvested. Dekkers concluded, &amp;quot;The cutbacks involved will not be easy, but they are necessary. I am convinced that with more innovation and less administration, Bayer can become a better and faster company.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Bayer&amp;#39;s recently announced restructuring indicates, now is the time for pharmaceutical companies to consider a lean manufacturing implementation, which involves elimination of waste, responsiveness to customer demand, and continuous improvement of quality and processes. Lean manufacturing solutions hold out the promise of freeing up the needed resources to bolster competitiveness and profitability while at the same time obviating the need to drastically slash jobs and eliminate functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smart Consulting Group has the experienced and qualified pharmaceutical consultants who can guide companies through the process of implementing lean manufacturing solutions. Their goal is to &amp;quot;provide the competitive edge you need to be the market leader in medical products.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/0k4mXR34b2o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What does a production line have to do with brain surgery?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does the production line at a car manufacturer have to do with a doctor scrubbing in for brain surgery? A lot, as it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For almost 10 years, Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle has adopted the essential principles of the Toyota Production System in an effort to improve quality, safety and efficiency. The results have surpassed all expectations. Virginia Mason ranks among the top 1 percent of all hospitals measured for efficiency, according to the Leapfrog Hospital Recognition Program, which compares 1,184 hospitals in 45 states. Efficiency is a Leapfrog measure that combines scores for quality and resource use &amp;ndash; an important way of looking at value. Chairman and CEO Dr. Gary S. Kaplan and the hospital itself have received numerous national awards and honors for quality of service. Hundreds of doctors, nurses, trustees, administrators and CEOs from 31 states and eight nations have come to Seattle to see, firsthand, how the Virginia Mason Production System (VMPS) works, and the number of requests for visits continues to increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Published on the eve of the 10th year VMPS has been in use, and immediately following the creation of the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services&amp;rsquo; new Innovation Center, &lt;em&gt;Transforming Health Care: Virginia Mason Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s Pursuit of the Perfect Patient Experience&lt;/em&gt; (Productivity Press; publication date: December 8, 2010) is Charles Kenney&amp;rsquo;s chronicle of Virginia Mason&amp;rsquo;s dramatic transformation. From the factory floor in Japan to the halls of Virginia Mason Hospital, Kenney captures the amazing story of the application of a manufacturing method to the delivery of patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is VMPS and why does it work?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The foundation of the Virginia Mason Production System is a Japanese term called &lt;em&gt;kaizen&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; continuous, incremental improvement to eliminate the waste, inefficiency and variation that plagues so many processes essential to the health care experience. Getting down to the brass tacks, this means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Fewer medical errors&lt;/strong&gt;. Inspired by Toyota&amp;rsquo;s model, every one of Virginia Mason&amp;rsquo;s 5,000 employees is now able and encouraged to stop the &amp;ldquo;assembly line&amp;rdquo; of care whenever potential harm to a patient is perceived. Since its inception, more than 15,000 Patient Safety Alerts have been called resulting in countless cases where harm was prevented.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Hearing &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rsquo;s my nurse? I buzzed her 20 minutes ago&amp;rdquo; a lot less often. &lt;/strong&gt;Before the system was implemented, studies showed that nurses were spending barely one-third of their time providing direct care to patients; today, nurses spend 90 percent of their time on direct care.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li align="left"&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;The computers do more than just store records.&lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Mason has a computerized module that sorts through electronic medical charts and automatically identifies disease management and preventive testing that is due or overdue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Less money wasted, more money spent on new equipment and training. &lt;/strong&gt;Professional liability insurance expenses declined at the hospital by 26 percent from 2007 to 2008 and then dropped an additional 12 percent the following year. Insurers have asked Virginia Mason to teach its safety methods to other medical centers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a critical moment, this book tells the story of one of the most unusual journeys in the history of American medicine. In a rousing foreword, Donald M. Berwick, MD (former president and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, head of the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services and one of the nation&amp;rsquo;s leading authorities on health care quality and improvement), writes that, &amp;ldquo;health care is hungry for something truly new &amp;ndash; less a fad than a new way to be &amp;hellip;Virginia Mason Medical Center &amp;hellip; has a better shot at becoming one than almost any other large health care organization in America today. This book recounts a journey that offers an enormous dose of hope that VMMC can demonstrate the transformed results that we so badly need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Charles Kenney is a former writer and editor at the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; and noted author of many books including &lt;em&gt;The Best Practice: How the New Quality Movement Is Transforming Medicine, &lt;/em&gt;whichthe &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; described as ``the first large-scale history of the quality movement.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gary S. Kaplan, MD, has served as chairman and CEO of the Virginia Mason Health System since 2000. He is a practicing internal medicine physician and has received national and international recognition for Virginia Mason&amp;rsquo;s work to transform health care and demonstrate that higher-quality lower-cost health care is achievable. In 2009, Dr. Kaplan received the John M. Eisenberg Award, a national recognition for commitment to patient safety and quality; and he received the Harry J. Harwick Lifetime&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Baldrige program needs best of the best as examiners</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Provide a valuable service to your country. If you&amp;#39;re an expert from a business, education, healthcare or nonprofit organization, and possess knowledge and experience in leadership, strategic planning, customer service, human resources, process management and achieving results, you are on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Most Wanted List.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program is seeking exceptional individuals to serve on the 2011 Board of Examiners for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Examiners evaluate applications for the Award and prepare feedback reports to applicants that cite strengths and opportunities for improvement. They also act as &amp;quot;ambassadors&amp;quot; for the Baldrige Program and performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application form for the 2011 Board of Examiners is now &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm"&gt;www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. Applications must be submitted electronically by 5 p.m. EST on January 13, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The board consists of more than 500 volunteers, including 12 judges and about 60 senior examiners representing many industries and sectors. Service on the board provides opportunities to enhance one&amp;#39;s knowledge about improving processes and achieving world-class results, develop a network of like-minded colleagues, and help improve U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the most valuable benefit to being an examiner: comprehensive training from one of the top 10 government leadership development programs as named by Leadership Excellence magazine for three years in a row. This professional development also can qualify for Continuing Education Units (CEUs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For assistance in preparing an examiner application, contact &lt;a href="mailto:examappl@nist.gov"&gt;examappl@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call the Examiner Hotline toll-free at 877-237-9064 (Option 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 and is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in cooperation with the private sector. The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance management strategies. The Baldrige Award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/RGhNo3bZbvk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Speech on Deming concepts and going 'beyond continuous improvement'</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	This presentation is from a 1994 event hosted by Clare Crawford-Mason and Lloyd Dobyns to capture the learning and legacy of Dr. W. Edwards Deming. Russ knew Dr. Deming and speaks here about the difference between &amp;quot;continuous improvement&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;discontinuous improvement&amp;quot; as seen through the lens of systems thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ASQ survey: Manufacturers optimistic about economic uptick in 2011</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The second annual ASQ Manufacturing Outlook Survey shows a vast majority of manufacturers are optimistic about an economic uptick in 2011 at their organizations. The survey conducted by the American Society for Quality &amp;ndash; the world&amp;rsquo;s largest network of quality resources and experts &amp;ndash; states 68 percent of respondents employed in the manufacturing sector predict their organizations will experience revenue growth. This is a bit of a brighter outlook than for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the economic landscape, a year ago, 64.7 percent of respondents predicted that revenue would grow in 2010. This year, when asked if their organization did experience revenue growth in 2010, 67 percent indicated &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; More than 1,200 manufacturing professionals from the United States and Canada responded to the online survey October 24 &amp;ndash; November 5, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two areas from the survey that showed the most promise were in the area of payroll and operational budgets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Only 18 percent expect a pay freeze in 2011 &amp;ndash; compared to 44.8 percent in 2010 at their organizations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		18 percent predict mandatory budget cuts in 2011 &amp;ndash; whereas 35.2 percent did in 2010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the other 2011 organizational options offered, respondents anticipate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Expectations of a salary/merit increase (48 percent)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations will continue to create processes to reduce costs (47 percent), down from 61.3 percent in 2010&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintaining current staff levels at their organizations (42 percent)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hiring of additional staff (42 percent)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No mandatory furlough days (73 percent); in 2010, 72 percent indicated they did not have to take furlough days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cutbacks and Quality &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As many organizations had to make sacrifices to survive a down economy, the survey inquired whether staff reductions or other cutbacks implemented in 2010 negatively impacted the quality of the products/services delivered. 33 percent of respondents believed that the quality of their products/services was negatively impacted. 32 percent believed that the quality did not suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manufacturers Offer Advice &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Respondents were also asked what one tip they would give to manufacturers to ensure revenue growth in 2011. The top four tips, similar to the 2010 outlook, from respondents were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continue to take part in continuous improvement practices, and increase use of quality processes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement more lean processes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce costs/eliminate waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Though it appears the manufacturing sector is still facing some challenges on the road to full economic recovery, the incremental gains shown in this survey are very promising,&amp;rdquo; said ASQ chair Peter Andres. &amp;ldquo;However, organizations still need to focus on and increase customer satisfaction, and implement continuous improvement practices to remain competitive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Lean results transparent for Safelite Glass plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/8d67446a-d527-40eb-8aed-b1c469c2d363_safelite1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safelite Glass Corporation, a leading producer of windshields for the automotive aftermarket, knew that to remain competitive with its Chinese counterparts, the company had to reduce costs. To do this, Safelite brought in experts from North Carolina State University&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Extension Service (IES) to meet its goals of reducing costs through improved efficiency and productivity within the company&amp;rsquo;s Enfield, N.C., plant. By implementing the principles of lean manufacturing, Safelite was able to retain sales to the tune of $2.6 million and save $670,000 in costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this reason the company was recognized on August 25 for its contribution to the &lt;a href="http://www.ies.ncsu.edu/1b4nc"&gt;1B4NC&lt;/a&gt; promise: to create $1 billion in economic benefit to the state of North Carolina from 2006 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bottlenecks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Downtime is not an option for the Halifax County facility, which produces approximately 700 different parts (20 simultaneously) and distributes them to 84 warehouses across the country. When any one of three furnaces shut down, bottlenecks occur, which can lead to a shutdown of the entire plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The goal of reducing bottlenecks prompted IES to facilitate a value stream map of the furnace department. A lean tool, value stream mapping (VSM) is a powerful technique for visualizing the flow of raw materials, information and finished products through all production steps for a particular product. For a VSM to be successful, it requires a group effort. In this case, it included members of the furnace department, Safelite leadership and IES facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/73f35180-62d9-4a12-844d-326bb9c89634_safelite2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The map indicated a need to reduce &amp;ldquo;no-loads&amp;rdquo;, as the company refers to them. No-loads, in the simplest of terms, are lost opportunities. Once a windshield is set, it is heated and then bent to specifications based on a vehicle make and model. This process follows an assembly line that passes through a high-temperature furnace. For every available slot that does not have a product, the company is wasting time, energy resources and, inevitably, money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The group developed a future state map, aimed to improve flow, layout and reduce inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Johnny McDonald, process engineer and 11-year veteran at Safelite, stated, &amp;ldquo;Lean changed the way we think around here. It used to be run, run, run. Now we run only what we need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Savings in work-in-process save investments in raw materials, space and labor, which all add to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results, clear as glass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another large component of Safelite&amp;rsquo;s lean work included the adoption of 5-S (sort, standardize, straighten, shine and sustain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quality manager Len Davis was amazed at the time that was saved by simply not having to dig for what you need. &amp;ldquo;Not having what you need when you need it is huge,&amp;rdquo; said Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lean work that was done in the furnace area decreased no-loads and increased production potential to an extra 57,000 units annually. Lean also decreased overtime in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/acbbfbb9-e972-4a2a-bba3-c5f4ff1e03dd_safelite3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once witnessing the power of lean in the furnace area, Safelite brought it in to the glass processing center with the goal of reducing changeover time, or the time it takes to switch a machine from making one product to another. On one particular line, there are seven changeovers per shift at an average of 15 minutes each. Lean helped reduce changeover time by one-third, allowing more parts to be produced in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But lean isn&amp;rsquo;t just about producing more. The principles also lead to improved quality. By standardizing work instructions, the glass processing center saw the level of poor edge quality improve, which decreases breakage, again saving the company raw material dollars and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speak the language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	IES is the extension department of the College of Engineering at North Carolina State University. IES provides technical expertise, training and education to help improve and sustain North Carolina industry. IES extension experts typically have more than 15 years of direct industry experience in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rich Glover, assistant vice president of manufacturing and distribution, said that working with IES lean specialist David Yates was more of a partnership than a typical client/vendor relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With all due respect, David&amp;rsquo;s not an academic; he understands production and the constraints of an organization,&amp;rdquo; said Glover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Glover likes the concept that lean requires input from the people on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Lean offered a baseline (for improvement), and it challenged our people to provide outcomes and solutions to their problems,&amp;rdquo; said Glover. &amp;ldquo;It also provided a common ground for engineers and plant employees to speak the same language while working toward a shared goal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/vN2DZ-84wag" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Driving lean across your organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/158c7887-cfd5-4c51-9c3f-5dc028ae738d_wroblewski.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the more unfortunate expressions, in my opinion, found in the lean community is &amp;ldquo;driving lean across the organization&amp;rdquo;. I hear and see this all the time. It can be found in lean books, articles, job postings, job descriptions, reviews, etc. &amp;ldquo;I want someone who can drive lean across the organization&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;To drive lean across the company, we need ...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What comes to your mind when you hear the expression &amp;ldquo;driving lean across the organization&amp;rdquo;? How would you drive lean across the organization?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Is this what we really need to do to move toward being a lean company? Can we sustain efforts if we drive them? What happens if the driver leaves the company? What about respect for people or engaging the employees?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a lean leader (both internal and external), I have been asked in the past to &amp;ldquo;drive&amp;rdquo; lean across the company. Having someone, especially an outside consultant, tasked with driving lean is not the best way to become lean. Sure, you most certainly will get some fast results, but it will not be sustained and it may cause more damage to the organization than the gains you achieved.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To begin changing our lean culture, instead of using the term &amp;ldquo;driving&amp;rdquo;, can we choose better words to reflect a better approach? How about leading the way, guiding, teaching or setting the example?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Now, how would you lead the way? How would you set the example of the lean approach within your organization? Would your course of action be different than if you drive lean?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Thoughts and considerations on 5-S implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	While&amp;nbsp;value stream mapping (VSM) and kaizen events are often the most&amp;nbsp;misused of the lean tools,&amp;nbsp;5-S is the most misunderstood&amp;nbsp;lean tool.&amp;nbsp;Here are some 5-S thoughts and considerations to review.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Common 5-S issues and mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The 5-S&amp;rsquo;s are about creating a safe, clean and organized work environment which eliminates waste including losses due to unsafe work conditions &amp;ndash; there is no sixth S for safety.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Successful lean implementations occur in organizations where the management team demonstrates leadership. This means&amp;nbsp;starting 5-S in the office first,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;at least implementing&amp;nbsp;it simultaneously in the office and factory.&amp;nbsp;There are organizations that say they have been doing lean for years yet have never applied it to the office. These organizations then wonder why they are showing &amp;ldquo;little or no progress&amp;rdquo; with their lean implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Demonstrating leadership also means managers and supervisors never &amp;ldquo;just walk by&amp;rdquo; an unsafe or dirty condition.&amp;nbsp;This leadership&amp;nbsp;helps develop a lean culture&amp;nbsp;where no one in the organization would knowingly walk&amp;nbsp;by an unsafe or dirty work condition. This lean culture is the foundation of world-class organizations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations&amp;nbsp;generally require their&amp;nbsp;factory associates to&amp;nbsp;clean&amp;nbsp;up their areas during or at the end of their shift. Yet, in the same organization, a third party is brought in or used to clean up the offices of the administrative associates.&amp;nbsp;If we want teamwork,&amp;nbsp;we need one set of rules.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The 5-S red tagging event is a &amp;ldquo;one-time&amp;rdquo; activity, not an annual activity that allows us to make excuses for what our area looks like during the year.&amp;nbsp;If our people are properly trained in 5-S, they will protect &amp;ldquo;their area&amp;rdquo; from things that do not belong there and move things to the &amp;ldquo;5-S parking lot&amp;rdquo; when they are no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The third S, sweep or shine, also means that we will develop ways to prevent things from getting dirty. It is&amp;nbsp;not just a matter of cleaning up every day. What can we do to prevent things from getting dirty so clean up is not required?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When 5-S fails, it fails because we did not properly implement the fourth S (schedule/standardize) and there was no follow-up&amp;nbsp;using the fifth S (sustain).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you want everyone to clean up, make sure everyone has his or her own cleaning supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, the&amp;nbsp;business will develop its own 5-S expertise&amp;nbsp;when new&amp;nbsp;5-S safety, organizing methods,&amp;nbsp;clean-up techniques&amp;nbsp;and other 5-S methods&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;established. Audit procedures and scoring should be adjusted to these developments, thus&amp;nbsp;raising the bar to the new baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One of the required measures for the success of your 5-S implementation includes never having to clean up in advance&amp;nbsp;of customer or other special company visitors.&amp;nbsp;Think about it: When we tell our associates they must&amp;nbsp;&amp;rdquo;clean up&amp;rdquo; in advance of a visitor, what are&amp;nbsp;we telling them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>What is a team charter? And, what is its purpose?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A team charter is a document that is developed in a group setting that clarifies team direction while establishing boundaries. It is developed early during the forming of the team. The charter should be developed in a group session to encourage understanding and buy-in.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The team charter has two purposes. First, it serves as a source for the team members to illustrate the focus and direction of the team. Second, it educates others (for example, the organizational leaders and other work groups), illustrating the direction of the team.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Investing the required time to develop a charter reduces confusion about the group&amp;rsquo;s objectives. The charter also provides the information needed to reduce the risk of rework, enabling the (action, kaizen or lean) team to get it right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Team Charter Sections:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Team purpose &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; This answers three questions: What is the value of drawing these people together? What problem are they facing? And, what would be an acceptable outcome?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Duration and time commitment&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The amount of time the team will be working together needs to be documented (for example, is this a six-month timeframe?). Depending on proposed solutions, the duration of implementing these recommendations may require time beyond the team&amp;rsquo;s meeting schedule. Another aspect to be considered is the estimated amount of time that will be dedicated weekly or monthly.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Scope (in scope / out of scope)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Thinking though the scope helps to define the beginning and end of the spectrum. It may list departments included or excluded. The scope, while setting parameters, also helps the team leader(s) easily identify tasks that are outside of the scope, minimizing scope creep.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Members&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Team leader and members should be listed individually. This provides recognition and enhances commitment. Alternate members also can be listed. The team sponsor from the leadership group needs to be assigned and listed after the team members.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Desired end result&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This provides an opportunity to begin with the end in mind. This is where the sponsor can establish goals for the team to achieve. The goals need to be clearly defined. By defining the desired end result, the magnitude of the change becomes evident.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Supporting resources&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The supporting resources almost always include other people that were not assigned as team members but still add value toward the overall purpose.&amp;nbsp;Other resources are dependent on the team activities (blueprints, meeting rooms, travel budgets, corporate authority, software, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reporting plan&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This defines how the team will communicate progress. The team usually has a higher authority that they answer to, and it is important to report how the team activities are going and what hurdles the team is facing. The reporting plan should establish the frequency of reporting as well as content.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Deliverables&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This section defines the outputs. It should include key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure the intended success. By considering the KPIs at this stage, immeasurable deliverables are eliminated early. The deliverables should include the documents, the desired behaviors and a long-term auditing process that verifies the deliverables are in place.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This section considers other departments or organizational initiatives that may have overlap with the group&amp;rsquo;s purpose. It could also include key resources that are known subject matter experts (SMEs) in specific fields.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The hypothetical example below shows that all of the elements can come together to create a highly useful document that boost the team&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game plan to turn good intentions into effective, lean practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If any company can implement the Six Sigma or lean management principles, why isn&amp;#39;t every company an IBM or Toyota? Clearly, there is much more to successful management practices than copying the example straight out of the text book. So, how can companies turn good intentions into effective practices? What, at board and ground level, can managers actually do?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lean and Six Sigma talent management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, the executive recruiting and search firm The Avery Point Group conducts a comprehensive study of the latest talent demand trends for lean&amp;nbsp;and Six Sigma. As an executive search firm, Avery Point has a unique vantage point from which to track trends taking place in industry. Trends in industry are often telegraphed into candidate requirements in job postings and can serve as a window into the latest corporate initiatives. For its annual study, the firm takes a significant look at Six Sigma and lean job postings found on the major job boards and review each job title and job content profile to gain a deeper understanding of the latest talent demand trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years of conducting the study, Avery Point has&amp;nbsp;seen a significant shift in the &amp;quot;center of gravity&amp;quot; as it relates to the prominence of Lean as the rising and now more dominate player in the corporate world of continuous improvement. This is a significant shift from the first study in 2005, where Six Sigma outpaced lean by more than 50 percent&amp;nbsp;as the more desired skill set. Avery Point fully expects this trend to continue in our future studies as more companies turn to lean as a hedge against growing economic and inflationary challenges.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the end, however, the real winner is any company that successfully engages in some form of continuous improvement, regardless of whether it is lean, Six Sigma, or some other well-executed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t think of any company that claims to be world class that is not utilizing some form of continuous improvement approach,&amp;quot; says Tim Noble, managing principal of The Avery Point Group. &amp;quot;World-class status is a constantly moving target defined by both your customers and your competitors. Without a continuous improvement approach you&amp;#39;re not even treading water in today&amp;#39;s highly competitive global economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Jack Welch discusses innovation in keynote speech</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, discusses innovation at symposium at Boston University&amp;#39;s School of Management. Welch says that although people often think innovation is limited to practical scientific advances, it&amp;#39;s much more than that. It&amp;#39;s about expansion. When you see something someone else has done, Welch says, you have to take it and bring it to new levels. To innovate something is as important as inventing it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>ASQ recognizes individuals with most certifications</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The American Society for Quality (ASQ), the world&amp;rsquo;s largest network of quality resources and experts, is proud to recognize the quality professionals who currently hold the most ASQ certifications. In total there are 11 individuals who currently hold 14 out of 18 ASQ certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Muralidhar Audipudy, Round Lake, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mahlon Cashman, Westfield, Mass.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sheldon Dummer, Grayslake, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Peter Ganavazos, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rajinder Kapur, Troy, Mich.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		John Lee, Sandy, Utah&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Yeo Leong, Singapore&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		William Meyer, O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Mo.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Francois Pageau, Le Gardeur, Quebec, Canada&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kevin Quigg, Carol Stream, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Michael Young, Neosho, Mo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1968, when the first ASQ certification exam was given, more than 170,000 individuals have taken the path to reaching their goal of becoming ASQ-certified in their field or profession. To learn more about ASQ&amp;rsquo;s certifications, visit &lt;a href="http://asq.org/certification/index.html"&gt;http://www.asq.org/certification/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	William Meyer, a quality specialist at The Boeing Company, is one ASQ member who has seen a distinct advantage to obtaining ASQ certifications. He is an ASQ Certified Biomedical Auditor, Calibration Technician, Six Sigma Green Belt, Quality Inspector, Quality Auditor, Quality Engineer, Quality Improvement Associate, Quality Process Analyst, Quality Technician, Reliability Engineer, Software Quality Engineer, Six Sigma Black Belt, HACCP Auditor, and Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Working to attain my ASQ certifications has put me on a path of success,&amp;quot; says Meyer. &amp;quot;Not only did I receive peer recognition, but recognition from my employer. My knowledge base has expanded and I feel more confident than ever of my skills in today&amp;rsquo;s employment landscape.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;ASQ provides certification as a way to provide formal recognition to professionals who have demonstrated an understanding of, and a commitment to, quality techniques and practices in their job and career,&amp;quot; explains Paul Borawski, ASQ executive director and chief strategic officer. &amp;quot;This is a great accomplishment and represents a high level of peer recognition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salary Survey Shows Certification Advantage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2009 &lt;a href="http://asq.org/media-room/press-releases/2009/20091201-salary-survey.html"&gt;Salary Survey&lt;/a&gt; shows 57.8 percent of respondents stating that they have at least one ASQ certification. While certifications and training allow quality professionals to gain new skills and proficiencies, evidence shows that these items can also greatly increase a quality professional&amp;rsquo;s earning potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Managers who are ASQ Certified Managers of Quality/Organizational Excellence reported they earn a higher average salary than their counterparts without this certification. In the United States, the difference is $9,551. In Canada, the difference is $7,742.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The top ASQ certifications held are ASQ Certified Quality Auditor (CQA) and ASQ Certified Quality Engineer (CQE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Respondents who completed one or more Six Sigma training programs report average earnings of $12,456 more than those who didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About ASQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ASQ is a global community of people dedicated to quality who share the ideas and tools that make our world work better.

            <title>Tougher competition demands smarter production methods</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The lead time from drawing board to finished product is getting ever shorter. And the consumer&amp;rsquo;s role in the product development process is becoming increasingly clear. Even large industrial corporations are pursuing a fast pace and are quick off the mark to bring customers into the loop in product development. When Swedish truck manufacturer Volvo Trucks decided to develop its new construction truck &amp;ndash; the Volvo FMX &amp;ndash; customer participation played a central role in the process.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The truck industry is one example in the industrial sector that is becoming increasingly customer-driven, at least according to Volvo Trucks. The life cycle of a truck model is admittedly still very long, about 10 to 20 years, but customer adaptations and individual variations are becoming increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We can see that a more segmented market is developing, in which fewer customers are satisfied with accepting a standard truck. Most of our customers influence the design so that the truck matches their individual requirements,&amp;rdquo; says Gunnar Eliasson who is market manager for the construction segment at Volvo Trucks in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Global competition is imposing tougher demands on companies&amp;rsquo; ability to deliver new products to the market. &amp;ldquo;The race is heating up,&amp;rdquo; says Jeffrey Liker, world-renowned professor at the University of Michigan in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Liker is a professor of industrial and operations engineering and among his publications is the best-selling book &amp;ldquo;The Toyota Way&amp;rdquo;. In the course of his research, he studied what makes the Japanese car manufacturer unique, and this in turn led him to an in-depth examination of the lean production method, where the focus is on deleting everything unnecessary from the development process and on cutting development lead time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Life cycles for all products are being cut as competition powers ongoing development. Nobody wants to risk losing market shares,&amp;rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the end-user enters the product development process, many traditionally technology-focused corporate cultures face major challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All companies say that they work close to their customers, but far from all do so because it&amp;rsquo;s difficult,&amp;rdquo; he points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This approach requires time together with customers; it requires a method for identifying customer requirements and then transforming them into technical specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Volvo Trucks developed its most recent model, the Volvo FMX &amp;ndash; a truck designed for the building and construction sector &amp;ndash; a new approach was adopted in the product development process. Development would take place together with customers, drivers, sales staff, and marketing specialists &amp;ndash; and in a way that had never previously been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We wanted to ask two questions: what was good about the existing model that we offered construction customers, and what changes would they like to see,&amp;rdquo; relates Gunnar Eliasson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eliasson and a number of his colleagues embarked on a tour of Europe with the aim of drawing up a wish-list for the forthcoming model. That list was long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After this Europe-wide dialogue was summarized, it was time to arrange priorities. At the top of the to-do list was a new cab exterior, better-tailored rear-view mirrors, sturdier and more service-friendly bumpers, better-positioned air intakes for the engine, and more service-friendly headlamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The task of converting the wish-list into prototypes and full-scale models went to product developers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to just do what it says on the list. We must go one step further and surprise our customers, add that little bit extra. Our team was a mixed bunch of people from marketing and product development who together had the ability to spice things up,&amp;rdquo; recalls Eliasson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And that is exactly what marks the biggest difference between lean and traditional product development, according to Liker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In lean production, specialists work together freely across several departments and areas, all so as to be able to better meet customer demands. At the same time, this approach promotes constant learning about the production processes and understanding of how product development is conducted. Traditional product development, on the other hand, takes place in separate cells where each development group does its utmost within its own specific area &amp;ndash; but with very little exchange of experience between the various departments,&amp;rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under immense secrecy and after signing a strict confidentiality agreement, a number of customers were then brought together in various customer clinics to evaluate the new construction truck. A model of the truck was displayed in a studio and on the wall there were pictures of the new truck in various working environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The new, more powerful appearance was highly appreciated when we showed the truck in our customer clinics. The participants recognized the Volvo design just as we had hoped,&amp;rdquo; says Eliasson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another studio there was a cab with all the new equipment fitted. The customers could look, feel and try out the equipment and offer their feedback: for instance, how about the new ladder &amp;ndash; was it correctly positioned so the driver could easily get out of the cab and conveniently check the load platform without having to engage in acrobatics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eliasson feels that the project was very successful, with short lead times, and thanks to the fact that both drivers and customers entered the project early on in the process the development engineers were better able to spend their time on what mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The benefits of inviting customers into the product development process far outweigh the risk that information might spread to our competitors,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/XbXASPCkJUQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Nordson names vice president of global continuous improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nordson Corporation on October 28 announced the appointment of James E. DeVries to the newly created enterprise-level position of vice president of global continuous improvement. Reporting directly to Nordson president and CEO Michael F. Hilton, DeVries will be tasked with driving profitable growth in all operating segments through elevation of Nordson&amp;rsquo;s ongoing continuous improvement and margin enhancement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are committed to building on excellence and extending our competitive advantages everywhere we operate,&amp;rdquo; said Hilton. &amp;ldquo;While Nordson&amp;rsquo;s current performance is at a very strong level, we believe there are multiple opportunities for us to deliver even better performance. The creation of this new position provides the additional organizational focus necessary to capitalize on these opportunities. Jim DeVries is an ideal choice for this new challenge and among Nordson&amp;rsquo;s most proven senior leaders. As vice president of operations for Nordson&amp;rsquo;s largest operating segment, Adhesive Dispensing Systems, Jim has demonstrated the ability to drive improved performance across multiple geographies and end markets over a sustained period. His ongoing efforts in his new position will take Nordson beyond Lean to the next level of performance, enable us to serve our customers more effectively and ultimately deliver greater benefits to our shareholders over the long term.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>ASQ Lean and Six Sigma Conference focuses on customer satisfaction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations know the key to survival is maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, because keeping customers is much easier than earning new ones. Those organizations also know that using lean and Six Sigma helps them to stay fiscally competitive. But now the task is combining financial stability and increased customer satisfaction. The quality community will have an opportunity to learn just that at ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2011 &lt;a href="http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lean and Six Sigma Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2011 Lean and Six Sigma Conference will be held February 28 to March 1 in Phoenix, Ariz., at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. Session topics include: Six Sigma for Crisis Management; Attack and Relieve Your Healthcare Pain; White Collar Lean: Kaizen Events for the Office; How to Provide Value More Quickly to Your Customers; Gauging Readiness for Lean; and Growing Six Sigma Without Sacrificing Requirements. The full program and session descriptions can be found at &lt;a href="http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Recommendations and suggestions for 5-S auditing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The fifth&amp;nbsp;component of 5-S, Sustain,&amp;nbsp;is all about developing the discipline to use and maintain&amp;nbsp;the 5-S system on a daily basis everywhere within the organization.&amp;nbsp;Sustain means understanding how 5-S eliminates organizational waste and then making the&amp;nbsp;first four S&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;a habit and part of the company&amp;rsquo;s culture.&amp;nbsp;Sustain, for most organizations (even after the&amp;nbsp;5-S training&amp;nbsp;and 5-S kaizen events),&amp;nbsp;means 5-S audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are some recommendations and suggestions on 5-S&amp;nbsp;auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Audit scores range from 0.0 to 5.0. We&amp;nbsp;use scores in tenths.&amp;nbsp;More on this below.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		First, understand that audits,&amp;nbsp;like third-party inspection, are wasteful activities.&amp;nbsp;Like product or service quality, 5-S is an activity that we and the customer expect to pay one person to do it right the first time.&amp;nbsp;Audits do serve the short-term purpose&amp;nbsp;of both the reinforcement of the new process we are implementing (necessary if your organizations have had many&amp;nbsp;&amp;rdquo;programs of the month&amp;rdquo;) and&amp;nbsp;advanced 5-S training activities (How do&amp;nbsp;we achieve a score of a &amp;ldquo;5.0&amp;rdquo; on an audit of our work area?).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The audit team&amp;nbsp;should consist of both factory and office associates, an hourly and salary mix.&amp;nbsp;General guidelines are four to six auditors (not including the lean facilitator,&amp;nbsp;per 250-person organization). The audit team should do practice audits&amp;nbsp;to get everyone on the same page and develop a baseline.&amp;nbsp;Also, consider how government&amp;nbsp;regulations&amp;nbsp;can set baseline scores. For example, if your organization produces food or medical&amp;nbsp;products, meeting&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;FDA&amp;nbsp;workplace requirements might mean that the minimum 5-S&amp;nbsp;score for the first four S&amp;rsquo;s is a 3.0. Scores less than 3.0 might mean the FDA requirements are not being met.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, audits should occur&amp;nbsp;at least every two weeks.&amp;nbsp;Remember, it is both process reinforcement and a learning experience. As the average audit score climbs,&amp;nbsp;the audit time span can be increased. The organization should determine what the operational criteria&amp;nbsp;will be for eliminating audits.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5-S job instructions (the fourth S) and audit areas should be established by natural work groups and teams in both manufacturing and the office.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is suggested that 5-S office guidelines be developed for each organization. Office areas, unlike manufacturing areas, can be categorized into basically one group.&amp;nbsp;The organization should create common 5-S job instructions (part of the fourth S)&amp;nbsp;that define the organization&amp;rsquo;s office 5-S expectations. Some examples are shown below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/10/15/quick/ab0cb066-7ab7-4f7a-9c23-a0904ae413e3_rubrich400.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 341px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S scoring guideline sheet is shown below for the first three S&amp;rsquo;s (Electronic copies of all 5-S guidelines, scoring, and grading charts are available upon request at &lt;a href="mailto:kelly@wcmfg.com" target="_blank"&gt;kelly@wcmfg.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich401.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It should be noted that there are special 5-S audit circumstances for safety violations.&amp;nbsp;First,&amp;nbsp;the &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;that the&amp;nbsp;safety violation is covered by gets a score of &amp;ldquo;zero.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;Typically, these are second S violations.&amp;nbsp;The audit team&amp;nbsp;must immediately notify&amp;nbsp;the responsible supervisor and the&amp;nbsp;safety violation must be corrected immediately.&amp;nbsp;The audit must confirm the correction (the score does not change after correction).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A typical 5-S grading sheet is shown below. Note that as important as the&amp;nbsp;score is,&amp;nbsp;comments on what needs to improved upon to achieve a score of 5.0 also&amp;nbsp;must be included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rubrich402.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In the beginning, we believe audit scores should be posted (high to low) in a very visible area of the organization so everyone can see how the organization is doing. The high scores and&amp;nbsp;the 5-S activities, in general, should&amp;nbsp;be one topic in the organization&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;monthly&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;all hands&amp;rdquo; meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Over time, the&amp;nbsp;business will develop its own 5-S expertise&amp;nbsp;when new&amp;nbsp;5-S safety, organizing methods,&amp;nbsp;clean-up techniques&amp;nbsp;and other 5-S methods&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;established. Audit procedures and scoring should be adjusted to these developments, thus&amp;nbsp;raising the bar to the new baseline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the required measures for the success of your audits and 5-S implementation&amp;nbsp;in general&amp;nbsp;includes never having to clean up in advance&amp;nbsp;of customer or other special company visitors. Always being&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;tour&amp;rdquo; or&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;visit&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;ready is an important 5-S measure.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Total Productive Maintenance in action</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	While recently teaching about Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) using the learn-by-doing approach, we were presented with a great learning opportunity. Our first task was to get our hands dirty in giving the selected machine a deep and thorough cleaning. This cleaning is not just to make the machine look good; we were inspecting the machine while cleaning. This deep cleaning process paid particular attention to those hard-to-reach spots not normally seen by the machine operator on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We did find many issues with this machine that required repair during this deep clean. This also was accompanied with many comments like &amp;ldquo;I never knew that before&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how much dirt and chips were under here&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;No wonder it leaks, all the drain holes are plugged up.&amp;rdquo; There were several other comments made that would make a sailor blush, and I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it to your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the middle of our partial disassembly of the machine to reach those places where the sun doesn&amp;rsquo;t shine, we found one major problem, a significant rip in the protective sheath of the main control wiring under the machine against the chip conveyor system. It would have never been seen walking around the machine under normal inspection.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With the wires unprotected and naked to the world, we have the potential of a major breakdown. Not only would a failure involving these wires cause a very expensive repair bill with significant downtime, but we have the serious potential of electrocuting someone.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Preventing the loss of life is the highest priority over any of the six big losses found in the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) metric.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	After doing some root cause analysis, the team concluded that the original poor design of the machine (thinner sheath material, plastic elbow joints and poor routing location under the machine) was the main root cause. After the new and improved material arrived the next day (thicker sheath and cast metal elbows), the team replaced the wire covering and re-routed the wiring to the back of the machine (instead of under the machine), making it free and clear of the chip conveyor system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Our TPM approach included corrective and preventive actions by improving the machine design. The end result is a more reliable, more efficient, safer machine available for making parts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Continuous improvement approach reduces errors in records</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Routine floor audits and data-gathering protocols uncovered some surprises at MEDRAD: Up to 20 percent of all in-process device history record (DHR) packets contained an error. This rate was particularly troubling because MEDRAD employees were double- and even triple-checking the required paperwork for the medical devices manufactured by the company to ensure accuracy prior to submission to the product release coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company, located in Pittsburgh, is a global leader in developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing diagnostic imaging and therapeutic medical devices used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular and other diseases. A 2003 winner of the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, MEDRAD employs more than 2,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recognition of Errors Leads to Team Improvement Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operating in a government-regulated environment, MEDRAD places great importance on product and operational quality as well as on specific paper trail requirements such as DHRs. Created for each medical product assembled, DHRs contain records of the manufacture date, assemblers responsible for manufacturing, test results and more. DHRs are also known as traveler packages, according to Matt Boyle, plant quality manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The traveler package is simply the paper documentation that travels with the unit during assembly,&amp;rdquo; says Boyle, an American Society for Quality senior member and the chair-elect for ASQ&amp;rsquo;s Pittsburgh Section. &amp;ldquo;The manufacturing steps are recorded, signed and dated. This becomes our objective evidence that the unit was built to specification,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2004, routine floor audits uncovered that up to 20 percent of all in-process DHR packets contained an error. Additionally, data collected during a subsequent protocol confirmed that processes for assuring DHR quality prior to product release were ineffective and causing unnecessary rework and delays during the product release process. The data captured the attention of company leaders in the compliance and manufacturing areas and led to a continuous improvement project to reduce the error rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aligning Project Goals to Corporate Goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	At MEDRAD, the impact of all continuous improvement projects is assessed against five corporate objectives as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Exceed financials.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Grow the company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve quality and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve customer satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve employee satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DHR error reduction project supported all five corporate objectives in varying degrees, with the highest priority devoted to improving quality and productivity. The team was tasked with making significant improvement in the quality of DHRs by reducing error rates prior to product release review from 20 percent to 5 percent while developing processes that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t negatively affect efficiency or interfere with growth capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securing Buy-In&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement team identified key stakeholders for the project by focusing on areas of the business that would experience the most impact, such as regulatory and corporate compliance, quality and operations. Representatives from these areas were invited to provide oversight, sponsorship and input at the corporate, plant and department levels. Maintaining cross-functional representation on the improvement team was key for all stakeholders, as was the opportunity to approve changes to procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applying Continuous Improvement Methodology to Reduce Errors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement team, which finished fourth in ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2008 Team Excellence Award process, followed MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s IMAGES Lean Six Sigma continuous improvement methodology. The acronym represents the key stages in the company&amp;rsquo;s quality improvement process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;dentify the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;easure the current state.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalyze the root causes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;enerate potential solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xperiment and then &lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;xecute proven solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ustain improvements over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When identifying possible root causes for the high error rates, the team used the following analysis tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cause-and-effect diagramming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brainstorming with cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pareto analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A cause-and-effect (or fishbone) diagram was useful for developing strategy on moving from a high rate of errors to no errors. This tool helped team members brainstorm about possible root causes associated with the reported defect types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improvement team also created a redundancy/gap matrix by asking: What procedural checks are in place upstream to prevent errors for each inspection step in the final quality control inspection procedure? The result of this activity was a table that made redundancies and gaps easy to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the matrix and the cause-and-effect diagrams, the team identified the following final root causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inconsistency: more checks for some product lines than for others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Redundancy: confusion as to who was responsible for what activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Compliance: some personnel not following checks as required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scattered data: error data stored in multiple databases, as well as manual tracking and reporting of errors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of technology: manual input of data throughout the process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Poor process: no standard DHR format across assembly cells, as well as overly complex documentation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of focus: no visible metrics or team objectives of performance feedback related to DHR accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team proceeded to validate these root causes on the company&amp;rsquo;s Stellant line, the highest volume injector product. The protocol was piloted for four months, which allowed the improvement team sufficient time to identify a correlation between the overall defects throughout all product lines and those found on the Stellant line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing a Three-Tiered Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The team&amp;rsquo;s two-year plan focused on three areas for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technology: to eliminate human error&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Process: to standardize and simplify DHR travelers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People: to implement systems to enable, measure and reward performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expected error reduction for each of the three solution types was analyzed to help prioritize implementation. For example, while the cost of technology-related solutions was high, this category also had a high probability of success &amp;ndash; a projected 29-percent error reduction rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Using brainstorming techniques, project timelines and cost analysis, the team selected three technology solutions for implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Automated electrical safety test cart: A fully mobile system would enhance the efficiency and accuracy of device history by collecting and printing test results, eliminating manual recording of test data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Crystal reports: These reports include all current revisions used on all production modules, eliminating the need to write the revisions on the assembly traveler.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electronic warranty: With this solution, an equipment record is created for every unit and stored in MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s business enterprise software. When the unit is prepared for shipping, the e-warranty is printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The three technology solutions were validated by protocols to ensure the documented testing, qualification, verification and/or validation requirements were met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Certain types of DHR errors, such as missed checkboxes, incomplete DHR travelers and missing serial numbers or labels, were best resolved using process improvements. The team&amp;rsquo;s improvement solutions included launching new device review travelers, creating and placing labels with visual work instructions (VWIs), incorporating the slash mark to cross out non-applicable areas, and improving DHR travelers by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminating revision spaces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removing redundant data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coordinating with barcode serial number team to scan serial numbers (eliminated recording serial numbers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People-Related Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once the technology and process solutions were in place, the team turned its attention to errors related to the accountability of the production associates responsible for completing the DHRs. These types of errors involved record-keeping as well as missing signatures, data and paperwork. The four solutions selected were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incorporate DHR accuracy as a key production team objective&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase employee incentive time related to DHR quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement targeted, independent reviews within the assembly process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement real-time error notification and performance tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD used two methods to motivate production team members to improve their quality performance related to DHRs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A significant portion of a production associate&amp;rsquo;s annual performance rating and salary increase was linked to DHR error performance. Aggressive objectives were included in each associate&amp;rsquo;s annual plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The company tied extra paid time off to achieving team objectives. During this project, more than one-third of the production team&amp;rsquo;s incentive time was based on DHR quality. In concert with these methods, MEDRAD also provided timely feedback to production associates through daily performance tracking for each production cell and the overall production team. Secondly, the company developed a process to ensure that supervisors receive notification of errors and review them with the responsible associates on the same day the error occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Error Rates Drop as Project Benefits Soar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Within just six months of implementing the people-focused solutions, the error rate fell below 5 percent and the project team achieved its goal. Performance improvement continued throughout 2007, and the error rate stood at a mere 2.2 percent for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tangible benefits of the improvement project were significant as MEDRAD saved $40,000 while reducing its overall DHR error rate to less than 5 percent. In addition, the project was also credited with several intangible benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greater focus on DHR quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased employee satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved communication among peers as well as between employees and supervisors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Employees becoming &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; of change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased focus on communication regarding errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the team learned a great deal about process improvement throughout the project, one of the key lessons focused on documentation. Boyle explains, &amp;ldquo;We had to educate people about the importance of documentation quality. The mind-set and focus of our assemblers tended to be on product quality and not on how accurately they completed the documentation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supporting Corporate Goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As noted earlier, all continuous improvement projects at MEDRAD are assessed against five corporate goals. The impact of this project dovetailed nicely with corporate goals as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Exceed financials: Reduced cost of poor quality ($45,000 annually).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Grow the company: Smoother ramp-up of new products.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve quality and productivity: Higher throughput with fewer resources reduced quality control manpower.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve customer satisfaction: Fewer delays of product to finished goods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve employee satisfaction: Streamlined, less tedious processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s Ongoing Commitment to Continuous Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To support the implemented solutions, 70 quality system documents were revised, which required training to implement and sustain. While no quality system procedures were revised for the people-related solutions, the results have been sustained through the objective-setting process and by lowering the error rate objective in pursuing continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company introduced a DHR database, which provides the measurement system necessary to monitor performance. Both trend and Pareto data are reviewed during monthly quality council meetings and quarterly management review sessions. Goals are revised annually based on continuous improvement. In addition to trend and Pareto chart data, statistical process control is used to evaluate the performance of the process and to detect when changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Baldrige program name change emphasizes performance excellence</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After 23 years as the &amp;quot;Baldrige National Quality Program,&amp;quot; the nation&amp;#39;s public-private partnership dedicated to performance excellence has decided to highlight that mission with a new name &amp;ndash; the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program. Concurrently, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award will now be called the Malcolm Baldrige Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Performance excellence&amp;quot; describes a focus on overall organizational quality, and for years, followers of the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence have indicated that this term best reflects what makes Baldrige work. This opinion was confirmed by a study in 2007 that recommended changing the names of the Baldrige Program and Award. The recent realignment of the Baldrige Program&amp;#39;s parent agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), provided a logical time to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Baldrige program director Harry Hertz said, &amp;quot;We are pleased to now make performance excellence a central part of our name. In the more than two decades since the inception of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the field of quality has evolved from a focus on product, service and customer quality to a broader, strategic focus on overall organizational quality &amp;ndash; which we have called performance excellence. In line with this concept of overall organizational excellence, which some people refer to as &amp;quot;biq Q&amp;quot; quality, the Baldrige Criteria have evolved to stay on the leading edge of validated management practice and needs, so it is fitting that our new name emphasizes the concept of excellence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Developing a lean culture â an elements checklist</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is organizational culture?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is a set of rules and standards shared by members of an organization, which &amp;ndash; when acted upon by the members &amp;ndash; produce behavior that falls within a range that the organization considers proper and acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is a learned process and is developed by the organization as a response to the working environment established by the organization&amp;rsquo;s leadership and management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A culture is established in all organizations, regardless of whether its development is guided or unguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture can have a positive or negative impact on the organization&amp;rsquo;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Culture helps us survive in the environment in which we live and work. Survival is a very strong word. Without culture, everyone in an organization would act or behave differently. No one would be able to anticipate someone else&amp;rsquo;s behavior, and no one would understand why people behave the way they do. The organization&amp;rsquo;s performance would be very chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why would culture change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Culture is a learned process that aids us in surviving in the environment in which we live and work. If the environment changes, then the culture would have to change in order to increase the chances for the organization to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Notice that we say &amp;ldquo;increase&amp;rdquo; our chances of surviving. There are no guarantees in life. The more flexible and adaptable a culture is to an ever-changing environment, the more chance it has in adapting or responding to environmental pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lean culture enables lean implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lean culture is one of the&amp;nbsp;four components of a successful lean implementation. Shown on the picture below, the components are: Lean Planning, Lean Concepts, Lean Tools and Lean Culture. Policy Deployment, which connects an organization&amp;rsquo;s goals to&amp;nbsp;the Lean Tools,&amp;nbsp;is part of the Lean Planning activity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/932bd523-b26c-4666-8f61-d9fbfec8d989_rubrich301.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 365px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to note that this order of component implementation may seem incorrect to current lean practitioners. This results from our tendency to jump to the lean tools first.&amp;nbsp;However, the road map to using lean as a system and becoming world class starts with the end in mind &amp;ndash; Lean Planning. Lean Planning ensures that we are not using lean as an add-on or appendage in our organization, but as&amp;nbsp;the system to accomplish the organization&amp;rsquo;s goals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	All four of these components must be implemented to their fullest extent throughout the organization, in a timely manner, to be successful. Most organizations like to pick and choose what elements of lean they would like to implement. This is primarily because they do not understand that lean is a total system and represents a complete and comprehensive culture change in their organization. Lean represents a completely new way of managing the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How do you establish a lean culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A Lean culture is established in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Part 1 &amp;ndash; Developing a cultural framework or structure (this can be done quickly)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Part 2 - Establishing a &amp;ldquo;people and team-based&amp;rdquo; environment and filling in the framework (this generally takes years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Part 1 &amp;ndash; Developing a cultural framework&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A lean cultural framework is developed and sets the boundaries for a positive culture by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establishing &amp;ldquo;guiding principles&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;behavioral expectations&amp;rdquo; for the entire organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Linking human resources policies and procedures to the behavioral expectations and the lean vision and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establishing organizational leadership and management principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As noted, the leadership team can jump-start the culture change process by issuing organizational behavioral expectations. Behavioral expectations, or codes of conduct, are short statements, usually in the form of a laminated pocket card, that are &amp;ldquo;a set of rules or standards&amp;rdquo; that members of the organization use to guide their behavior and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Behavioral expectations will only produce culture change if they are modeled by the leadership team. Since the culture change process can take years, the leadership team must be committed to the guidelines as a new way of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An excellent example of behavioral expectations&amp;nbsp;is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/254ebde2-3a25-47b2-bae7-9a7f2aaf6f18_rubrich302.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 370px" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the behavioral expectations established, the&amp;nbsp;next step in Part 1 is to connect these expectations and our lean implementation plan to our HR&amp;nbsp;policies. We must revise our HR policies and people measures in the areas of to align with the new Lean culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job descriptions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Performance evaluations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Promotions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reward systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bonus systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recruiting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New associate orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 3 of Part 1&amp;nbsp;is a crucial step and is all about organizational leadership principles.&amp;nbsp;How do we begin implementing culture change in our company? All successful and sustainable business change starts with top management (leadership team).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new lean culture will not develop unless the organization&amp;rsquo;s leadership team is willing to model and be the examples of the new behaviors. As noted author Tom Peters states it, &amp;ldquo;your people will watch your feet, not your lips.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This leadership starts with culture but extends throughout the lean implementation. For example, when we start doing 5-S activities in our organization,&amp;nbsp;are we starting in the office with the leadership team offices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/c5c8591b-aaa7-4e92-abcb-493cdf82c0ba_rubrich303.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 372px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DuPont expression applies to all aspects of lean. You can remove safety and add quality, 5-S, productivity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The pictures below are not examples&amp;nbsp;of leadership at the management/supervisory level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;

            <title>N. Carolina rug manufacturer weaves continuous innovation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Capel Rugs Inc., a company built on innovation, understands the need for a quality, consistent product. The company enlisted the help of North Carolina State University&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Extension Service (IES) to improve efficiency and their competitive edge. The results are more than $2 million in economic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Capels are part of the fabric that is Troy, N.C. The Capels didn&amp;rsquo;t start out in the rug business, but the business of agriculture. A. Leon Capel Sr., owner of Gee-Haw Plowline Company back in 1917, produced plow lines used to steer horses or mules in the fields. But soon after the invention of the Model T, which revolutionized transportation including the introduction of the tractor, the need for plow lines became almost obsolete. Capel needed a new use for his materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/2d7bfa79-c15c-4537-b088-bd09008417a2_ncsu001.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 261px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He fashioned those raw materials into a continuous yarn, braided them and manufactured the world&amp;rsquo;s first continuous yarn braided rug. Ninety-two years and three generations later, Capel Rugs remains one of the largest manufacturers and importers of area rugs in the country. The second generation of A. Leon Capel Jr., Jesse S. Capel and Arron W.E. Capel used their own unique expertise to build a multi-million-dollar company with international acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Handing over the reigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/df64c7c5-4501-46a4-be01-18b5edd385d0_ncsu002.jpeg" style="width: 150px; height: 223px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Richard Capel stands in front of a building that has beared his family&amp;#39;s name since 1917.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Richard Capel, director of manufacturing and third generation, credits his grandfather, father and uncles for the innovations they bestowed to the company. Richard&amp;rsquo;s father, Arron, led the initiative for retail stores, of which Capel Rugs now claims 11. And Richard&amp;rsquo;s uncle, Jesse, designed the air tables used to spin the rug as it is sewn, reducing the need for manual handling. This, as well as other innovations, helped this company to prosper through the Great Depression and other economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As far as Richard&amp;rsquo;s contribution &amp;ndash; it just may be the incorporation of lean. The &amp;ldquo;a-ha&amp;rdquo; moment for Richard occurred after attending an event sponsored by IES describing principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS). TPS organizes the manufacturing and logistics processes while stressing the importance of quality interactions between suppliers and customers. Understanding and incorporating TPS is key to building a lean organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Change begets results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Richard brought home the principles of lean and began to implement them throughout the manufacturing operation. He trained the manufacturing department supervisors to recognize inefficiency and waste and to bring solutions to the table. He initiated a pull system where output is factored on customer demand vs. operational capacity. He also improved the inventory system with a kanban or triggering system that initiates a reorder or refill of supplies, ensuring availability of parts while simultaneously reducing inventory. Shipping performance improved and customers were able to take advantage of the Zip Ship program, allowing one-day turnaround on some orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less inventory lessens the need for warehouse space and, subsequently, rent and utilities. For these and additional waste-reduction measures, the company saved $890,000 annually. Cost savings and increased and retained sales were part of the more than $2 million in economic benefit the company reported at the completion of the projects with IES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pliability of lean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Processes in the creation of their products had been streamlined due to the incorporation of lean, so a logical approach included applying those same principles into the corporate office of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Lean works anywhere,&amp;rdquo; said Capel. &amp;ldquo;It works in the hospital, the office, the plant.&amp;rdquo; With leadership support, Amy Roberts, purchasing manager, brought the expertise of IES on-site to regulate raw material and supply inventories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After receiving a training grant from the Workforce Incumbent Act grant from the Pee Dee Workforce Development Board, Lean Office was applied to the corporate office in Troy. One process addressed was the set-up of new customer accounts so they could start ordering rugs right away. Formerly, the process of receiving the initial request, to granting the credit and database set-up, could take weeks to facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steve Laton, lean extension specialist, conducted a value stream mapping (VSM) exercise, which is a lean tool that demonstrates visually the flow of raw materials, information and finished products or services through all production steps from receiving to shipping. Applying the VSM to the credit process, Laton helped identify the current state, which brings to light all of the inefficiencies and bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Once you visualize the problem areas, only then can you begin to resolve them,&amp;rdquo; said Laton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He and the Capel team mapped the future state, or the ideal flow, which removed 90 percent of non-value-added work from the process. They now typically grant credit and finalize the process within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This substantial reduction allows the order to be placed much quicker, the product to be manufactured and delivered to the customer quicker, and ultimately billed and paid for in a more timely fashion &amp;ndash; all adding to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though this lean event was an office initiative, it runs parallel to Richard&amp;rsquo;s vision of further lead time reductions &amp;ndash; continually improving and building a true customer-focused organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At Capel, innovation lives on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Capel Rugs Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Capel Rugs Inc. is based in Troy, N.C., where the company still does the spinning, dyeing, weaving, braiding and sewing for Capel&amp;rsquo;s American Original braided rugs. &lt;span class="style1"&gt;From original braided rugs and the finest hand-knotted rugs to innovative indoor-outdoor and youth-friendly collections, Capel offers more rugs in more categories than any other rug company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/lean_manufacturing/~4/8kTNiWe2Xio" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why you need to create a standard process for spare parts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What do you see in this picture? Besides a lack of any real 5-S, what thoughts come to your kaizen mind about the motors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/f8ebd521-560e-4e93-83a5-ce63d2f59200_wroblewski001.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 226px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps you may think about what are the motors used for? Do we really need them? Are they critical? How fast can we get one if we needed it? What is our process to decide what parts to keep in stock? Or, how much do they cost?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the elements of a solid Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) program that does not get much attention is our spare parts. Simply taking good care of our machines and equipment does not entirely eliminate the chance of them breaking down. When that happens, the fire drill begins.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Go to any maintenance department in any company in the country and you find many things in common, like a storage area for supplies and parts. Since this is typically viewed as a non-production area, we tend to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With a kaizen approach, we need to improve all areas of our company, including spare parts. With a good TPM program, we should develop standard processes that establish the method to determine what parts to keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	First, a team-based approach is best used to identify the critical parts that we may need. We can use the recommended spare parts list by the manufacturer, but only as a starting point. Many times, this list of parts can include more parts than we should keep. Look at the machine history but also take care not to include a part just because we got burned back in 1982 when it broke down for six months.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a guideline, critical parts can be identified as &amp;ldquo;recent chronic problem areas&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;difficult to obtain within 24 to 48 hours&amp;rdquo;. Cost should NOT be a factor. If the chance of a problem is high and we are left waiting days or weeks for the parts to come in, it&amp;rsquo;s better to keep these parts on hand no matter what the cost of the part is. Compare it to lost business, customer disappointments, etc., to factor in the decision. Discuss this with your team and company management to determine what makes the best sense in your situation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Once we have a plan, set up a spare parts list for each piece of equipment and clearly identify the parts in the stock area.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As all things in lean, this is not a static process; it&amp;rsquo;s dynamic. The spare parts list needs to be reviewed on a regular basis &amp;ndash; perhaps once a year. Machines fall out of warranty or the manufacturer no longer supports this model in either service or parts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Without a standard process for our spare parts, we may find parts on the shelves like those in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>TPM and operator asset ownership: This is my equipment!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) combines the traditionally American practice of preventive maintenance with total quality control and total employee involvement to create a culture where operators develop ownership of their equipment, and become full partners with maintenance, engineering and management to assure that equipment operates properly every day. As part of modern TPM applications, the asset owner/operator performs much, and sometimes all, of the routine autonomous maintenance (AM) tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Autonomous maintenance ideally ensures appropriate and effective efforts are expended since the machine is wholly the domain of one person or team. TPM is a critical adjunct to lean manufacturing. If machine uptime is not predictable and if process capabilities are not sustained, the processes become unstable and production flows will be interrupted. One way to think of TPM is &amp;ldquo;asset deterioration prevention&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;maintenance prevention&amp;rdquo;, not fixing/repairing machines in a constant reactive environment. For this reason, TPM is also referred to as &amp;ldquo;Total Productive Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Total Process Management&amp;rdquo;. TPM is a proactive approach that essentially aims to prevent any kind of losses before occurrence. Its motto is &amp;ldquo;zero error, zero work-related accident and zero loss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reacting to breakdowns and dealing with production losses is unfortunately still a daily routine for most asset-intensive manufacturing organizations. Competition continues to raise the bar, thus increasing pressure on the &amp;ldquo;cost of goods sold&amp;rdquo; (COGS) and the opportunity costs of lost production. With the globalization of manufacturing of most products, organizations must compete with low-cost producers and are forced to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What action to take? If it were as easy as hiring a smart leader for manufacturing, every plant would have the shiny wall plaque that illustrates their brilliance for excellent performance. Operational Excellence (OpEx) is based on a holistic asset design, asset care and asset management concept powered by Reliability Excellence (Rx). It requires total collaborative, fully integrated effort by all functional departments at a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Driving an organization toward OpEx is a realistic goal when there is solid Rx program and project management coupled with proven TPM strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From experience, Life Cycle Engineering knows that if the fundamentals of asset reliability are not in place, it is difficult to sustain TPM. Even with significant activities and training, sustainability is a challenge. LCE assures that all Rx elements are in place to support the TPM culture to grow in a responsible manner with the target of achieving Operational Excellence. The goal of this article is to show that a basic asset-centric care program can be an effective foundation for a fully functioning preventive and predictive maintenance and operator care program. Operator care correctly applied can make a profound contribution to any organization implementing a Six Sigma, continuous improvement or similar quality strategy. Most importantly, basic operator care can have a significant positive effect on asset availability coupled with reductions in operations and maintenance expenditures through the achievement of increased asset reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we will concentrate on some conceptual issues to operator care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Origins of operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care and Six Sigma, CI, other improvement methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care as part of the overall asset reliability strategy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Benefits of TPM/AM operator care programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Operator Care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care is a commitment by plant management, operations and maintenance to ensure that assets maintain their expected level of quality and volume for output, while reaching their expected life span within the plant. Operator care attempts to greatly reduce or eliminate reactive maintenance and is driven by operations/production. In operator care environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plant condition is optimum (TPM and 5-S are applied)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators are engaged in asset care
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Tighten, lubricate, clean, (detect, inspect, correct)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Can be autonomous maintenance (AM) (operator-performed maintenance)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standard operating procedures are in use&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reliability and operability is included in the design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment standardization is evident&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills (hard and soft) training is continuous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loss elimination is ongoing; overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is being measured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Small cross-functional teams are solving problems (failure modes and effects analyses, five-why&amp;rsquo;s, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;TPM is Operator Driven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The operators&amp;rsquo; creed of TPM is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it clean&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it lubricated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor for degradation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain it before production is affected&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Simplify and improve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d759dc67-600c-4ea8-b594-8313224c954f_scheller01.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These elements are all carried out in a thorough asset care regimen. The investigative part of this regimen also attempts to catch incipient problems by monitoring assets for both visual (qualitative) and measurable (quantitative) indications of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with the inspection processes of the program, an operator care process focuses on continued education of operators (all shifts), maintenance and reliability staff. Operator care puts high emphasis on both operator-managed inspection programs and lubrication management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Origins of TPM/AM and Operator Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the 1950s, the Japanese industry, faced with considerable challenges, developed a variant of planned maintenance now known as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). As with planned maintenance, frequent inspections are a fundamental tenet of the TPM process, with a heavy emphasis on involving equipment operators in the inspection process. Operator care is derived from several of the concepts (&amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo;) of TPM. Some of these concepts are found in the sample slides shared below. They are from a TPM conference in India and are courtesy of Shiram Pistons &amp;amp; Rings Ltd., an automotive manufacturer in that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/3c2d7048-7c27-4aa8-b229-7f219a4b49a2_scheller02.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 364px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. Fusion of Corporate Management &amp;amp; TPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d5d7e1b0-5646-4412-8bda-7163a1bf9e9e_scheller03.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 355px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7. People Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care and Six Sigma, CI, Other Asset Improvement Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A Six Sigma (DMAIC) systemic quality program provides businesses with the tools to improve the capability of their business processes. Six Sigma can be defined as a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects in a wide variety of processes, which includes all forms of manufacturing and process industries. A key element of Six Sigma programs is &amp;ldquo;kaizen&amp;rdquo;, the Japanese process of continuous improvement using a variety of problem-solving and analysis techniques. One of the fundamentals of the Six Sigma approach is the requirement for data. Data sets are used to determine the original state of a process, the current state of that process, the rate of improvement and the proximity of the process to the desired quality levels. Operator care, with its emphasis on frequent and rigorously scheduled inspections, produces a steady stream of both quantified and qualified evaluations of assets, systems and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data collected by these inspections, plus the data generated to measure the compliance to the operator care inspection schedule itself, can be used effectively to generate metrics for any Six Sigma program. A well-run basic asset care program is not only a catalyst for improvement in and of itself; it can also be one of the primary data gathering tools to evaluate the effectiveness of all continuous improvement procedures within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care is Part of Overall Asset Management and Reliability Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care fits in as a foundational element of a site&amp;rsquo;s total plant operational and Reliability Excellence strategy. The strategy details the availability and contribution of a plant&amp;rsquo;s resources to be used in asset inspection, condition monitoring, planning and scheduling, and logistics for the creation of a reliability program. The strategy provides for optimal use of organizational resources with sufficient asset availability to meet the organization&amp;rsquo;s output requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A modern plant asset management effort uses the skill sets available within the organization (and through the judicious use of external expertise) to generate improvements in all elements of LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Excellence model (see &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html"&gt;www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of implementing all integrated elements holistically can consequently lead to substantial performance improvements, value creation and securing a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of TPM/AM Operator Care Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care programs have been implemented in hundreds of organizations &amp;ndash; both in process and discrete manufacturing facilities. Benefits of a successfully implemented asset care and reliability improvement program include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improvement in OEE&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Manufacturing Cost Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Labor Utilization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Production Lead Time Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Positive Impact on EHS performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Quick Response Manufacturing as an alternative to lean</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Professor Suri tells about Quick Response Manufacturing at BoschScharnieren in Doetinchem, the Netherlands. QRM is a companywide strategy for lead-time reduction throughout the enterprise. Using QRM, companies have reduced their lead times by 80 to 90 percent. As a result, these companies have not only seen large increases in market share, but also experienced significant cost reduction and quality improvement. Although lean manufacturing techniques can be powerful in certain situations, for companies making low-volume or custom-engineered products, lean techniques do not apply too well. Quick Response Manufacturing can be a more effective competitive strategy for companies targeting such markets.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>16 organizations to receive site visits for 2010 Baldrige Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Panel of Judges for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the nation&amp;rsquo;s highest recognition for organizational performance excellence, has selected 16 organizations for the final review stage for the 2010 Award. Starting next month, teams of business, education, health care and nonprofit experts will make site visits to two organizations in the manufacturing category, four in small business, one in service, one in education, seven in health care and one in non-profit. This is the first year since the addition of the newest category, non-profit (in 2007), in which organizations from all six categories will receive site visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program received 83 applications in 2010 (three manufacturers, two service companies, seven small businesses, 10 educational organizations, 54 health care organizations and seven non-profit/governmental organizations). The applicants were evaluated rigorously by an independent board of examiners in seven areas: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis and knowledge management; workforce focus; process management; and results. Examiners will provide 300 to 1,000 hours of review to each applicant receiving a site visit, and all applicants will receive a detailed report on the organization&amp;rsquo;s strengths and opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 Baldrige Award recipients are expected to be announced in late November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987. The award &amp;ndash; managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with the private sector &amp;ndash; promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance strategies. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 80 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thousands of organizations use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence to guide their enterprises, improve performance and get sustainable results. This proven improvement and innovation framework offers organizations an integrated approach to key management areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Pittsburgh Glass Works hires lean manufacturing expert to head quality efforts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Pittsburgh Glass Works (PGW) LLC, a world-leading supplier of automotive glass and services, announced September 7 that the company is taking proactive steps to enhance quality systems in order to meet customer needs and continue to be a leader in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As we continue to successfully deploy growth strategies and expand our customer base, both in the automotive replacement glass and OEM sectors, it is critical for us to continue to enhance our quality performance with our customers,&amp;quot; said Joseph D. Stas, executive vice president and chief operating officer, PGW. &amp;quot;Operational excellence is more crucial today than ever due to increasing customer demands, as well as fierce competitive challenges. We are taking new steps to enhance our focus and to continue PGW&amp;#39;s growth as a premier global automotive glass organization.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To lead this enhanced focus on quality, PGW announced that Richard Corliss has joined the company as director of quality. In this role, Corliss will assume overall responsibility of PGW&amp;#39;s global quality organization. His primary focus will be collaborating with PGW&amp;#39;s manufacturing and commercial teams to proactively enhance the company&amp;#39;s quality systems from end to end to meet PGW&amp;#39;s ever-increasing and diverse customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corliss has 35 years of management, quality and operations leadership experience. In his most current position with Tinnerman Palnut Engineered Products, he was director, engineering and quality, and worked with plant managers and local quality managers to root cause and countermeasure internal product and processing challenges, as well as optimize quality opportunities as identified through internal reviews and cooperative discussion with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corliss also had corporate accountability for ensuring new product launches were managed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to his position with Tinnerman, Corliss spent 30 years with Alcoa. His last assignment was as manager, quality &amp;amp; technology, for Alcoa Wheel and Forged Products. His many quality positions with Alcoa gave him significant lean manufacturing, international accountability and process improvement experience. This expertise, along with his management skills and problem-solving background, provide a solid foundation for driving ongoing enhancement of PGW&amp;#39;s quality systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corliss will report to Stas at PGW&amp;#39;s global headquarters in Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Pittsburgh Glass Works&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Pittsburgh Glass Works (PGW) supplies automotive OEM windshields, rear and side windows, sunroofs and assemblies for auto and truck manufacturers, and it supplies and distributes replacement automotive glass products for use in the aftermarket. It also provides insurance claims services through its LYNX Services subsidiary, glass management software and internet marketing services through its GTS subsidiary, and e-business solutions through its GLAXIS offering.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lean methods and safety help manufacturers survive in tough times</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With manufacturers across the country looking to save costs in every place possible, it&amp;#39;s no wonder that lean manufacturing and safety have become the cornerstone of financially responsible business practices. Saving thousands on inventory, resources and workers&amp;#39; compensation claims, these programs have aided many companies in surviving the recession. The 2010 Compensation Data Manufacturing survey results found that 69.7 percent of manufacturing companies utilize lean manufacturing practices.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the various lean manufacturing practices used, 5-S programs were most prevalent at 69.2 percent. This was followed by Six Sigma and kaizen at 58.6 percent and 55.7 percent, respectively. Value stream mapping was used by 47.3 percent of manufacturers. Survey respondents employed kanban at a rate of 40.6 percent. Takt time analysis was used the least, 22.1 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By implementing lean manufacturing practices, companies gain the potential to save thousands while increasing their bottom lines,&amp;quot; said Amy Kaminski, director of marketing for Compdata Surveys, the nation&amp;#39;s leading compensation and benefits survey data provider. &amp;quot;Keeping production and quality levels high, while minimizing waste, will be the key to remaining competitive as the economic climate improves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many manufacturers have also found value in obtaining ISO 9000 certification. To gain certification, companies must follow procedures established by the International Standards Organization to ensure quality products. According to the newly released results, 56.4 percent of organizations have obtained ISO 9000 certification. Of those who have obtained certification, durable goods companies reported the largest percentage, 67.5 percent. This was followed by non-durable goods manufacturers at 46.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Learn from inspirational keynote speakers at AME conference</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As many manufacturers begin their journey through an economic recovery phase, it is vital to uphold a solid organizational foundation that will help create and sustain global success. Building excellence inside is inevitable at the 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference, hosted by the Association for Manufacturing Excellence (AME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From November 15-19 in Baltimore, Md., an expected 2,500 manufacturing practitioners from around North America will learn from six inspirational keynote speakers who will share their Lean strategies and success stories. Each of these leaders explore continuous improvement and best practices on a daily basis. Through their experiences, conference attendees will discover innovative decision-making methods, enhanced leadership skills, money-saving strategies and more efficient business processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference will begin with a motivational message from Dr. John Izzo, author of &amp;ldquo;Five Secrets You Must Discover Before You Die&amp;rdquo; and one of &lt;em&gt;Leadership Excellence&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;rsquo;s Top 100 Thought Leaders in North America. He will discuss how organizations can reach sustainable success through the integration of values and purposeful leadership and business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. John Toussaint, CEO of the ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value, will present on lean thinking in the healthcare industry. Specifically, he will draw on his experience introducing his company to the ThedaCare Improvement System, a continuous improvement model that helped save millions in healthcare costs, while delivering better quality care to patients.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Speaking on the strategic importance of customer experience and company culture will be Colleen Abdoulah, CEO of WOW! Internet, Cable and Phone, and the only female to lead a Top 20 cable company in that position. Attendees will also hear her discuss the development of gender-balanced management and leadership and cultivation of authentic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Howard Putnam, author of &amp;ldquo;The Winds of Turbulence&amp;rdquo; and former CEO of Southwest Airlines, will present on how successful organizations get through the maze of the business world. Specifically, he will explore thinking outside of the box, organizational visions and developing a people-centered culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a principal investor in several Lean enterprises, George Koenigsaecker has significant experience leading lean initiatives. He developed and implemented the &amp;ldquo;Danaher Business System,&amp;rdquo; a comprehensive lean enterprise model, and led the HON Company&amp;rsquo;s lean conversion, which tripled the volume for the office furniture manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Malcolm Gladwell, author of &amp;ldquo;Outliers: The Story of Success&amp;rdquo; and one of &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;100 Most Influential People,&amp;rdquo; will conclude the conference. In his address, Gladwell will explore factors that truly foster success, new tools to understand how trends work and how leaders can master successful decision-making. A staff writer for The New Yorker, his work has been described as idea-driven narratives focused on the everyday, and a combination of research with more personal, social and historical material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In its 26th year of progress, AME is pleased to offer participants countless network opportunities, practitioner-to-practitioner and company-to-company shared-learning experiences, and innovative Lean tools and strategies at the 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference.
