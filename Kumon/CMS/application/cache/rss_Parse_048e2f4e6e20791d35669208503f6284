            <title>How a PM Program Can Reduce Downtime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/12/2/68e22b9c-b95a-472a-be2c-8fdd62f72c25_pm-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 289px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;How effective is preventive maintenance (PM) in reducing downtime? As with many questions related to maintenance, the answer is &amp;quot;it depends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;#39;ll illustrate with an example. In a large, multi-line pulp-and-paper mill, a 20-inch knife-gate valve on the main effluent header failed, shutting down the entire operation for three days. As manufactured, the stainless-steel valve yoke had been attached to the valve body with stitch welds. Those welds failed, likely from fatigue. The pressure forced the spade out of the valve, and the escaping 180-degree effluent submerged the effluent lift pumps that feed the treatment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Could this failure have been avoided if the preventive maintenance system had been better designed? It could not, at least not economically in a process plant like a paper mill. The reasoning was that if the scope of the PM inspection program included regular checks on items such as manufacturers&amp;#39; shop welds on all plant equipment as well as other possible checks at that level of detail, then it would be unrealistically expensive. PM inspections for that plant should be limited to probable failure modes on most equipment. This event was not the result of a probable failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the downtime in the plant was analyzed over a number of years, the total losses from &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unlikely&amp;quot; failure modes were nearly equal. The unlikely failures were less frequent, but each one resulted in a large production loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, the depth to which it is reasonable (and economical) to search for potential failures depends on the criticality of the equipment, defined as the consequence of failure. For instance, during the design and maintenance of commercial aircraft, every possible failure mode for each component is examined, and actions are taken to either prevent failure or to prevent a failure from affecting the safety of the aircraft (e.g., by providing back-up systems). Such analysis in a large manufacturing operation is usually not economical or necessary. However, for very critical systems, such as those containing hazardous chemicals, a much more rigorous design process and a correspondingly higher level of inspection detail is justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what action should be taken when an unlikely failure occurs? One possibility is to extend the PM program to include that specific mode of failure on all similar equipment. This is only practical if the failure development period for each failure mode is long enough to allow regular inspections to detect a potential failure with enough warning for repairs to be made before a breakdown occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best way to deal with unlikely failures is to conduct a root cause analysis and take whatever action is required to prevent similar failures in the future. This often involves some redesign. In the case of the valve example, the attachment of the valve yoke to the valve body was redesigned to prevent further failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	PM Program Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the PM program is well-designed, most of the &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; failure modes can be avoided with a reasonable failure development time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Good downtime records are of great value when setting up a PM program. After one plant recorded all of its production losses against the equipment that caused them, a Pareto analysis revealed that 80 percent of all unscheduled maintenance downtime could be attributed to 87 items, or less than 1 percent of more than 12,000 equipment items. A new PM program that focused on these 87 items and similar equipment reduced unscheduled maintenance downtime by more than 50 percent within 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a process plant, such as a pulp-and-paper mill, PM inspections should consume no more than 15-20 percent of available maintenance manpower. It is also a good &amp;quot;system check&amp;quot; to occasionally compare the total hours of work generated by your PM program each year with your total available manpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/vKnio5tCD_I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Minimize Waste with a Smooth Work Flow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common performance metrics is planned vs. unplanned work orders. The benchmark goal has been 90 percent planned (preventive maintenance and other planned activities) and 10 percent unplanned corrective/breakdown maintenance. In reality, with most organizations the ratio is anywhere from 10 to 30 percent planned maintenance to 90 to 70 percent unplanned. This is indicative of operating in a reactive mode, which contributes to waste, reduced equipment life and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A thorough understanding and analysis of a maintenance work process flow makes it easier to identify and eliminate waste. The goal is not only to eliminate waste but to develop an improved work process flow that is more effective and productive. As the flow is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed, the entire process flow becomes visible and wasteful activities such as delays, unnecessary travel and the like are easily identified.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some ways to minimize wasteful activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Trending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring usually involves the use of installed devices (gauges, meters, etc.) to monitor the operating conditions of equipment and other assets. An example is pressure and temperature readings on a boiler. Maintenance can establish operating limits for the condition(s) being monitored and trend the observed data. If the observed data is outside of a certain predefined range of values, some maintenance action may be required. This is referred to as condition-based maintenance. It can be very effective and less expensive than periodic or fixed frequency maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning and Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planner/scheduler&amp;rsquo;s role is very important in a lean maintenance environment. The goal is to optimize utilization of available resources. Detailed job plans should be developed for all approved open work orders including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number and type of labor resources (how many plumbers, carpenters, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time estimates so required manpower can be determined&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detailed job steps including permit/safety requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Parts and tool requirements (pre-kit if possible)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clear job instructions, drawings, sketches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job site walk down to determine the most efficient way of doing the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment availability coordination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Outside contractor requirements (if any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Delays must be avoided at all cost. Weekly scheduling must be done with daily fine tuning as necessary. This level of detail and coordination is required to achieve a lean and efficient maintenance operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Streamline Your Maintenance Operation for Optimum Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If your backlog is piling up or you feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources in terms of labor and parts, it may be time to work toward lean maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance is the application of lean philosophies, methods, tools and techniques to maintenance functions. It has the fundamental goals of eliminating waste associated with labor, inventory, procedures and techniques, resulting in improved productivity and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance does not imply a slash and dash approach to cutting costs and jobs. This common method will not reduce waste or lower costs. Instead, lean maintenance philosophy decreases costs by getting rid of waste that can be defined as &amp;ldquo;anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add value to the maintenance process or service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are a few areas where wastefulness and sluggishness can crop up in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Overproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overproduction in the maintenance environment means doing any work that does not add value. Examples include performing preventive and predictive maintenance tasks more often than is necessary and redoing jobs that were not done correctly the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Areas of waste in this category include maintenance personnel waiting for equipment availability, job assignments, tools, parts, instructions, other crafts, permit approval, etc. Waiting is not a value-added activity and should be eliminated or reduced as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary travel is the result of ineffective planning and scheduling. This could involve a trip to the maintenance shop to get technical information or to the storeroom for parts and tools. Poorly designed preventive maintenance (PM) routes are also a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Process Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When performing a breakdown repair, maintenance personnel are typically under a lot of pressure to fix the equipment as quickly as possible and often are not given enough time to fix the equipment properly. This results in a poor repair and a recurring problem. Properly performed repairs can eliminate this process waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most organizations now use some sort of computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM). Process waste also occurs when inefficiencies exist in these systems. For example, a poorly designed system may call for multiple entries of the same data, or a material requisitioning process could require redundant approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In maintenance, a defect can be defined as leaving an asset in an unreliable condition. There are many causes of defects in the maintenance environment. Defects due to poor workmanship arise from insufficient training, inadequate/outdated procedures and not having the proper tools to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Spare Parts Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most storerooms contain a significant amount of obsolete inventory. This ties up capital and consumes management resources. It can easily amount to 10 to 20 percent of annual inventory dollars. Keep in mind that excess inventory is not obsolete but is inventory maintained at unnecessarily high levels. Excess inventory also ties up capital and consumes management resources. In addition, inadequate PM programs cause equipment failures, which in turn results in the need for more parts (consuming working capital) and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A CMMS/EAM can monitor and control a spare parts inventory. It will keep track of inventory items, vendor performance, parts receipts, issues and returns. In addition, a CMMS/EAM can automate the parts purchasing process. Vendor managed and stocked inventory can also drastically reduce the parts quantity in the storeroom and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While breakdowns and failures are never planned, they can cause the loss of productivity and money. Finding the root cause of a failure provides an organization with a solvable problem. Once the root cause is identified, a fix can be developed and implemented, preventing a recurring failure situation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prioritizing Maintenance Work Orders</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the challenges that many organizations face is maintaining work order priorities in the wake of the emotional squeaky wheel that yells the loudest. Remember the phrase, &amp;ldquo;In God we trust. All others bring data&amp;rdquo;? It applies here as well. Reacting to false priorities exacerbates the reactive spiral that diverts resources from efficient work practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the day, I don&amp;rsquo;t know of many organizations that are overwhelmed with maintenance resources to do work. Reality is that maintenance activities are all about lessening or mitigating risk or the consequences of failure. The challenge for all involved in determining the potential risk is to estimate the probability of the breakdown occurring within a period of time. To succeed, it is important that maintenance and operations have a proactive partnership where they work together to understand and communicate the risk probability via the work order system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to effectively accomplish this, the organization should have a priority matrix. This is a matrix chart with the estimated time to the potential breakdown or functional failure on one side (typically in days) and the consequences of failure on the other side (90 degrees out). Categories may include health and safety, environmental, operations loss,&amp;nbsp; and customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the organization establishes the matrix, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect people to understand the intent without training. Train everyone and hold them accountable. Early on, frequently inspect to ensure that the organization is properly following the matrix when coding the priority on the work orders and requests. Put at least a monthly audit process in place to ensure compliance is ongoing. That said, recognize that it&amp;rsquo;s a tool and not the end-all. It&amp;rsquo;s an estimate that you use to set the target date for the work to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integrate the work-order priority into other work such as preventive maintenance activities and engineering projects when you create the maintenance schedules. Using this technique, only interrupt the prioritized schedule work with work of a higher or more urgent priority. Work already in progress should take priority over new work of the same or equal priority. This will help you to avoid &amp;ldquo;breaking the schedule&amp;rdquo; unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/ICbOSL-pmrM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Expert Tips for Planning a CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A well-planned and executed computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) project can yield a maximum return on your investment. This return is realized through increased efficiency, productivity and profits. However, a poorly planned and executed CMMS project can result in a loss of revenue. These losses can be measured in terms of the overall investment in the project, as well as from wasted time and lost projected revenue forecast tied to the successful installation and implementation of a CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Properly planning the CMMS implementation project is one of the key elements. In the planning phase, you determine the &amp;ldquo;what,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;why,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developing a plan for equipment data is a good first step because it will provide a CMMS with a foundation of hard, verifiable data. Some maintenance departments may already employ an equipment numbering scheme that is effective. This can easily be translated into the CMMS. If there is no scheme currently in place or if the current one is flawed, it is time to develop an equipment numbering scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determining an equipment hierarchy is the next step. This involves setting up parent/child relationships among equipment. For example, an air handler can have pumps and motors as children. If you are going to keep track of both the parent and children, the relationship must be documented. Make sure to include every piece of equipment that falls under that hierarchy scheme. Parent/child relationships also can be constructed for whole facilities. For instance, a building could be the parent with each floor a child. Each room could then be a child of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information on spare parts should be tagged to the individual pieces of equipment. This is referred to as the bill of material (BOM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, you need to decide what you want from your CMMS in terms of downtime monitoring. You should choose which pieces of equipment you want to monitor as well as how you want to track planned vs. unplanned downtime. Plan based on impact or loss of operation. You should have this information for each piece of equipment or at least for critical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Preventive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following decisions have to be made for each preventive maintenance (PM) task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM be performed by calendar time or run time (miles, hours, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM follow a fixed schedule (regardless of completion date) or a schedule based on completion date?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often will PM work orders be generated (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the strategies for route-based PMs? (For example, an inspection route for all fire extinguishers in a building.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Procedures can be preventive maintenance, safety instructions or any other set of instructions. Each piece of equipment should have identified for it all the preventive, corrective and predictive maintenance tasks necessary to properly maintain that equipment. Along with the maintenance task, information regarding maintenance frequency, responsible craft, repair and/or consumable parts necessary to compete the maintenance task, and time estimated to compete the task are some of the additional information that will enhance the usefulness of your CMMS database. These procedures can then be applied anywhere within the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need information on each maintenance technician such as name, address, phone, Social Security number, etc. You also have to decide if you are going to use some sort of ID card for your technicians that can be scanned by a reader. If you do, will the cards be produced in-house or by an outside vendor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following actions must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, you have to develop a part-numbering scheme. This is similar to the process used for equipment numbering. Some companies use a 20- to 30-character-long part-numbering scheme. It includes every detail of that part (i.e., type of part, thickness, diameter, location, etc.). With advances in CMMS and a field available for each of these details (category, dimensions, location, etc.), you don&amp;rsquo;t need a part-numbering scheme to include all of the details. It just increases the potential for data-entry errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implicit in the development of a part-numbering scheme is the need to concretely define the details of parts. The most useful in terms of work flow is defining the location of a part. Is there one or multiple stockrooms? Is there a location scheme within the stockroom (i.e., aisle, bins, shelves, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the data-gathering phase, you will compile a list of all the vendors from which you buy parts and services. One of them should be assigned as a primary vendor for each part. The CMMS automatically generates purchase orders to the primary vendors. This can be changed by the users if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this stage, you have to decide the criteria for selecting a primary vendor (i.e., price, delivery, overall service, etc.). Additionally, you should track vendor/manufacturer part numbers for cross-referencing purposes. You also need to decide the issue units that you are going to use (metric, British or a combination of both). How are you going to handle inventory of pipes, beams, etc.? Are you going to keep track of lengths? If a piece is cut, are you going to keep track of the remaining pipe length? Once vendor and tracking information is decided upon, you also need to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who has the authority to order parts and up to what amount?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Beyond what amount will further approval be required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the overall planning of the physical inventory process, you must make the following decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often are you going to take the physical inventory?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who is going to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is it going to be manual or using mobile technology? If it is manual, make sure your CMMS has the capability to print the appropriate forms for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Associated with this step is development of a parts label design and barcode label design. What information do you want to print on the parts labels? Part number, description and location are typical. If you are using barcoding with inventory, you have to decide which information items you want barcoded. Part number and location are typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have multiple plants/facilities, it is important that every facility follows the same schemes. Without consistency, the CMMS will not be very effective. If you are looking for a part at a different facility and that facility describes the part differently than you do, you may not find it even if it is in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Purchasing and Accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You likely will need the purchasing and accounting departments involved in the planning phase for these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Bill to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Ship to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales tax rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine budget accounts and amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should determine what plan and design codes will be used throughout the CMMS. During the planning phase, you need to decide on strategies for the basis of codes. Actual compilation of codes will be done during the data-gathering phase. Determine the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Account codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order type&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Action codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order priority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment criticality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purchase order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are employing mobile applications, you need to identify each application and work on articulating the details. Some examples include using a hand-held remote data-entry device to collect equipment meter readings, parts can be issued and/or returned using a hand-held device, hand-held devices can be used to count and track inventory parts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Decisions also need to be made regarding data backup. An articulated backup scheme should be formed that takes into account both hardware and setup. Determine how often backup will be done (daily, weekly, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan for the type of maintenance history you want to maintain. Your decisions should include date performed, task performed, the person(s) who performed the job, estimated and actual time to perform, equipment performed on, material used, and any outside contractor cost incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several decisions need to be made regarding the general operation of your CMMS. These questions provide information not only for planning but also for evaluating current capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are you going to print estimated time on work orders?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What details of reports are needed in your CMMS?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Which reports are needed in graphics format?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What decisions will be made based on reports analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Security issues: Who is permitted to do what?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field legends: Do you need to change the terms provided by your CMMS on any of the legends? If yes, be sure to document the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop a list of KPIs for your application. At this stage, you should review them and revise, if necessary. Also, determine how you would compute those KPIs. Most of the KPIs should come from CMMS reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assign Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan on who will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Install the hardware (if necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the computer hardware, backups, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform archiving and merging of data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take care of disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Generate reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review and analyze various reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan and schedule work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do the ongoing data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be responsible for customizing, configuring, tailoring and maintaining the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning stage of a CMMS is perhaps one of the most important in ensuring success. Granted, implementation itself is not a short process, but with a well-laid-out plan where all possibilities are considered, the process will be simpler and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The major challenge in planning a CMMS is considering the entire breadth of your operation down to every last piece of equipment, part and facility, and then remaining realistic with your goals. Consider the abilities of your operation to adapt to a new technology in a manner that will not unduly disrupt workflow. With a laid-out plan, you will reap the rewards for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/jZOu2G5HsJE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Waste to Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems as if new weight-loss programs and products come out every week. One of the latest is a plastic wrap you place around your stomach. If you strap it around your stomach, you will sweat and lose weight. Brilliant! Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably sweat if you wrap anything air-tight around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the more interesting thought is to wonder why we fall for this stuff over and over when we all know the basic concepts in weight loss, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less energy intake will reduce fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More exercise will burn fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More muscle mass will increase metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you know and understand these basic principles of weight loss, you can apply them and become very successful in losing weight. You will learn that it takes hard work to improve your metabolism and that it is a long-term lifestyle commitment, not a short-term project. This sounds awfully similar to reliability improvements, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Perhaps that is because both topics are maintenance, just with different equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is one of the newer concepts or buzzwords around maintenance. The lean philosophy encourages us to look at waste. What is waste in maintenance? Typically (not always), the largest waste is environmental and safety issues, followed by downtime of production equipment. There are also other losses such as damage due to catastrophic failures, wasted labor due to poor management system, high cost of parts and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key in the lean philosophy is to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we reduce waste?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that we improve equipment reliability. As we all know, the key elements to improve equipment reliability are to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning and scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spare parts management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technical database&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Root-cause analysis practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering and design with consideration to reliability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills development on all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept &amp;ldquo;lean maintenance&amp;rdquo; and all other new reliability improvement concepts often provide interesting angles and viewpoints, but you will end up with the same answers. To be quite honest, there are new technologies, but not much new has happened with work practices lately. The list above has been true since 1972. The hard part is doing the things in the list, not coming up with the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is just another word used to convey doing the basics, but the angle is different. I recommend reading Shigeo Shingo&amp;rsquo;s classic book &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Principles of Lean Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; and applying the basic principles to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/1GrkucLhNqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Maintain an Equipment Registry </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment registry is one of the most important tools in your kit when it comes to maintenance and reliability. It can be the foundation of your planned maintenance, lubrication, training and repair programs, as well as help with regulatory compliance and safety programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your spare parts management program depends upon a complete and accurate registry with the requisite analysis for regular service parts along with the insurance spares identified through failure modes and effects analysis. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that your financials are also tied in through depreciation, amortization and cost center assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment history gets tied to the registry along with manuals, drawings, procedures, labor costs and reports. That is why it is the foundation upon which so much is built, and that is why it is so vital that you get it right and work to maintain its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it has an initial cost and a maintenance cost, the payback can be significant and continuous, so make the investment even if you have to bump something else down the list. The man-hours that you save long term will repay your investment many times over. You can consider the downtime and spares savings as icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What the Registry Should Look Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have an enterprise asset management (EAM) or computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), you are already set up with specific fields in a database. Review those fields to be sure that they satisfy your needs and then examine the registry for completeness and accuracy. You may be able to rename some fields to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an EAM or CMMS with built-in equipment registry, or you are evaluating a program for your plant, then be sure that it provides a minimum number of data fields for the basic information you need. This is one of those cases where more is better. Of course, smaller plants can manage with cheaper versions of programs or even with simple spreadsheets if they are configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a bare minimum, you will need fields such as equipment name, manufacturer name, model number, serial number, location installed in the plant, description and date installed. You can add fields for service vendor, warranty period, capacity, functional location, superior equipment number, bill of materials (BOM) file number (if not included as a separate function in your software), and the original purchase order number if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is what you call it for your records. Make this understandable to everyone, and don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of abbreviations or acronyms if they are common to your process. You can form the standard here for your plant, so think about it up front. You will put this on labels, reports, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) screens, procedures, and work order titles, so it needs to have a structure that makes sense. A standardized structure will be necessary because you will also sort data like work orders by this name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Manufacturer Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and not the guy who sold it to you or installed it. List that outfit under the vendor name or in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Model Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This number connects you to OEM manuals and services, and works with the serial number to tell your vendor exactly which machine you are talking about when you call for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Serial Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serial number with the model number is very important information. With just the model and serial number, the OEM can usually pull up any information you need on parts and procedures. Verify that what you have recorded matches the actual nameplate on the unit. Some manufacturers maintain separate part numbers and drawing numbers for each serial number unit. Plus, there may be some subtle differences in your unit because of a special requirement that is only recorded in the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specific serial number record. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to order a $10,000 part, wait eight weeks for it to arrive and then find it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Date Installed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You use this date for warranty coverage, for depreciation financials and for setting up initial service and preventive maintenance schedules. It can also help managers decide if it is time to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is your in-house location code. Some large companies include country and plant codes on the front, but the basics are building, floor and quadrant. You can also use column numbers in the place of or in addition to the quadrant code to narrow it down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time when you establish your standard nomenclature for your equipment. It needs to be descriptive, standard and universally understood. Limit this to 40 to 60 characters for ease of sorting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment field is a free-form text block that you use to capture what the equipment does for your plant and any special information that you want available for use, such as the vendor name, unit capacity or anything else you feel is important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do it anywhere else, take this opportunity to record the design capacity and the machine&amp;rsquo;s relationship to other equipment (e.g., supply fan 04 for HVAC unit 03-03-12 with capacity of 1,500 cfm @ 5&amp;Prime;w.c.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of your equipment registry cannot be emphasized enough. Your technical training, spare parts, financials and work order systems all depend on accurate equipment records. Good records can shorten the troubleshooting times, facilitate training of new personnel, capture modification events, contribute to better management decisions by providing timely and dependable financial data, and increase reliability over the lifespan of the equipment. Couple these records with a labeling program and you can expect to enjoy good experiences with your installed equipment base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/qFExzFbYM4U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~3/otkPapUcR7g/smart-redundancy-reliability</link>

            <title>Employ Smart Redundancy for Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nuclear submarines are high-reliability designs that have redundancy built into them. Many of these systems are split into two halves (port and starboard), and each system has two pumps (a total of four). Each side could run fully on one pump. Then the two halves are cross-connected, so the entire system could run at partial capacity on a single pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of this redundancy comes at a cost &amp;mdash; about $1 billion in this particular case. Naturally, one of the comments I hear when describing these systems is that we could never afford such redundancy in our profit-making companies. I challenge that there is a place for what I call &amp;ldquo;smart redundancy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smart redundancy has to do with taking a critical look at your systems, looking at risks and searching for opportunities where a little redundancy may pay big dividends. Utility and packaging systems are ripe for this kind of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One utility case in point is a fresh-water supply I inherited. After drawing the water from a well and treating it, a single pump provided the pressure to supply the entire factory. Failure of the single pump or its motor, electrical controls or pressure switch would shut down the entire factory within about three minutes. Depending on the failure, we could be down from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While we performed preventive maintenance on the components, the harsh environment of this pump still resulted in occasional failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some study, we decided to put in a second pump, with a pressure set point a little lower than the first. The pump cost us around $2,000; with installation and controls, it was a bit more. But the point is we never, ever shut down the entire plant again for lack of water, and we offset the entire cost by avoiding only a few minutes of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Packaging lines present their own problems. We often put 10 or more components in series (including the conveyors), and the failure of any one will shut down the entire line. Even if each component has a 97-percent uptime, the line will only perform at 74 percent (.97 x .97 x etc. for 10 times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have you experienced a time when an upstream component on one line was down at the same time as a downstream component on another line? Suddenly two lines are not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you could cross-connect the two lines somewhere in the middle, you could avoid some of these cases. That is sometimes as easy to do as designing a movable rail where two conveyors run together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t let the newspaper headline in your town read, &amp;ldquo;$2,000 pump shuts down entire factory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/otkPapUcR7g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Saving Time and Money with Condition Monitoring </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent acoustic emission (AE) study identified a potential critical bearing failure that became a planned preventive action for a leading food manufacturer. This also avoided considerable cost and unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic emission equipment and the main tool used during the planned inspection routes were manufactured by Holroyd Instruments. This example will show the value of this type of equipment in avoiding a major unplanned event that could have had massive cost consequences for the business. Collateral damage to the associated equipment would have proved very costly, and the lead time to rebuild could have caused extensive downtime that would have meant disgruntled customers not being able to rely on stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story began in April 2010 when some initial elevated readings were noted at two node points on a large step-down transfer gearbox that were sampled on a seven-day routine. The distress readings were elevated and triggered the alarm level. They were of concern and evident on subsequent inspections. The third elevated reading that was part of an upward trend instigated a planned work order in the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) to investigate and take further action. This equipment could not be taken out of service lightly, as it was at the time constrained by high production demands. Experience with a sister line&amp;rsquo;s previous planned bearing change also played an important part in the escalation of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/9947803a-3bb4-493b-9873-9b1e92eff658_gearbox.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 558px; height: 352px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The input side of a transfer gearbox is shown with the output bearing node point on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On more detailed inspections, it was determined that the bearing with the highest distress was indeed the suspected output bearing. Audible clicks were loud and clear at the output end bearing. The two bearings at the node locations were on the drive line of the motor at the input and output ends of the transfer gearbox. The adjacent bearings on the large, helical step-down gear were still reading low and had no audible clicks. The engineering manager was advised that there was an anomaly on one of the input bearings, that the others were in good condition and that production could continue with targeted condition monitoring. The routine oil sampling was increased from monthly to every two weeks. AE inspections were increased, with spectrum readings now on a four-day cycle. This would give some comparative evidence when the new bearings were eventually fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned change of the bearing set was arranged with the production planner, maintenance manager and product specialist. It became clear that the equipment would have to operate for at least another six months until it became available. Contingency plans were formulated for an emergency change if any of the AE readings or oil samples showed advances toward failure. Warnings were issued that this could occur rapidly if the bearing failed. A new bearing set was purchased, and a meeting was scheduled with the bearing manufacturer to examine the used bearings when they were eventually changed in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AE readings stayed at an elevated level during this long waiting phase, and oil sample results showed no elevated readings in the key elements associated with roller bearing failures. During the weeks before renewal, many spectra were taken from all points of the gearbox for future evaluation. This would rule out frequencies from the oil pump and other components around the assembly. An AE envelope spectrum graph before the bearing change is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/254014f7-f16e-44dd-96f8-d80ead41bf1d_spectra 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 630px; height: 209px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As can be seen, there was something creating a spike at 73Hz, which happened to match the frequency of the bearing race. This provided a clue that there was a race surface defect of some kind and not an element breaking down or the cage disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing change finally took place, and the production plant was turned around within 12 hours so that the equipment did not incur any unplanned downtime. The used bearing set was returned with the transfer gearbox, and the two units were degreased. On first inspection, they both looked similar and in good order. The elements and cages were then dismantled from the outer and inner races, with care taken to keep them in order and in the correct aspect for reassembly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It became clear that on the suspect output bearing, a major spall on the inner race had developed, and every element was pitted with the debris that had emitted. At this point, a representative from the bearing manufacturer was invited to visit and examine the bearings. He concurred that the bearings had lasted very well considering the atmosphere and heat in which they had operated for almost 10 years. This would be considered an end-of-lifetime mode of failure. It may have lasted many more months or could have accelerated to failure within days or weeks. The photograph below is of the spall that measured approximately 10 mm in length and 2.5 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/3a11d97c-28b7-4388-aa85-57dc40e9a028_spall damage.jpeg" style="width: 630px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Spall damage to the race is shown above with feathered edges and surface pitting in the loaded area of the spalling. Note the next layer of material on the right-hand side that would have given way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the remedial work had been completed, additional spectrum samples were recorded and monitored to learn more. Carpet noise levels were lower, and the decibel scale was a third of the previous graph example. The maximum peak was now less than 0.4 decibels, while the carpet level was less than 0.2 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the systems and tools relied on every day proved effective in capturing this anomaly before it turned into a major event. The key to this was the full involvement of engineering with operations to plan in the remedial work with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the lessons learned were that the inspection frequencies at seven-day intervals were correct for this critical plant, the preventive action was started at the earliest opportunity, the equipment enabled the pinpointing of the bearing fault, the audio facility allowed a second reference that linked rpm with the audible clicks and that this all gave sufficient evidence for the planned work to commence at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root-cause analysis was carried out directly after the bearing change was completed to investigate any future recommendations for servicing this equipment. It was decided that as the bearings had reached their end-of-life cycle, there was no need to alter any future planned maintenance. Condition monitoring with AE had provided the confidence to pick up any anomalies at a very early stage in the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Autonomous Operator Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does autonomous operator maintenance mean? The &amp;ldquo;autonomous&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;me alone performing the maintenance tasks for which I am trained and qualified.&amp;rdquo; Is it something new? To those of us who knew cars before electronic ignition and computers, owning a car fostered a do-it-myself approach toward keeping it running. I always pumped my own gas, changed my oil and filters, and sometimes changed my belts. I could check the levels of fluids, read gauges and listen to the running engine for anomalies. Technology has given me diagnostic tools to at least identify engine problems. Prior to the industrial age, the operator set up, ran and maintained the equipment. The industrial revolution introduced specialists, and we redesigned the operator out of maintenance and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You say those are not operator duties? Why not? There are too many answers to that, which when really analyzed, cannot be supported. I cannot defend the indefensible. Rather than look at the &amp;ldquo;why nots,&amp;rdquo; how about looking at the &amp;ldquo;how can we make it happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The German Post developed new maintenance programs for several dozen new plants coming on line. For the preventive maintenance (PM) program, a condition-based computerized checklist would be mainly a column of step numbers and some performance annotations. The technician located the step number on the machine, and beside it were the instructions with pictures and adjustment limits. Essentially, it was a visual factory with the visuals in and on each machine. Operators were qualified to operate a machine based upon proper procedures, an ability to read performance indicators and maintain the material flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, the relationship grew between the operators and technicians to where operators could identify problems and, with the help of the techs, fix them. They also identified PM tasks that they could perform and did. All of this was done without management or operating procedures dictating them to do so. The operator and tech had joint ownership of the equipment. The visuals also helped the supervision to ascertain machine operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In several U.S. postal facilities, this happened in a similar fashion. It was not uncommon to see an operator crawling over a machine. However, when a &amp;ldquo;tie&amp;rdquo; showed up, things reverted quickly. Ties were people from outside the plant. What this did was free up the maintenance staff to work on continuous improvement and help monitor quality. How did management treat this? They indirectly facilitated it happening by providing guidance tied to several conditions, including safety of the employee and not to harm the equipment. Otherwise, they got out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How did this manifest itself in plant performance? It led to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved production and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced unscheduled absences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced grievances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cleaner plant floors and restrooms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors as coaches and resource providers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovations in maintenance programs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lower costs of performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Smiles at the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the late 1950s and 1960s, two terms came of age: work enrichment and work enlargement. These were used when discussing motivation and seen as ways to satisfy the higher needs of employees, as identified by Abraham Maslow. Today, they are considered to have the same meaning, which is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enlarging the work was applied to combining sequential horizontal tasks. Where there were four employees on an assembly, the work was redesigned for two, and some decision-making was incorporated into the work. It involved maybe building four models of the same unit, with the employee making decisions about parts and fit for the unique models from information for which he received training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enriching the work was a vertical enhancement. This involved W. Edwards Deming&amp;rsquo;s assignment of quality responsibility to the person doing the work, building a unit and then connecting it to a different unit using a different skill set, or a multi-skilled technician working on a hydraulic line on the wing of an airplane to allow him to open the skin, reroute electrical, fix the problem and close it all up. I ran into this at the American Airlines maintenance center in Tulsa, Okla., where the unions asked to be trained across craft lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both work enhancements are designed to give the employee some ownership and pride in a completed task where more than their brawn was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may want to consider how work was designed before the industrial age and assembly lines. What happened to the worker during the late 19th century and up to the mid-20th century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The role of Fredrick Taylor in his study of work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The tactics of the robber barons, which reduced the dignity of the worker to nil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The necessary role of the unions and the dignity of the individual&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Laws passed by our government that established rule of engagement for the adversarial relationship of unions and management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How that has affected our production, innovation and creativity into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in the late 1950s, real breakthroughs were made in the subject of motivation and improved dignity for the worker. Acceptance and implementation were (and still are) the issues due to the history of the industrial era mentioned above. Two Americans who had been rejected by their own country introduced redesign of work to the Japanese: Deming with his quality programs and Mary Parker Follet with the concept of the employee being a citizen of the company and what that means in the recognition of dignity and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This fit well into the Japanese concept of space or time. This redesign of the workplace was responsible for the manufacturing excellence after World War II. Deming got them out of the quality hole, and Mary set up the dignity citizenship of the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 1980s, the Japanese experience showed up in the U.S. with total productive maintenance, total quality management, self-directed teams, continuous improvement, kaizen, just-in-time and poka-yoke. All of that was built around the dignity of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that work and learning are integral requirements of our character. They satisfy a spiritual need. We were designed to work and to reap the benefits of accomplishing a task. We need accomplishments and challenges to keep us striving into the future. Work is only part of the life career. We should learn how to design and use it to enhance the other parts. I would hope that this is still a mantra for our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/71xZ9alEIAo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Best Practices for Maintenance Supervisors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I had the privilege of visiting a large pharmaceutical plant in North Carolina several years ago. It was in response to a presentation I had made on just what should supervisors be doing. My organization was undergoing a work sampling on our 2,800 maintenance supervisors to help us get a handle on what they were actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most managers felt that we had burdened the supervisor with too much administrative work and, as a result, kept them from being on the floor interfacing with operations, providing assistance to the craftsperson and evaluating reliability performance. I wondered if our supervisors comprehended the need for face time and what that meant. I personally needed to get a handle on what I was to define as &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were introduced to the plant&amp;rsquo;s maintenance management team and the dayshift maintenance coach. He had a team of 18 facilities craft persons who maintained the building and environmental equipment for a million-square-foot-plus facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He told about his work day. It began with a 15- to 20-minute team meeting in which updates were made on the day&amp;rsquo;s schedule and plant/corporate performance. Employees identified any unusual situations they envisioned, potential problems and lessons from their completed jobs. Time was always allotted for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The coach reviewed operational impacts, what was planned for the next day, unusual activities for the following week and his expectations for the day. That was their only gathering for the day. The team went to work on their assigned preventive and scheduled work orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So far, I found nothing unusual, until I asked him about &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo; What did this consist of? He replied that each team member was an important, unique person and that he spent at least five minutes a day with each of them. If he could, he tried to see each twice during the day. His job was to assure that they had the resources needed to complete their work. If he received a call, he would respond to the work site for face-to-face assistance. Using the daily work schedule and assignments, he worked his way through the plant, interfacing with operations managers/supervisors about scheduling and priorities and some personal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Face time was personal dialogue. It primarily was exchanges about children, sports, work impacts and other seemingly non-process items. Not so unusual, but this was the primary type of dialogue between him and his team members. He knew their goals in life, spouse&amp;rsquo;s and children&amp;rsquo;s names, some of their home issues, what was happening on the Fourth of July or this summer, and other &amp;ldquo;non-work&amp;rdquo; type stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He headed off our questions about &amp;ldquo;work progress,&amp;rdquo; saying that unless he had something pertinent to scheduling or planning, he seldom initiated that dialogue. If the employee wanted to discuss work, the employee started that conversation. The coach&amp;rsquo;s time was spent maintaining interpersonal relationships with his team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His members were the skilled experts, and he felt they wanted the respect that entailed. How did he determine progress against the work order? During their social interaction, he observed what had been accomplished against the PM checklist or planned work order and could pretty well figure the progress. (He had previously reviewed these documents.) If he thought they may be a bit behind and might need help, he could bring up that &amp;ldquo;Joe was ahead today and could come over to provide another set of hands.&amp;rdquo; Otherwise, unless the employee brought up an issue, the coach stayed out of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toward the end of our visit, several team members came to join us. We expressed our appreciation for their coach but wanted their take on his approach to &amp;ldquo;coaching&amp;rdquo; them. To a person, they expressed their gratitude for their &amp;ldquo;boss.&amp;rdquo; They felt needed, respected and trusted. If the coach had asked them how they were doing or if they needed any help, they would have interpreted that as interfering with their responsibilities. The coach was always available to them, if they needed him. They looked forward to his visit each day. They knew him first as a person and second as their coach who represented the company to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Would they take a higher-paying job at the competitor down the road? No way! Did we know that if an employee found a seminar, a conference, a course or a new tool, he was encouraged to pursue it with company money? &amp;ldquo;We have a responsibility to provide the best product we can. We enjoy doing that, and it is more than appreciated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their plant had been evaluated against similar plants on reliability and cost-effectiveness and was considered the maintenance benchmark plant for their company and several of their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now I had an example of &amp;ldquo;face time&amp;rdquo; that represented a best practice. It requires planned floor time with a set agenda. However, it is only possible with a plant-wide mind-set about the empowerment that employees would appreciate, having the pillars of maintenance excellence in place that supports supervisors as well as the team members, and providing the information, training and communication within an atmosphere of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/3iIrBWFhljE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Signs You are in the Real World of Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who has ever done plant maintenance improvement work is inevitably accused at times of just not knowing what it&amp;rsquo;s like in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance. So, here are some of the things I remember from that &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can&amp;rsquo;t ever get on the paging system because it is always tied up with people paging for maintenance help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel have to carry more than one beeper because one is always busy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel really need to work on their responsiveness because they have trouble responding to more than one page at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel are constantly driving by in really fast yellow carts with bright flashing lights and sirens. (Some are actually dressed in blue tights with red capes.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone really supports the planning and scheduling of maintenance work, as long as they can get a one-day turnaround on their work orders.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The only maintenance scheduler who could ever come close to handling the job used to be a short-order cook.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people say, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll get to the PMs sometime, but we&amp;rsquo;ve just got too many repairs to make.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others say, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have time to keep the machines in good condition. We&amp;rsquo;re too busy with projects to modify them to make them work better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people believe voice mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some believe e-mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others believe they are the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The maintenance backlog got to be so big that we made some real money selling it to a lumber company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone agrees that maintenance needs to focus more on strategically supporting the business, but from the discussions, that seems to mean that we need to be able to do emergency repairs faster.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People say we just can&amp;rsquo;t worry about the cost of an emergency repair. It&amp;rsquo;s like Jack Bauer says: &amp;ldquo;Whatever it takes.&amp;rdquo; The time to worry is at month&amp;rsquo;s end, when everyone is really excited about how far you are over budget.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are cab drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts from suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are limo drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts at the airport.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We have a couple of machines that vacationed in Hawaii on frequent-flier miles built up on parts air-shipped in for them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone says it is just so much faster to buy a part than to try to find it in the parts room.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you really need a maintenance mechanic, you can usually find one on the receiving dock waiting for rush parts to show up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At any given time, there are more maintenance people trying to find or buy parts than there are working on machinery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had to expand the parts room so all the people looking for parts could fit in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is no point even considering anyone as a parts supplier who only delivers once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When asked about how maintenance is scheduled, people quote the &amp;ldquo;S*** Happens&amp;rdquo; slogan from the movie &amp;ldquo;Forrest Gump&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We don&amp;rsquo;t bother updating the weekly maintenance schedule since we never get any of the work on it done; it is always good for next week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We discussed whether it was possible that a machine could need so much ongoing maintenance, that it was theoretically never available for production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One of our mechanics works an incredible amount of overtime. We think it may be that he really can&amp;rsquo;t go home anymore, as his attack chihuahua doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People stopped using beepers for maintenance emergencies and went back to the audio paging system because it was too difficult to get that tone of frantic urgency across with more than just a hint of accusation on a beeper.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The police department keeps showing up asking about mechanics who left their homes days ago, telling their families they were just going in for a few hours to help out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our hardware bins are overflowing with really neat nuts, bolts and fittings that we&amp;rsquo;re sure are really useful for something, but we always seem to run out of the ones we actually use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The plant manager put in some low-priority work orders that he told us we could get to when we had time, but the maintenance manager said we better get them all done by noon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our planner is a great mechanic who really helps us find the quickest, best ways to do things, and always makes sure we have everything we need. We get a lot more done because of him, and avoid a lot of lost-time issues we would have otherwise. But managers keep asking why we&amp;rsquo;re wasting such a great mechanic on paperwork when he could be really helping with emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators have come up with a lot of small improvements that they need our help with, but we&amp;rsquo;re told we can&amp;rsquo;t waste our time on them since we really need to stay focused on the big issues, because that&amp;rsquo;s obviously where all the money really is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There was a role clarification meeting between operations and maintenance management, and it seems like the outcome was quite clear. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely their job to break the machines, and our job to fix them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had some informal shared meetings between maintenance and operating folk to discuss current issues and, you know, it was really amazing how many things we actually agreed on as the right thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Use Checklists for a More Efficient Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years, I have spent much time in discussion over the use of checklists for equipment changeovers and startups in plants. I have explained, reasoned, rationalized, cajoled, appealed, beseeched, entreated, implored, pleaded, urged and even cried real tears in my efforts to get people to use checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it was great to see a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found (amazingly) that hospitals using checklists in their operating room procedures suffer a much lower death rate than those that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was glad to see the study, but my very first reaction on reading it was outrage, along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Operating rooms don&amp;rsquo;t routinely use checklists? What?&amp;rdquo; Hopefully, the study will ratchet up awareness and perhaps drive some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But experience has absolutely convinced me that there is something in the human psyche that fights back desperately against using checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We need to get things done quickly. Checklists will slow us down. We know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing; we&amp;rsquo;ve done it a zillion times before.&amp;rdquo; Even with the best intentions in the world, these just are not correct statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, we&amp;rsquo;ve found on packaging lines that any missed item on a changeover checklist cost us at least 10 minutes of lost time on startup. In several cases, it resulted in some significant equipment damage, and who knows how many other times there were damage- or safety-related near-misses. Settings that weren&amp;rsquo;t changed, bolts that weren&amp;rsquo;t tightened, clamps left loose &amp;ndash; all completely unintentional, done by people who had done it many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human memory just isn&amp;rsquo;t reliable enough, especially if interrupted to briefly do something else &amp;hellip; or perhaps someone has a question or needs a hand momentarily. Once the mind has changed focus, all bets are off on memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A weakening memory in our culture seems to be treated as a real indicator of diminished capability, a sign of oncoming senility, the dreaded &amp;ldquo;senior moments.&amp;rdquo; But human memory isn&amp;rsquo;t a reliable mechanism at any age. We all forget our keys or where we left them or &amp;ldquo;what did I come into this room to get?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen even the smartest, most capable people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with forget things when distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can understand why surgeons, renowned for the magnitude of their egos, would resist anything that seems to suggest a compensation for a failing capability. But why then have airline pilots (with at least comparable egos) accepted checklists for many years. (Well, yes, the regulations say they have to, but if you talk to them, they say they just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even think of operating without them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mike Thomas, an associate who was a Navy pilot and then a long-time trainer of Navy and airline pilots, explains it as just a part of flying. From their very first exposure to airplanes, pilots work from checklists, and a key part of the trainer&amp;rsquo;s job is training in how to use checklists, just as much as training in the actual functions of the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly in plants, we&amp;rsquo;ve found when individuals are trained to perform tasks using checklists, they tend to continue using them. The difficulty comes when someone has been routinely performing a task before the checklist is developed. Even if they help develop the checklist, it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult for them to begin using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, we always get the argument that for pilots it&amp;rsquo;s a life-and-death situation (surgeons, too), and the same rigorous practices are just not necessary (and not affordable) in industry. Yet, when we started using checklists, things always got better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The simple answer then is just to make it a requirement for people to use checklists, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t, then there are consequences. But if you absolutely insist that people turn in completed checklists, then you&amp;rsquo;ll absolutely get completed checklists, because that&amp;rsquo;s what you asked for. Nothing says the checklist was actually used like it should have been. Unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s the story behind much reported checklist use. The requirement was a completed checklist, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have looked in many files and seen many pristine checklists and preventive maintenance (PM) work orders without any fingerprints, smudges or stains, and wondered how people could manage to keep them that clean out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Americans historically are not good at mindless obedience, but we are quite excellent at mindful disobedience, particularly when someone tries to force us to do something for which we don&amp;rsquo;t hold much value. That&amp;rsquo;s the way people in this country are typically wired, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s becoming the case in most other countries these days. We always push the limits, and we don&amp;rsquo;t take much for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(You know just one thing wrong on that checklist, even a typo, negates completely the value of the entire thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also had to talk about different ways to use checklists. If someone has performed a task countless times, it&amp;rsquo;s not very efficient for them to go step by step through a detailed listing, checking off each item as they do it. In that case, it&amp;rsquo;s OK to perform a small group of related tasks and then check them off. But it is never OK to perform all the tasks and then check them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have counseled people, &amp;ldquo;Why do you want to stress yourself, taking the risk of forgetting something? Why even try to remember? Use the checklist.&amp;rdquo; This is all about getting equipment started up and running well, as fast as possible, not completing mental improvement exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who deserves more respect &amp;ndash; the person who uses the checklist, completes the changeover perfectly and the equipment starts up and just runs, or the person who manages to do almost all those steps completely from memory and then we burn time trying to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to win trivia games at home, maybe even compete on Jeopardy or otherwise exhibit incredible memory prowess, that&amp;rsquo;s great, but memory gymnastic demonstrations don&amp;rsquo;t help us with more effective, efficient equipment changeovers or startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a plant where the qualification requirement for operating a piece of equipment was to be able to change it over completely from memory. This was a big piece of equipment with way more than 100 steps in the procedure. I got blank stares when I asked why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, what actually works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The use of checklists has to be mandatory, beyond debate. Just like safety glasses, ear protection, lockout safety, etc., they&amp;rsquo;re part of the job. But it takes much more than law-and-order enforcement to get successful ongoing use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to work with people and train them to do the job using the lists. Then it&amp;rsquo;s a routine, essential part of the process, and they get over the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s something extra, that it&amp;rsquo;s slowing them down.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to actually be out there, making sure that everyone has his or her checklist and is really using it, and finding any issues with the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We found laminated plastic checklists and grease pencils worked best.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Changeover follow-up meetings can help determine where people are struggling with the checklists. Identify time loss due to improper use. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for improvement, not blame. Blame tends to get you back again to mindful disobedience.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You must have active, participative processes to continuously improve changeovers and startups that include keeping the checklists current and building ongoing ownership for them. It&amp;rsquo;s always amazing how ownership makes the whole process just so much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This means constant work for team leaders, supervisors and managers, but it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of their job. Most importantly, they themselves really have to believe that using checklists is the most effective, efficient approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Improve Performance with Automated Welding</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/3/8/3e1d8713-ec89-42d8-9c96-f9ed50d36e06_Welding Robot 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 450px; float: left;" /&gt;When you invest in automation, the goal is to gain productivity and quality improvements that set your welding operation apart from the competition and help increase your bottom line. To achieve success with an automated welding system, however, you need to ensure that the parts you are welding are consistent and repeatable, to confirm that your welding operation has good workflow and to have properly trained welding operators to oversee the system. You also need the right equipment for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to working with a reliable robotic integrator to select and implement the robot, you should also take care to select the right robotic MIG gun and consumables &amp;mdash; contact tips, nozzles, liners and retaining heads &amp;mdash; for the application. The consumables, in particular, are an easily overlooked part of an automated welding system, but they can have a measurable impact on downtime and day-to-day costs. Consider these suggestions for getting the best performance from these components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Extensions and Connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The contact-tip-to-nozzle relationship for an automated welding system varies according to the application, but it still has an impact on the welding performance and quality you achieve. Applications that have complex joints or tooling often require an extended contact-tip-to-nozzle relationship. This relationship provides greater access into more complex joints and can help you better accommodate for complex tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should be mindful that this relationship also makes your contact tip more prone to spatter accumulation and may reduce the tip life due to it being more exposed to the heat of the arc. The application of an anti-spatter compound can offer some protection against such situations, but you will also need to monitor your contact tips regularly for signs of wear. Remember, preventive maintenance is better than downtime for resolving problems. Change over your contact tips before issues occur.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using heavy-duty or extended-duty contact tips composed of chrome zirconium is also a good option for gaining longer performance. Chrome zirconium contact tips are harder and more durable than copper ones, and while they offer slightly less conductivity, the difference is negligible. Typically, you can identify these types of contact tips by the machined groove at the base of the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Checking your contact tips, retaining heads (or diffusers) and nozzles for good connections can also have a measurable impact on your welding performance. Solid connections help ensure reliable electrical conductivity and minimize heat, which in turn provides more consistent weld quality and helps your consumables last longer. Look for consumables that are designed to thread together and mate securely, too, as these can further increase their longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Wires and Contact Tip Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The welding wires you use can impact the performance of your contact tips and can also affect what size you should select. Larger drums of wires &amp;mdash; 500 to 1,000 pounds &amp;mdash; are commonly employed for automated welding systems to minimize changeover. However, the wire in these drums tends to have less of a cast and/or helix than wire that feeds off a smaller spool. As a result, the wire often feeds through the contact tip relatively straight, making little or no contact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The effect is twofold. First, it minimizes the electrical conductivity necessary to create a good arc and a sound weld. Second, it can cause the welding wire to contact the part being welded and arc back into the contact tip, thereby creating a burnback. This condition automatically creates downtime to change over the contact tip. As a solution, consider undersizing your contact tips, particularly if you are using a solid wire. For example, a .040-inch (1 mm) diameter contact tip could work for a .045-inch wire. Check with a trusted robotic integrator or welding distributor if you are using metal-cored wires, as undersizing them is not always feasible due to their tubular construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should also consider the impact that the wire you are using has on the longevity of your contact tip. For example, non-copper-coated solid wires tend to wear contact tips (and liners) more quickly than copper-coated ones. The copper on a copper-coated wire acts like a lubricant to improve feedability and can often extend consumable life. It may be worthwhile to factor in the higher upfront cost of these wires compared to the increased cost of purchasing more contact tips for use with a non-copper-coated wire, as well as the downtime for changeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Welding Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automated welding systems require consumables that are capable of withstanding longer periods of welding &amp;mdash; and most often higher amperages &amp;mdash; than a semi-automatic application. The specific mode of transfer for gas metal arc welding (GMAW) or metal inert gas (MIG) welding you use can also impact the type of consumables you require. For example, pulsed welding programs in which the power source &amp;ldquo;pulses&amp;rdquo; between low background currents and high peaks are especially harsh on consumables due to the higher levels of heat that the process generates. They tend to cause the contact tip to erode more quickly and therefore require more frequent changeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should carefully monitor your contact tip usage if using such a welding program so that you can determine how often the contact tips need to be replaced. Changing over these consumables before they experience problems can help prevent issues like loss of electrical conductivity, burnbacks or excessive spatter accumulation, the latter of which tends to occur when the contact tip becomes too hot and the consumable material softens. Use the time during routine pauses in production for contact tip changeover to avoid interrupting arc-on time. You should also consider using heavy-duty contact tips for higher heat applications. Again, contact tips made of chrome zirconium are a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Selecting and Maintaining the Right Nozzle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, the tooling on your automated welding system dictates the type of nozzle that you will need to use. Bottleneck, straight or tapered nozzles are common choices since they are narrower than standard nozzles and can provide better access around tooling or into complex joints. Still, always consider the duty cycle and amperage of your application when deciding which nozzle to use. The more tapered a nozzle, typically the thinner it is and the less able it is to withstand higher amperage or higher-duty cycle applications. If your automated welding system welds at higher amperages (300 amps or greater) and has high levels of arc-on time, it may be a good idea to select a heavy-duty style since these have thicker walls and insulators and are more able to resist heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nozzles composed of copper are also a good option, as are those featuring high-temperature fiberglass insulators. Work with your robotic integrator or welding distributor to make the right nozzle selection. Remember that you need to be sure to select one that provides access to the joint but that is not so narrow (especially in relation to the contact tip) that you compromise shielding gas coverage or unnecessarily shorten the consumables&amp;rsquo; life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For all styles and types of nozzles, it is recommended that you employ a nozzle-cleaning station or reamer to help maintain them. A nozzle-cleaning station cleans the robotic gun and nozzle of spatter and clears away debris in the retaining head that accumulates during the welding process. These stations can also be outfitted with a sprayer that applies a water- or oil-based anti-spatter compound to protect the nozzle, retaining head and workpiece from spatter after it has been cleaned. The nozzle-cleaning station should be placed close to your robot so it is easily accessible. Also, you should program your robot to use it in between cycles &amp;mdash; during part loading or tool transfer &amp;mdash; so as not to interrupt your welding operation. It should only take a few seconds for the nozzle-cleaning station to complete its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a general rule, it is best to select consumables that are well-machined and have smooth, round surfaces, as these are less prone to collecting spatter and tend to last longer. It is also important that you use the heaviest-duty consumables for your application that will still allow access to tooling. Doing so can help extend their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that you also need to pay attention to your retaining head selection and the liners that you use in your robotic MIG gun. The retaining head should match your nozzle and contact tip appropriately and offer a secure connection so that you obtain the best conductivity. Also, always trim and install liners according to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, using a liner gauge to determine the appropriate length. A liner that is too short or too long can cause wire-feeding problems that require downtime to rectify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As with any part of an automated welding system, the goal is to keep your consumables in working order so that you spend more time reaping the benefits of the process and less time troubleshooting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>3 Ways to Achieve Successful Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is important to every manufacturing operation. Successful reliability requires communication, cooperation and coordination. To learn the importance of these three Cs, let&amp;rsquo;s examine how your organization is structured and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much does unscheduled downtime cost and where does the responsibility for that unscheduled downtime lie? Is the unscheduled downtime because someone unilaterally decided to run to failure, or is it because the work request was in the &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; but not responded to in a timely fashion to preclude the unscheduled downtime caused by an unscheduled failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a competent operator know when there is an anomaly with the equipment? Since a good operator is a living, breathing data-acquisition machine, the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; In the state of normal operation, good operators are cognizant of anomalies in the equipment they operate approximately one-fourth of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A follow-up question that progressive, reliability-focused management should be asking is: &amp;ldquo;What is preventing the competent operator from communicating the impending failures of the equipment to the &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; early enough to develop good job plans, identify the needed materials and resources, and schedule the repair in a timeframe that reduces unscheduled, expensive downtime and instead allows a quality repair to be done at a time that minimally impacts productivity?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a craft-qualified, ethical maintenance tech have a desire to leave his name on a less-than-quality repair? As with the competent operator, the answer to this question is another resounding statement, &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; Just as the competent operator wants to be known for producing a quality product at the desired rate, a qualified maintenance tech desires to leave his name on a quality repair that will not fail and be classified as a &amp;ldquo;maintenance-induced failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This leads to another follow-up question that management should be asking: &amp;ldquo;What is causing less-than-quality repairs?&amp;rdquo; Do the materials management personnel, storeroom attendants and purchasing buyers feel frustrated because the management-designed &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; allows them to be the scapegoat for obviously controllable, but voluntarily uncontrolled product loss due to unscheduled downtime? Yes. You either voluntarily control downtime or voluntarily allow it to happen in an uncontrolled manner. The controlled or uncontrolled downtime is in the system that management has developed or allowed to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is management&amp;rsquo;s mindset regarding efficiency and effectiveness? For example, take a NASCAR pit stop. Which is more effective and efficient &amp;ndash; a pit stop that is scheduled, albeit in a short timeframe, or one that just happens somewhere on the oval track? It may seem like a rather inane question, but consider what you allow to happen routinely in your production-centric environment. Do you try to milk the last bit out of your system, ignoring the fact that well-maintained equipment is much more reliable and productive than ill-maintained equipment? Perhaps you are merely hoping that your stock car will get seven more laps on those bald tires and that the telemetry data on fuel usage is inaccurate. If the tires don&amp;rsquo;t make the seven laps or the fuel telemetry is accurate, you may end up with zero points in the standings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Are your customers happy with getting the product that they contracted for, within specific parameters, delivered in a haphazard manner and time frame? You probably don&amp;rsquo;t accept transactions that way in your personal life. You expect the terms and conditions of the agreement to be met. The clients that purchase your company&amp;rsquo;s products expect the same fulfillment of their contracted expectations. If these expectations are not met for your customer, they will find another supplier because it is a competitive marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is the answer. Just as you expect your vehicle to start when you put the key into the ignition and turn it, so you have the same expectations with your manufacturing equipment. A major difference between your personal vehicle and manufacturing assets is that your personal vehicle is probably only driven by you, whereas the manufacturing equipment is operated by a succession of qualified people. This takes us back to the importance of the &amp;ldquo;system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How is your system designed? Are the communication, cooperation and coordination between the support pillars of your organization functional? In assessing how well your plant stacks up on the three Cs, start by answering some fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being identified while they are small and not affecting the quality and quantity of your product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being addressed in a manner that minimizes adverse effects on equipment uptime?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a mutual acceptance of responsibility and ownership between the operation function and the maintenance function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operations should do an excellent job in making the product, while maintenance should provide quality and timely preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM) and a well-managed and functional inventory in the storeroom, which is under maintenance control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both operations and maintenance must form a viable partnership of communication, cooperation and coordination of activities to ensure timely repair of identified malfunctions before minor malfunctions become catastrophic and affect productivity. There must be a realistic business case decision to manage between the short-term and long-term gain. You must be willing to take a short production loss now, in a controlled manner, scheduled at a time that minimizes the effect on productivity, rather than wait and take a longer, more devastating hit on productivity at a later date because you have chosen the uncontrolled path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be on a proactive, world-class path requires organizational functions to be mutually supportive, to communicate needs and observations, and to coordinate the effort, time, resources and knowledge necessary for mutual success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Get More Maintenance Work Done with Proper Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Famous financier Bernard Baruch was often quoted as saying, &amp;ldquo;Two and two still and always will equal four.&amp;rdquo; This, some would say, quaint concept has fallen out of favor more and more in recent years, as clearly the restrictiveness of basic arithmetic is not something that should continue to bind us in today&amp;rsquo;s brave new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s much more useful if two and two can equal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever analysts are expecting it to be (or better).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever your boss wants it to be.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever will make this current project justifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping this in mind, some odd-looking math that actually works in plant maintenance is the rule that:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This rule is a huge help with another rule that is always pretty much true:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In most plants, there are never enough maintenance people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I have 10 maintenance mechanics and the backlog just keeps growing, how can you get more maintenance work done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hiring more people is usually a long and difficult process, and always the longest, most difficult part is getting the approval (usually, rightly so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contractors are an option and will definitely get the work done (and usually best for specialized tasks), but they can eat up the budget pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overtime eats budgets, too, and also burns people out after not too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can also just beat on everyone to get more done, but that becomes counterproductive fairly quickly. Plus, since you&amp;rsquo;re typically working in a broken process to begin with, how much more can you really get done? Work ethic (except in a small number of cases) isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem. However, frustration can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or, you can just live (or try to), as many do, with the anxiety, excitement, frustration and consequences of not getting done what really needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But suppose you take your best, most organized mechanic and put him in a planning role, charging him and the group with using him solely as a resource to work with them to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the best, quickest way of doing a job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify materials, tools, etc., needed to do that job in the best way. This way, they can be prepped ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work with the supervisor (or scheduler) to build a schedule based on realistic resource times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This way, you get more done with the people you have just by not wasting their time. (Believe it or not, the majority of people actually like this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, many times the response to this proposal is a variety of colorful expressions, all unflattering and casting unkind doubt about various attributes and the heredity of the proposer. Milder ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;How can we afford to give up a mechanic to become a planner? There&amp;rsquo;s just too much work to get done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;You want us to take our best mechanic out of the workforce and have him do paperwork? Are you nuts?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But numbers that various reputable surveys have pulled together over the years typically and consistently show that the usual unplanned maintenance work setup results in an actual working time (or so-called wrench-turning time) of about 35 percent of the available time of mechanics. The rest of the time is spent in many other ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Traveling to and from the job site and various other places (maintenance shop, parts room, lunchroom, washroom, receiving dock, supervisor&amp;rsquo;s office, engineer&amp;rsquo;s office, production manager&amp;rsquo;s office, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waiting for equipment to become available (behind schedule because of an earlier breakdown)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determining how to do the job and what materials, etc., are needed (traveling to all those places above and consulting with them)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting materials (after you find them; if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then you have to go through your determining process again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting tools (unless someone else is using them or didn&amp;rsquo;t put them back, then you have a finding process)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting help when needed (traveling and consulting again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tool cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same surveys typically show that on a well-planned, scheduled basis, actual working time rises to about 65 percent of the available time with all the non-working time components being significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So if you convert one mechanic out of your 10 to a planner, you have nine mechanics working at 65 percent vs. the previous 35 percent. Thus, effectively you now have 16.5 of your current 35 percent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You just added 6.5 mechanics by moving to planned and scheduled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5&amp;Prime;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;Buy 1 and get 6.5 free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on this, how can you afford not to commit to a planner? Some would say, &amp;ldquo;Most of our work is emergency work anyway with no time for planning, so how can a planner help?&amp;rdquo; Well, the key is just to start.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There has to be some work being done in scheduled downtime, where there is some time for planning. Start with that. If you start to get the scheduled repair work done much faster and better (or even just close to the time you estimated) in the scheduled downtime, then amazingly you start to be able to get the preventive maintenance work done in the scheduled downtime rather than skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without PM inspections, there is no hope of getting away from a lot of emergency work. But with them, there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspections generate work orders for more non-immediate repair work that can be planned and scheduled &amp;mdash; work that you actually get done (and done right). Emergency work &amp;mdash; the most inefficient use of resources &amp;mdash; begins to go down. You then begin to start a cycle of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many other good things start to happen, too &amp;mdash; a major one being that you begin to get more credibility. That opens a lot of doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, dramatic reduction doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight. There is individual and group training, developing the process, getting acceptance and commitment to get the process going, and some system setup. But it does begin to have an effect very quickly. Just start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK. So you don&amp;rsquo;t get all of your additional mechanics right away, but you start to get some. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get the planning and scheduling system good enough to get them all, you&amp;rsquo;re still well ahead of where you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment I always heard after a planning system was in place was, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting a lot more work done.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Share the Responsibility for PM Attainment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance (PM) is a cornerstone of reliability-based maintenance. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise then that PM attainment has become a key performance indicator (KPI). However, it may surprise you that in many organizations, maintenance is not primarily responsible for this KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance always has an important role, of course. It must create the PM program. It must generate, schedule and plan PMs. It also must have staff with enough skill to accomplish the PM. If maintenance is missing any of these things, it has a lot of work to do. But if PM attainment is already one of your current KPIs, these steps are probably already being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet if those planned PMs are not being accomplished, there is another likely reason besides maintenance capability. The most common reason for scheduled PMs not being accomplished is a change in the production schedule removing access to equipment and lines that were scheduled for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This doesn&amp;rsquo;t absolve maintenance for missing PM due to other reasons. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the material, people or tools on hand or has poorly estimated the necessary work, maintenance should be accountable. However, big blocks of PM tasks are often missed due to a change in the production schedule. This usually is not in the control of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason the schedule changes is often due to a short-term need for more production, frequently while there are complaints about the machinery not running well enough. Yet even when the reason for extending the production schedule is to overcome maintenance downtime, the stage has been set for even more downtime to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To hold me responsible for a KPI, I should have the means to control it. If I am the maintenance manager, I rarely control the production schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I like using PM attainment as a metric, my suggestion is for it to be a shared metric among both the production manager and maintenance manager (as well as the production planning staff, if you have one). They should all be held accountable if scheduled PM tasks are not being performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/nmCFUBQV3e8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Achieve Effective Maintenance Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As Sisyphus well knew, pushing things up mountains is difficult, and the uphill struggle from the reactive to the proactive maintenance world is often a frustrating &amp;ldquo;three steps forward, two steps back&amp;rdquo; process. That&amp;rsquo;s a major reason why so many slide back into the familiar, ugly, day-to-day, survival morass at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of those steps on the way up is where preventive maintenance inspections are getting done, we&amp;rsquo;re finding things that need to be fixed and we&amp;rsquo;re fixing them. However, we&amp;rsquo;re still not getting that much better. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fixing the same things over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The famous quote, &amp;ldquo;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it,&amp;rdquo; remains as true as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, the &amp;ldquo;find it, fix it and move on&amp;rdquo; mode is a big step up from the &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look or feel like great improvement, so many get discouraged and tend to look for faster, more rewarding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the maintenance planner can really make a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An item I emphasize in maintenance planning and scheduling classes is the importance of the planner. One of the planner&amp;rsquo;s first activities on the job is to check to see if we&amp;rsquo;ve done this work before on this or similar equipment. If we can get the planning information from previous work (even copy the work order), a huge amount of the planner&amp;rsquo;s time is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement for planner productivity and accuracy, but what&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for maintenance and operational improvement is that now the planner is looking at the number of times the same work has been done before. This tends to raise the questions of why and what can we do about it. That way, we don&amp;rsquo;t just keep making that same repair over and over again. We get folks together and work on it. Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s an operational or equipment care gap that we can fix pretty quickly. Now, we really start to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a case of a motor that kept burning out every six months or so. It was a small motor, and someone different was always making the fix on a different shift. It was a pretty quick replacement, so it took a while to get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sprocket had been replaced on an emergency repair, and since the right one wasn&amp;rsquo;t in stock, the closest one was substituted. No follow-up work order was written to make the right replacement. The motor was overloaded, but not tremendously, so it took a while to die. Of course, it seemed that we were always replacing small motors anyway. Therefore, why would this one stand out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if you search for that work in a CMMS system, the list of occurrences jumps up right away, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious we need to ask why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big issues in plants are usually well-known and as a result have a somewhat reasonable chance of getting attention. But the planner is really the only one looking at all the repairs and is likely to see patterns in the smaller ones. Routinely finding and fixing small items is a key indicator of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, using history requires a few things, the biggest of which is a value for using history. As a society, we&amp;rsquo;d rather jump in and just do it and not &amp;ldquo;waste time&amp;rdquo; researching because &amp;ldquo;this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different.&amp;rdquo; So managers need to encourage planners to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, there&amp;rsquo;s concern that if we don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, we&amp;rsquo;ve wasted that research time. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long. Besides, we&amp;rsquo;re learning what information needs to be there and can fix work orders that aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quality of the information is key. The 60- or 80-character work description is the most significant information seen when a work order listing is pulled up. Therefore, that needs to tell the story clearly. A work request description often states an issue, but the final description should describe the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Something else I recommend is routinely visiting completed work orders to make sure all useful information is captured. Unfortunately, completing paperwork does not have the same value for all personnel, and everyone does not know or understand the use and significance of the various work order fields. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s always useful to actually talk to mechanics to find out how things went and what could have been better in the plan. That&amp;rsquo;s how we get better at planning, too. Effective planning is always a team activity.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/31/c35d4bbe-c836-4011-b436-f9bc32ec68dc_sisyphus.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;I stumbled across some music trivia lately, that the old rock band Chicago finally had its album &amp;ldquo;Stone of Sisyphus&amp;rdquo; released a few years ago. One of the more famous &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; albums, it was originally recorded in the early 1990s but had languished for years, available only in illegal bootleg copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That reminded me of when I used to use the story of Sisyphus in maintenance training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I never encountered a great number of serious Greek mythology students in those sessions, but was always amazed how mythology suddenly grasped attendees&amp;rsquo; attention when I started telling about Sisyphus showing up in an episode of the TV series &amp;ldquo;Xena: Warrior Princess.&amp;rdquo; A statuesque, obviously very strong gal who always wore a brief, Roman-style leather outfit, Xena had a pretty fair following back in those days, especially it seemed in the typical plant maintenance group. (It was often brought up that the whole educational experience would have been much enhanced with video clips.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was a Greek king who made the mistake of getting the Greek god Zeus really ticked off at him. He supposedly did this by leaking stories to the press of that time about some of Zeus&amp;rsquo; indiscretions. So Sisyphus was sentenced to spend the rest of eternity &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; every day, all day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; laboriously pushing a huge boulder up a mountain. Then in the evening, he was to stand aside and watch it roll all the way back down to the bottom. Then the next day, he was to start all over again, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; summer, winter, rain, snow, hot, cold, no vacation, no sick days, not even Christmas (obviously) or New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was pretty much a piece of work who had pulled off some pretty bad stuff himself, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really work up much sympathy for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So Sisyphus is still at it, somewhere out there, I guess, but you know he&amp;rsquo;s not alone. Keeping maintenance in a proactive mode can be a very similar pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we start out trying to get out of the frenetic &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, getting preventive maintenance inspections going, getting maintenance planning and scheduling going &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; that feels a lot like pushing a boulder up a mountain. (Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s probably harder. Sisyphus didn&amp;rsquo;t have people pushing back on the boulder as he was pushing it up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But as PM inspections get better and better, and people become more routinely conscious of equipment condition and get potential problems dealt with, and emergency work falls off, and we are getting better and better scheduled repairs done, the slope becomes gentler and it is easier to push the boulder. And the higher we get, the easier it is to push, and the air gets clearer, the sky gets bluer, the sun shines, the birds sing, the flowers bloom, we can see for miles, and maybe even Julie Andrews is running around up here singing something about the &amp;ldquo;Sound of Music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a while and some serious effort, we start to get where things start to run more smoothly. We can count on steady, decent production numbers every day. We don&amp;rsquo;t have aggravating breakdowns. We don&amp;rsquo;t have that routine, yet always unexpected, excess overtime that messes up people&amp;rsquo;s lives. (I remember the days of really hoping to make it through Friday without a disaster so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to ruin some people&amp;rsquo;s, and my own, weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we do planned repair work, we have pretty much everything ready, so it goes well and we get done what we had planned, pretty much how we planned it. We have a process in place where operations and maintenance folks routinely identify and analyze our problems and make permanent fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, it becomes really tempting to try to walk away from the boulder, because you know, it looks like maybe it will stay there by itself. It seems pretty secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe now we can start skipping some PMs. Maybe we can pull our maintenance planner for some other work. Maybe we can use our &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; maintenance resources for that project we can&amp;rsquo;t quite justify otherwise. Maybe maintenance doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to come to the production meetings anymore (there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many people showing up there now anyway). Maybe we just don&amp;rsquo;t need to demonstrate that much commitment to routine maintenance anymore. It seems to be pretty much a non-issue now, and there are other more exciting and visible things to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, guess what happens as soon as we stop pushing on the boulder? You bet. That son of a gun starts rolling backward &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; slowly at first, then faster and faster and faster, then bounding and smashing its way down the mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s headed all the way down to the bottom, and the trip down is a whole lot quicker than the trip up. You have to be really brave or really dumb to get in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we ever stop pushing to keep maintenance proactive, we will be back down and dirty in the reactive mode before we know it&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;back down in the dark, cold, slimy, muddy gulch at the bottom, where all kinds of nasty, obnoxious creatures are hissing and snarling and biting at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now down here it takes way more resources, time, money, blood, sweat and tears just to get through (just to survive) the day. We were starting to have it made when we were at the top. Comparatively, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking that much to stay there, but we just didn&amp;rsquo;t realize what we had, and what it took to stay there. We took it for granted and we lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now we have to start over, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be tougher this time because now we have a serious credibility issue. Will we be like Sisyphus again this time?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Set Frequencies for PM Inspections</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For those of you who want to indulge in the details of setting preventive maintenance (PM) inspections, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with defining what I mean by inspections. Inspections include all objective inspections (we measure something) using an instrument &amp;ndash; for example, a vibration analyzer, an infrared camera, a volt meter, a flow meter or ultrasonic equipment. Inspections also include all subjective inspections (look-listen-feel-smell). In order to set inspection frequencies, we need to understand what a failure-developing period is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The failure-developing period (FDP), also called the Pf Curve by some, is the time period from when it is possible to detect a failure until we have a breakdown. A failure is when a system or piece of equipment is operating correctly within given parameters, but it shows signs of problems. For example, a centrifugal pump may be cavitating, but it is still providing the required flow for the operation. We have a failure but not a breakdown. The cavitation in our example will eventually develop into a breakdown. The breakdown occurs when the pump is unable to perform its intended function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The FDP is the time difference between the failure and the breakdown. If the pump started to cavitate at 6 a.m. and it broke down at 6 p.m. four days later, the FDP is 108 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Inspection Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inspection frequency should roughly be FDP divided by two. For example, if the failure-developing period is 14 days and we need some time to plan and schedule the corrective maintenance for that failure, I think a reasonable inspection frequency is seven days (FDP/2). If the inspection frequency is longer than 14 days, we may miss the failure and will have a breakdown on our hands. So our rule of thumb is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;Inspection frequency = FDP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, the real problem is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know what the FDP is. There is no standard, no documentation. Most plants usually have no history on FDP. So what do you do? Let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper with some additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Inspection Tools Change the FDP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also need to understand that the FDP changes when we have access to better tools. For example, we may be able to detect a problem with a pillow block bearing by listening to it by putting a screwdriver to our ear (and the bearing). This method may give us a warning period of a few days (on average, depending on situation). However, if we buy a vibration analyzer, we can probably detect the same failure at least six weeks in advance. The failure is the same, but the FDP has changed. For the most part, the only reason we buy inspection tools is to extend the FDP with accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In reality, the ability to detect a failure and the FDP also depends on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the person&amp;rsquo;s ability to do the inspection;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the environment (lighting, temperature, indoor vs. outdoor, etc);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		operational parameters at the time of inspection;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		equipment design and accessibility;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Many Variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each component has many failure modes, and each failure mode has different FDPs. We also know that each FDP may change depending on the inspection tool, technique, the person doing the inspection and more. On top of all this, each component is running at different speeds, different loads and&amp;nbsp;in a different environment. Everything is different. Now we are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point of reasoning, many plants go the wrong way, in my opinion. Some plants make the conclusion that a massive study needs to be done in order to find the answers to all of these questions. Why is this not a good approach? It is not because in 999 times out of 1,000 you will not have the data you need to do the analysis. Even if you did, the best bang for the buck is usually to get your people trained and then out there doing inspections rather than performing a big analysis. What you will end up with when you do a complicated analysis without data is a wild, somewhat educated guess with a lot of work. So let&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;not do the complicated analysis and instead do a wild, somewhat educated guess using our experience and cut out 99.9 percent of the work? Does that sound good to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Wild, Somewhat Educated Guess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some typical problems with an AC motor. This is far from all failure modes. For example, if you look at the SKF manual, a bearing has more than 50 failure modes. Therefore, we need to look at the common problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example: AC motor, 125 horsepower, 80 percent load, 24/7 operation, dusty environment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/3/e7d81d0f-7bfa-45ed-bdbd-add1614a91b7_a-pm-frequency-table1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 500px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned above, there are many more failure modes. I have picked some common problems to illustrate my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we look at the right column, there are many different inspection frequencies, even when we do a simplified analysis. Our estimates are just guesswork and will vary as a result of who is doing the inspection, the type of tool and the environment, so we should not take the numbers too seriously; they are estimates. I would, therefore, look at some of the shorter inspection intervals and then add some of the longer-interval inspections to those since we may as well do the longer ones when we are there. They don&amp;rsquo;t take too long to do, and we are just guessing on the intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I look at this AC motor, I would group them as follows in a typical process plant environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/3/7fd9bdfc-dd7b-40f7-abbc-36c98eda65e2_pm-frequency-table2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 214px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Other Inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If it is a critical motor, perhaps you want to do a full motor analysis or a simple leakage to ground. I have yet to have a vendor be able to explain what the estimated FDP is using their tools for the above inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Common Logical Error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspection frequencies are based on FDP, not life of component, nor the criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The life of a component has nothing to do with inspection frequency. For example, a world-class plant may have an average motor life of 18 years. Some motors last eight years and some 25. However, the FDP for these motors are most likely in the one- to four-week span, so life statistics have nothing to do with inspection frequency. A common erroneous argument is &amp;ldquo;we have inspected this component for three years and have not found any problems. Therefore, we extend the inspection frequency from one week to two weeks.&amp;rdquo; The fact that you have not found a problem has nothing to do with the FDP. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed just because the component is running well. Once that component fails, it may be after 15 years, the FDP may still be two weeks and you need to catch it. If you change the inspection period to two weeks, there is roughly a 50 percent risk that you will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Criticality does not affect the FDP but is practically a factor when we assign inspection frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our AC motor bearings are equally critical to our foundation for the operation of the motor. If either fails, the motor stops. However, the FDP and the inspection frequency are different because we base the inspection frequency on the FDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The criticality of the motor may change the selection of the inspection frequency because we are uncertain of the FDP. The FDP is a guess. So a very critical component may be checked more frequently because we don&amp;rsquo;t really know the FDP. It is an insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspection frequencies are based on FDP, not criticality or component life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The FDP is pretty much impossible to predict. However, we can make a pretty good guess to what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you don&amp;rsquo;t have very good historical data as to what the FDP is, don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time making a big study. Make a reasonable guess. It is what you will end up with anyway with a study without data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you have the FDP data, ask if it isn&amp;rsquo;t better to spend the effort in training people in doing inspections and planning and scheduling of corrective actions instead of making a large FDP study. Most of the time, it is better to spend the time on execution.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Quick Guide to PM Development and Execution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In many organizations, groups are often trying to chase the latest buzzwords of the day and yet have never established the foundation required to support those efforts. PM development and execution are classic examples. For this discussion, when I refer to PMs, I am talking about both preventive maintenance and condition-based maintenance tasks. This is by no means an exhaustive explanation of all of the considerations necessary for a comprehensive PM program. It is intended as a rough guide to foster continued discussion into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stop doing non-value added PMs or task steps within the PM. We can never seem to find time to update or correct the PM tasks or frequencies but can always find time to continue doing the wrong work (go figure! ).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assuming that you already have a PM program in place, start with the equipment where you are bleeding or hemorrhaging the most. This is often not your most critical assets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the failure modes of the equipment. The blowout preventer in the Gulf oil spill had more than 260. Per the SKF manual, a bearing has more than 50 failure modes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the Reliability-Centered Maintenance Logic Tree to determine the tasks. Use condition-based monitoring (CBM) techniques where possible first because it&amp;rsquo;s less expensive, especially compared to an overhaul. Yes, some groups still do overhaul maintenance for no other reason than they have done it that way for the last 20 years. Your equipment actually defines the type of PM, as not everything lends itself to predictive technologies, as an example. Run to failure is an option, provided you can limit the collateral damage. CBM often extends or widens the failure detection window over time-based activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define tasks that allow you to find the equipment in the act of failure with respect to each of the failure modes. Failure modes and effects analysis is a great tool for these items, but many groups can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the time to perform them in developing their procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create the procedures using standard text.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Focus on precision maintenance to a specification (i.e. torque values, belt tension).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure to look for hidden failures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set the frequency of the task based on experience and history, if you have it. Generally, in very broad terms, it should be one half the width of the failure detection window. Keep in mind that you need time to effectively plan and schedule the equipment restoration in a proactive manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspect and audit the work processes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure the outcome and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solicit feedback from the crafts performing the PM tasks by adding a continuous improvement loop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Great procedures are a start, but recognize that you may need to focus on changing the behaviors of the people who are doing the work. The behaviors may be as much as 80 percent of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish partnerships with the other stakeholders such as production and engineering. As an example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do the PM when production doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you access to the equipment. No matter how well you maintain it, if the equipment is not operated correctly, no level of maintenance can keep it running. If engineering bought the least cost equipment and installed it with poor methods, you most likely can&amp;rsquo;t overcome that either. Realize the total life cycle costs (LCC) may be upward of 20 times the initial installed cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When you have a failure, you should perform an autopsy to determine why the equipment failed. Review the task procedures and frequencies to determine why you never caught the failure mode in the act of failure. Update the PM based on the findings.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Let Risk and Your Equipment Determine Your Maintenance Strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I attend conferences and workshops and read articles on maintenance and reliability, more and more I hear people touting that preventive maintenance is more costly and not the right approach. When we talk about preventive maintenance, we are primarily talking about time-based inspections, but it can include overhauls/rebuilds as well. But before we take statements like these as the gospel and apply them carte blanche to all of our equipment, we need to understand the basis for that reasoning and when to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the Reliability-Centered Maintenance side, we know that we can&amp;rsquo;t apply the single bathtub curve to all equipment failures. We recognize that six separate failure curves exist, and greater than 80 percent of all failures occur outside the infant mortality or end-of-life wear-out zones, meaning the failures are totally random in nature. No doubt that condition-based monitoring using various tools like vibration or temperature monitoring is better and a less costly solution over time-based preventive maintenance, especially overhauls. This provides the basis for some saying that doing more than roughly 20 percent preventive maintenance is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/11/45fd9688-b405-4933-b630-cfcb46130261_prison.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;RCM teaches us that maintenance is really about minimizing the consequences of failure or our risk. Our equipment and the risk should determine our maintenance strategy for any given piece of equipment, not someone telling us preventive maintenance is bad. To do this, we can use a tool like the RCM Logic Tree. The RCM Logic tree places the emphasis on safety and environmental concerns first, followed by production or capacity losses. If we can apply a condition-monitoring strategy, that is our first choice because of the random failures. However, not all equipment lends itself to a condition-monitoring approach, which leads us to time-based preventive maintenance inspections and overhauls. If we can&amp;rsquo;t detect the equipment in the act of failing using either of these based on risk, we can choose to re-engineer the equipment or run it to failure. If we choose &amp;ldquo;run to failure&amp;rdquo;, we should have a proactive strategy that returns the equipment to its normal state as quickly as possible (Neil Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Canon Law). Additionally, we should ensure that running an item to failure doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost us more money due to collateral damage (i.e. a bearing failure that takes out a shaft and the housing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let me give you a few examples of where time-based (cycles, hours, days, etc.) preventive maintenance is a better solution based on the equipment, the failure modes and the consequences of failure. Take a correctional facility and the lamps in the overhead lighting fixtures as the first example. In most organizations, we would choose to run these to failure, correct? In a correctional facility, the cell block has to be cleared of the inmates before the maintenance worker can access the lamps. Depending on the security level of the cell block, it may be more cost-effective to re-lamp all the fixtures at say, a 10,000-hour interval. Next, let&amp;rsquo;s take a contact lens manufacturer. The machines that form, shape and package the contact lens utilize small components like cylinders and small servo drives in tight locations that don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to many condition-monitoring approaches. Past best practice has been to change out some of these components based on the number of strokes or cycles. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s take a 165-valve bottle filler used in the various beverage industries. Organizations with this equipment typically run many shifts during their peak season. The filler valves typically don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to condition monitoring, and random failures with partial replacements during the shifts are cost-prohibitive due to downtime losses. Most choose to overhaul these fillers on time-based intervals to lessen the risk of failure during the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, in summary, while condition-based monitoring is a more cost-effective solution, the risk and failure modes must determine the maintenance strategy that you apply to your equipment. Use tools like the RCM Logic Tree to help you determine the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/CdPFgM7mNEQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What Plants Have Failed to Learn in 25 Years</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/4/912d9182-9821-4c64-b120-153c005606f5_sub.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, I left the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I gained experience in civilian industry, I began to appreciate the Navy&amp;rsquo;s aplomb for reliable engineering, exceptional training and consistent operations. Their penchant for comprehensive preventive maintenance programs also impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I found in industry 25 years ago was quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There was almost no redundancy in design; the failure of a single small pump could shut down an entire plant. Sanitary systems had been modified over time, introducing unsanitary attributes. Many components were chosen solely on initial cost, not reliability or life cycle cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator training was limited to &amp;ldquo;hit the green button in the morning, the red button at night, and call maintenance if anything goes wrong.&amp;rdquo; We especially didn&amp;rsquo;t train operators on what to do in abnormal situations, so small problems often snowballed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standard procedures (SOPs, CBMs), if written at all, were relegated to a dusty bookshelf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		And, nearly all maintenance was reactive in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So quite by accident, it seems, I began a career of helping companies do these things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I claim some small successes on my resume, at least in individual factories where I worked. But wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you think with all the improvements our industrial society has made, and with progressive publications like &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, that we would have evolved to a better place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My work recently took me back to some of the factories of a company I worked with long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technologies have improved with mix-proof sanitary valves and PLCs. But, there is still little control of changes and little redundancy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training is better regarding mandatory safety programs, but no better in system operation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SOPs remain on the shelf in most locations. The only nod to improved consistency is in the expanded use of automated controls (PLCs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Most sad to me is that maintenance remains almost entirely reactive. For all of the sophisticated predictive technologies that have been developed, a huge amount of our machinery is run to failure. Expensive systems fail prematurely, requiring big buckets of capital dollars to replace them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we had kept this same rate of improvement in other aspects of our business, we would still be calculating our financials on computers running Windows for Workgroups V3.1.1. We would be tracking inventory and shipments on spreadsheets instead of ERP systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By this point, I have surely angered some maintenance and engineering professionals. They have made great strides in their individual locations. That isn&amp;rsquo;t my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My point is, after 25 years, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ALL of our factories, large and small alike, be much further down the path than they are? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/8c2c7g4kXKY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Monitoring the Performance of Your Asset Management System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All reliability-centered continuous improvement programs must include both a process that effectively assesses the condition of the plant&amp;rsquo;s capital assets and a monitoring process. The British Standard Institution&amp;rsquo;s Publically Available Specification (PAS-55) states, &amp;ldquo;The organization shall establish, implement and maintain process(es) and/or procedure(s) to monitor and measure the performance of the asset management system and the performance and/or condition of assets and/or asset systems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The specification indicates your Asset Management System (AMS) must address both reactive and proactive monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A reactive monitoring process identifies past or existing nonconformities in the asset management system as well as any asset-related deterioration, failures or incidents. This sounds straightforward, but how do you cost effectively monitor or measure nonconformities in either the management system or physical assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A comprehensive AMS includes how the corporation&amp;rsquo;s physical assets are procured, commissioned, operated, maintained and disposed of.&amp;nbsp; It consists of &lt;em&gt;standard processes and procedures &lt;/em&gt;that govern production scheduling, operations and maintenance of these assets. If you only have one asset, this is relatively simple, but how do you effectively monitor compliance to standards across the enterprise for all assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most cost-effective way to monitor compliance of the processes and procedures used across the enterprise is to design or re-engineer the processes with performance monitoring in mind.&amp;nbsp; An often made mistake in performance monitoring is the deployment of technology and the technically skilled people to manage it with little or no consideration of the processes or metrics used to drive performance.&amp;nbsp; An alternative and less than ideal approach is to create processes that periodically audit or sample the processes, procedures and practices that are being used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Proactive Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proactive monitoring seeks assurance that the physical assets and the AMS are operating as intended. In reality, this requirement is the same as reactive monitoring. The only difference is timing. It&amp;rsquo;s like the difference between Root Cause Analysis and Root Cause Failure Analysis. Both are analytical tools that resolve real or potential problems. The difference is when you perform the analysis. If you perform it after the failure or incident, it is reactive. If you perform it before the failure, it&amp;rsquo;s proactive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Again, the best solution is to build monitoring and analyses into the &lt;em&gt;standard work processes and procedures&lt;/em&gt; that are used to perform all tasks or activities that directly or indirectly affect asset performance and reliability. This is done through key performance indicators designed to measure true leading and lagging indicators of asset performance and condition, as well as the work processes or procedures used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain them. This will only work with true indicators. For example, preventive maintenance compliance is only valid as a leading indicator when the right tasks are performed, at the right time and on the right asset.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it might in fact be non-value added work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Leading and Lagging Indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An AMS that depends on &lt;em&gt;lagging indicators &lt;/em&gt;is by definition reactive. To be proactive and effective, the AMS must also include &lt;em&gt;leading indicators&lt;/em&gt; that foretell non-conformance or deficiencies that can be expected at some point in the future. The mistake that too many companies make is limiting their AMS indicators to maintenance or failure-centric deficiencies. They limit their focus to things such as preventive maintenance compliance, wrench time and maintenance planning effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; While maintenance and failure or breakdown performance is important, much more must be considered and monitored for the AMS to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a minimum, the leading and lagging indicators must include all of the performance indicators that define the operating effectiveness and efficiency of assets, both physical and human.&amp;nbsp; Indicators such as labor hours per unit, cost of goods sold, energy usage per unit, etc., are effective leading and lagging indicators that provide the means to manage assets effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The obstacle we must first overcome is how to monitor and evaluate the performance and condition of critical assets and the massive volume of data that must be acquired, manipulated, interpreted and finally converted into actionable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many have tried to create autonomous systems &amp;mdash; some manual and some computerized &amp;mdash; to extract the raw data from the myriad of data systems throughout the enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Even the few who have managed to fully integrate their enterprise information management system and have automated most of the process still need the data interpreted and corrective actions determined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once structured performance monitoring is in place, the financial opportunities that lie within your asset management system will become apparent, and mitigating and eliminating these limiting factors will lead to real performance and continuous improvement. The result is greater asset utilization and a higher return on net assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An Effective PM Program Requires a Solid Foundation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	From previous surveys and depending on the audience responding, either everyone (upward of 90 percent) or a minority (less than 40 percent) has an effective preventive maintenance (PM) program. With the range so broad, let&amp;rsquo;s dig a little deeper to determine what it takes to have an effective PM program. For the purposes of this article, I also am including condition-based monitoring activities such as inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is the strategic and business case for your PM activities? Why are you doing the PM activities, and how did you come to choose those activities? Did you just pull them from the equipment manual? What value is the program providing you? No, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the &amp;ldquo;perceived&amp;rdquo; value. What is the measured value that you can prove to your partners? If they stop operating the equipment to give you a window to do PM activities (condition-based inspections and so forth, not necessarily component replacement activities), what do they get in return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yes, I understand those partners get &amp;ldquo;improved&amp;rdquo; reliability, but why did the equipment fail two days later after the PM was completed? What was improved about that? Oh, infant mortality again, right? OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An effective PM program requires a solid foundation; a bedrock that begins with an asset life plan. That is a strategic maintenance plan that begins with the business case and equipment operational life expectancy at the top level. It must include the operations scheduled use. At the bottom level, you must understand the equipment function, the consequences of failure and address the failure modes. You have to blend all of this together to find potential failures and proactively restore the equipment prior to functional failure. It is a comprehensive strategy, not just simply copying the equipment manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendation from the manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Needless to say, it requires top-level management support. In addition, you will not be effective if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a partnership, especially with your operations partners. You need to measure the value the effort brings and effectively communicate those to your partners and your own group. Where is your continuous improvement loop to optimize the findings from the activities? Are you capturing good information from your technicians back into the work order system? What about your root cause analysis effort that feeds the optimization even more? An effective planning and scheduling function is a requirement as well. The PM activity requires procedures written to a specification with the focus of standardized work and precision maintenance. It includes capturing that &amp;ldquo;tribal knowledge&amp;rdquo; and ensuring it&amp;rsquo;s the right knowledge. From the front-line supervision, there has to be an auditing component from a craft development perspective. Do we have the skills required to perform the work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not, how are you going to develop them? How can you determine success? Where are your measures that show the value? You need an inclusive set &amp;ndash; not around work measurement that creates animosity, but around the processes. Remember, the product is always a result of the process. Lastly for this article, what is your communication plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What other items would you add to those above as part of a comprehensive preventive maintenance strategy that includes condition monitoring activities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/1UzAOsalqeY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ALS Tribology opens new facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In business since 1961, ALS Tribology&amp;#39;s Cleveland Technical Center and commercial laboratory operation commemorated their 50th anniversary by moving into a newer, more modern facility. Located in the greater Cleveland area, the move was completed on March 28. The new location will accommodate expanded research and development, laboratory operations, and future operational growth. In addition to the Tribology laboratory, the center will house the Technical Resource Department, the Information Technology Department, and present and future centralized support services staff.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Web_Images/Cleveland02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enhanced workflow efficiencies and expanded commercial lubricant, metalworking fluids, coolants, and fuel testing services are made possible by the move to this newer facility. Vice President and Manager of North American Operations, David Doyle, shared, &amp;quot;The creation of a new facility for our technical center and commercial laboratory operations will strengthen support for our overall North American operations as well as continue to provide expanded growth possibilities and enhancements for our lubricants, coolants, wear analysis, and metalworking fluids testing services.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new ALS Tribology Cleveland Technical Center address is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ALS Tribology&lt;br /&gt;
	6180 Halle Dr. Suite D&lt;br /&gt;
	Valley View, OH 44125&lt;br /&gt;
	Phone: 800-726-5400&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobile lubrication system now available</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.wastequip-cusco.com"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;, a company operating under &lt;a href="http://www.wastequip.com" target="_blank"&gt;Wastequip&lt;/a&gt;, has introduced its mobile lubrication and waste fluid retrieval systems for servicing mobile equipment. The systems allow for servicing in the field when time does not allow for the return of equipment back to fixed service locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mobile units are equipped with seven different fluid delivery systems, along with a grease-dispensing system, a waste fluid recovery system and compressed air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typical applications include mining operations, oil field sites, forestry, construction sites and any company with fleets of equipment that may require servicing while in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Cusco&amp;rsquo;s mobile lubrication and waste fluid retrieval systems are ideal for everything from changing the fluid on an excavator in the field to changing a tire on a truck on the side of the road,&amp;rdquo; says Steve Godwin, president, Cusco. &amp;ldquo;Best of all, these systems are designed to perform in the most demanding weather conditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Universal Lubricants set to recycle used oil for Colorado company</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;WICHITA, Kan.&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;April 6, 2011&lt;/span&gt; /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Lubricants, America&amp;#39;s only true closed loop oil recycling company, today announced that &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt; on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair company Equipment Savers has hired them to recycle tens of thousands of used oil filters and approximately 55,000 gallons of used oil each year. The recovered oil from the filters and the used oil will be re-refined at the company&amp;#39;s advanced refinery in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt; to make its American Petroleum Institute (API) certified green motor&amp;mdash;ECO ULTRA&amp;reg;. The scrap steel from the oil filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products ensuring that nothing ends up in a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; tightly controlled closed loop oil recycling process gives us the piece of mind and confidence that our used oil filters and oil will be properly recycled,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Tom Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;, Service Manager at Equipment Savers Fleet Services. &amp;quot;For over two decades, Equipment Savers has been providing safe and environmentally responsible on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair services in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Arizona&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Texas&lt;/span&gt; and our relationship with Universal Lubricants furthers that corporate commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. produces approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used oil each year, and only 10% of it is re-refined. &amp;nbsp;The rest of the used oil is either improperly disposed of (damaging the environment) or burned as an industrial fuel and is gone forever. Additionally, over 400 million oil filters are used in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt; every year, containing 22 million gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, many of those filters end up landfills and the oil that they contain contaminates the environment and is gone forever. Universal Lubricants is working to reverse these trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants is dedicated to protecting the environment and conserving our natural resources&amp;mdash;each week we collect and recycle 150,000 used oil filters reclaiming thousands of gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;That reclaimed oil as well as the used oil will collect from around the country is re-refined back to high quality base stock oil and then blended to make our high performance, green ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; motor oil,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/span&gt;, Chief Executive Officer of Universal Lubricants. &amp;quot;We appreciate Equipment Savers commitment to making a difference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants collects used oil filters and oil from the government and private businesses such as repair centers, auto parts stores, dealerships, service stations, and oil change centers across &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt;. The company then transports those oil filters to its oil recovery center in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;. The oil recovered is put into the company&amp;#39;s technologically advanced re-refinery where it undergoes a state-of-the-art hydro-treating process to remove all of the water, fuel and solvents as well as metals, asphalt flux and other heavy contaminants. The purified high quality Grade II base stock oil is then blended with a synthetic formula and additives to make API certified ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products. The scrap steel from the filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants operates 28 facilities in 14 states, including a branch in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Denver, Colorado&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;For more information about Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products and used oil and filter collection services, visit &lt;a href="http://www.universallubes.com" s_oid="http://www.universallubes.com/" s_oidt="0" target="_blank"&gt;www.universallubes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/ljAX_tXIEU8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Is there life after the death of predictive maintenance?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It is sad how quickly a good predictive maintenance program dies, even though the program has gotten a manager promoted, convinced you and others that there is a lot of value in doing PdM to improve maintenance practices, saved money and gained credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The demise of a good program is usually due to the loss of the program champion. He was promoted because he saved tons of money and improved his maintenance practices &amp;ndash; just overall improved the company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. With a new department manager, the program fundamentally has started from the beginning. The new leader may not have any experience in the PdM world and cannot identify the need for continuing the process; he just sees costs for new equipment, training, equipment calibration, equipment upgrades, etc. In today&amp;rsquo;s world, with such a severe downturn, this is even more prevalent. Cutting costs for everything is the rule &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a shortsighted rule, but it&amp;rsquo;s one that we live by today and will probably live by into the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new department manager may just see the loss of an electrician or millwright, the people side of things. He has seen plenty of good workers disappear to retirement or leave for another job or get pulled out of the department to work in other parts of the plant. So, he sees his PdM people as being involved with non-value-added work when they could best be used somewhere else in the department or to satisfy his manpower-sharing commitment. The new manager also sees his people as being needed to keep the machinery producing, so preventive maintenance work and breakdown work are the priority, especially PM work, which he feels is much more important. That is due to the fact that PM completion is a measurement management has deemed as important, a key performance indicator which impacts monetary gains for the manager. PdM doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Therefore, doing PMs makes sense because it affects his bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing we forget is that the manager is human, too, driven by a different set of rules, most we are not aware of and don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand. We somehow have to come to terms with that reality because it is now our reality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this environment, the infrared thermographer, vibration analyst and motor testing personnel press on because they all have developed a fan base that knows what their technologies can do and have bought them in to their day-to-day processes &amp;ndash; to the point of building PMs for a lot of their equipment using the different PdM technologies. They know that the information generated is extremely important for them to make informed decisions. So these PMs need to be performed. They add value. So, they always get done to the benefit of the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the people who rely on the PdM analyst to give them needed data are the new champions of the PdM process. They continue to rely on this information. The analysts know this as well and they continue to perform their duties, though they are somewhat frustrated because it seems to them as if their efforts are not being rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then you get moved to the Central PdM Group &amp;ndash; heaven. You get to do the work you love all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	May you be successful in your career in your chosen field. I hope you find it very rewarding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Notes on non-invasive inspections and properly written work orders</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There are standard operating procedures (SOP), preventive maintenance (PM) procedures, and predictive maintenance (PdM) procedures in which both maintenance and operations engage. The most basic is condition monitoring, or operator care, and involves both groups. The equipment owners/ maintainers (both maintenance and operations) clean to inspect, inspect to detect issues, and on detection, correct those issues. Consider that condition monitoring/operator care should be a daily procedure (SOP) from the standpoint of listening, feeling and smelling the equipment operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The primary distinction for PM procedures over SOPs is that they are time-based and occur on a given frequency. Some PMs are invasive, but we want to use other PMs as non-invasive inspection tools along with operator care to feed our computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) with work orders that allow us to properly plan, schedule and execute corrective invasive actions when the right parts/materials are available.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	So with that said, you can see that there is an overlap between the SOPs and the PM procedures. This overlap gives us the opportunity to clean and inspect the equipment. During the inspection, we get the opportunity to detect issues that can be addressed immediately. For some items, especially the more invasive items, properly create planned work orders to correct later utilizing the planning and scheduling process.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With any of the above procedures (SOP, PM or PdM), each must be written to a detailed specification. With the attrition and retirement of the Baby Boomer generation and the increasing lack of skilled labor availability, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever that we write our procedures with step-by-step details. These procedures become training tools for those who may attempt to fill your shoes at a later date and are invaluable for certification programs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	What does &amp;ldquo;specification&amp;rdquo; mean? No, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to write a line to a procedure that says &amp;ldquo;turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen the bolt&amp;rdquo;, but the opposite extreme such as writing a line that says &amp;ldquo;adjust machine as necessary&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it either. Our goal is to set ourselves up for high equipment reliability by taking away some of the failure modes that lead to significant downtime in connected drivetrains or other parts. For example, belt tension that is too tight creates excessive bearing or shaft wear, or wears down the pulleys, as does misalignment. It also can create issues with gearboxes in the drivetrain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	For each component, the procedure should list the correct components based on the initial installation or approved modification. Another reason to list the parts is that things sometimes change in the heat of the moment &amp;ndash; i.e. the storeroom was out of #60 chain, so we modified it with #40 chain to get us by, and someone forgets to put a work order in to change it back to the correctly engineered parts. The #40 chain can snap later, causing downtime. Most likely, they changed it to #80 (bigger is always better, right?), and instead of being the weakest link, the oversized chain wrings the shaft off an 80-inch-wide conveyor drive roller and causes much greater losses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The procedure should have space on the form to note deviations from the norm, such as chain pops while rotating over the sprocket or chain is loose and dragging on safety guard. It&amp;rsquo;s nice when the form has a checkbox for each item so that if the person is called away, he or she knows where they left off in the process or if they have forgotten an item. It is a tool within the tool. The challenge is to education your people so they don&amp;rsquo;t simply pencil-whip the form without doing the procedures.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some examples below that are typically non-invasive:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Safety first! Any procedure (SOP, PM or PdM) should start with the appropriate safety procedures to de-energize and lock out the equipment to ensure personnel safety and prevent unexpected equipment operation. This may not apply to the PdM procedure for items such as vibration analysis or infrared imaging.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;V-belt or timing belt drivetrains &amp;ndash; Instead of a line such as &amp;ldquo;inspect belt&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Are the belts frayed on the edges? Is the belt material cracked or is the webbing broken? Measure the belt tension using a spring scale or the amount of deflection. Depending on the method and the manufacturer, the correct measurement parameters should be listed on the procedure since it varies based on the distance between the sheaves, etc. Each belt manufacturer provides this information on its Web site or in its technical documentation. Do the pulley grooves match the measuring gauge tool for the belt size or are they worn and in need of replacement? You specify/picture the tool and what the tool should measure in the procedure. Is the shaft key in place (if one exists) and is the pulley tight on the shaft? If using set screw collars, are the set screws at the proper torque? Is the belt properly aligned with the pulleys? A simple straight edge can be used for an inspection, but the proper belt alignment tools should be utilized on installing new or replacement pulleys. Remember, our goal of precision maintenance is to ensure equipment reliability, to prevent damage to other components, and reduce or eliminate equipment downtime.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Chain drives &amp;ndash; Instead of &amp;ldquo;inspect chain&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Does the chain pop or jump as it rotates on the sprocket? Is the sprocket worn? Again, manufacturers have gauges that allow you to quickly verify the proper dimensions, but you must indicate the correct measurement on the procedure. Is the chain worn? Is it too loose or too tight?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t forget items like lubrication, filling the bearing lubrication container (specify the right fluid), conveyor belt tensions, cleaning electronic enclosure cooling fan filters, and inspecting polycord belts at the joint and so on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	I&amp;rsquo;ll ask a good question along the same lines. How many of you have your grease guns calibrated to know how many pumps it takes to equal one ounce of grease? And, are the grease guns visually color-coded for each type of grease used in your facility? Are the grease points color-coded to match the appropriate grease guns and tagged with the greasing frequency and grease amounts required?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A grease gun is a deadly weapon in the wrong hands, capable of generating 15,000 psi and blowing out seals. Recognize that PMs such as lubrication PMs should be separate from other PMs so that you can adjust the frequency independently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	What we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about is the environment and culture that is required to make this a reality in most companies.

            <title>Equipment ownership for maintenance technicians</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance technician, do you believe having responsibility for specific equipment is the best way to perform your job? By responsibility, I mean you are the only one that conducts preventive maintenance tasks and major repair work on that specific equipment. Do you believe it&amp;rsquo;s the right answer for the organization? As a maintenance manager, is this approach to equipment ownership the right answer for you or your stakeholder partners like operations? In all of my time in engineering and maintenance, this facet of maintenance has been a struggle for many maintenance organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I was part of a team that built a pet food facility in Columbia, S.C., a few years back, the maintenance organization was modeled after similar organizations in the company. There were two maintenance technicians that covered each of three shifts and rotated across those shifts. Ideally, one was mechanical and the other electrical. Then, there were five or six day-shift maintenance technicians that had system ownership. There was one technician for the receiving, grinding, extrusion, drying, packaging and controls areas. Each of these maintenance technicians decided the day&amp;rsquo;s priorities, performed the preventive maintenance, handled the longer-term strategic improvements and capital work. Obviously, they were the &amp;ldquo;go to&amp;rdquo; guys or system &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; for any issues or work in their areas. They truly owned the equipment and took pride in the work they did. From a technician perspective, it was great as they called the shots and the business benefited. If they needed help doing something, they might ask another system technician to lend a hand or they may write a work order for some contractor resources to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But this model is not always as rosy as it appears from a maintenance management perspective. Consider Fred who has been the extrusion system technician for six years. This area is not for the faint hearted as it has 300-horsepower motors and large equipment with complex support systems. Fred was working on his daughter&amp;rsquo;s car at home and injured his back. He&amp;rsquo;s going to be out for three months, at a minimum. Since Fred is the only one who works on it, no one else has any expertise. Now what do you do? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some other items. While a maintenance planner existed, the system technicians decided the priorities for their work. That was by individual system areas, not the overall factory needs. The thought was, &amp;ldquo;Just because it was a priority for one area didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it was a priority in my area.&amp;rdquo; So there was no real overarching priority matrix that was enforced. Trying to get people to work on equipment outside their areas was like pulling teeth at times. Some guys didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with the approaches and methodologies that other guys used in their areas; so consistency was a factor. So, rather than one cohesive factory, you ended up with six silos each marching to their own drummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen some organizations encourage ownership and try to overcome the expertise issue by using an approach called &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. If the technician learned a skill outside his normal work area, then the business would compensate the individual with additional pay per hour. It was a management responsibility to make sure the people used those &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. Often, that never happens on a frequent basis. So, time goes by, possibly years, and the technician &amp;ldquo;forgets&amp;rdquo; how to do the work. The increased pay did not stop, however, and one day the call comes to send the technician over to apply those &amp;ldquo;secondary skills&amp;rdquo;. The maintenance technician isn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on the idea since its Fred&amp;rsquo;s area and they haven&amp;rsquo;t touched that equipment in three years. Up comes the safety flag and 10 reasons why they aren&amp;rsquo;t the right person for the job. Maybe they are right; you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, if management makes the technicians constantly rotate across the areas, you never build any expertise on any equipment &amp;ndash; and you don&amp;rsquo;t build any ownership, either. Many organizations face this struggle today. If the work gets complicated, they have to call the factory representative to come do the work, or it&amp;rsquo;s outsourced. If the equipment has been modified, the factory rep smiles and says, &amp;ldquo;Sorry, but that&amp;rsquo;s not our equipment.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not just skills related to production equipment, but consider someone with machinist skills inside maintenance organization. When the equipment is down and you need it, you generally need it now. Many shops don&amp;rsquo;t have mills or lathes anymore, not to mention the skilled people to run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of this is driven by how you align the maintenance organization as well (i.e. centralized or de-centralized). What&amp;rsquo;s a maintenance manager to do? How do you strike a balance between equipment ownership and building the skills through cross training, and having the ability to get the work done all the time? Is it based on the culture of the organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/izssm4W7rsM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>When troubleshooting equipment, first impressions are important</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt1_rc.jpg" /&gt;When troubleshooting a machinery problem, whether for an unusual vibration problem or a component failure such as a bearing or seal, first impressions from the initial machinery inspection are very important. Any troubleshooting exercise should begin with a thorough investigation of machine history - process, design, operation, maintenance, and all available machine details. These first impressions are necessary to make sure the troubleshooting team is fully armed with important data and minimize the chances of a misdiagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people new to the troubleshooting process have a tendency to immediately pick up tools and start working. A better approach is to put the tools down and collect first impressions. While they might not immediately reveal the problem, they may identify a number of issues that are impacting overall reliability. Recommendations for these initial inspections include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt2_rc.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall cleanliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Good housekeeping often reveals that machinery maintenance practices are held to a higher standard. Look beyond dust to the condition of the base and foundation, piping supports, seal leaks, etc., for evidence of maintenance practices or environmental factors that negatively impact reliability. What are the expectations that a field repair can be conducted without introducing contaminants that will shorten the life of the replacement parts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More detailed machine inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with the machine base and look for obvious signs of decay or improper anchoring. Move up to the feet and inspect the shims and hold-down bolts. Poor practices at the base often reveal a lack of quality of other repairs. Move to the shaft and drive (i.e., couplings, belts, etc.) and look for evidence of shaft damage, improper coupling assembly, and incorrect key length. While issues with these areas may not be the cause of the current problem, improvements made with the required repairs will improve machinery reliability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;If running, perform a basic vibration check:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a simple tool such as &lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/OverhungBase_cropped_rc+copy.jpg" /&gt;coin with serrated edges to obtain an impression of relative machinery movement if the machine is still running. While vibration measurements tend to focus on the bearings, with coin in hand, start at the base and work up to the bearing locations to feel for unusual movement. Pay close attention to boundaries and connections such as the base-to-foundation, machine feet-to-base, and all piping and conduit. A simple condition such as a loose base-bolt can have a dramatic impact on the machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Keep detailed notes of the initial impressions:&lt;/strong&gt; They will provide a comprehensive and professional report on improvements that will impact the life and reliability of the machine. While at the machine site, inspect other equipment in the area for similar issues and carefully present this information to the stakeholders. While no one likes to have their flaws revealed, a good presentation of steps that can be followed to positively impact machinery will be well received.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Strategies to optimize shutdowns, turnarounds and outages</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The traditional view of operational shutdowns, turnarounds and outages (STOs) holds that they are maintenance and engineering events. This simplistic view is held by many organizations. A more realistic and holistic perspective, however, recognizes that the impact and scope of STOs extend far beyond the maintenance and engineering functions. STOs can command significant capital and operating budgets. They attract the attention of shareholders and boards of directors, and impact inventory supply chains and customer relationships. They are, therefore, &amp;ldquo;whole business events&amp;rdquo;, not simple function-specific ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Considering all the potential ramifications, well-executed STOs can represent a source of competitive advantage for an organization. They can drive commercial performance, boost morale, bring recognition to high-performing teams and accelerate individual careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The corollary to this picture of success, of course, is that poorly executed STOs can cost an organization millions of dollars in lost revenue, drive up operating costs and cause permanent damage to the careers of those involved. This has long been true but is now amplified in the current operational environment, in which most organizations are operating with reduced workforces and resources. Simply put: In today&amp;rsquo;s leaner and meaner business environments, STOs represent not only an increasingly significant challenge, but also an increasingly significant opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STOs consist of the following phases of activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detailed planning and organization of the work involved&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removal of assets from production&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspection and work execution, product changes, repairs, improvement activities or a combination of these&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Restart of the asset/unit/plant and restoration to &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; performance levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STO work is usually &amp;ndash; but not always &amp;ndash; recurring or cyclic in nature. An STO is unique in that it &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;involves the plant, unit or asset being taken offline or out of service. An STO is not considered to be complete when the individual work packages are completed. An STO is complete only when the asset, unit or item is returned to service and performing at the desired level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	STOs are more complex than other project-based events. Quite simply, they involve both planned activities and unplanned work resulting from inspection of part of a machine or asset which is not accessible or visible during normal operations. The potential for identifying previously unforeseen or emergent work requirements discovered at inspection that must be performed within the defined time constraints of the STO adds the requirement of rapid troubleshooting and decision-making capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a moment to consider your organization&amp;rsquo;s current approach to conducting STOs. Is there a significant reliance on knowledge and experience? Are one or two team members considered critical to STOs because &amp;ldquo;they were there the last four times and know what happened&amp;rdquo;? All too often, the execution of a STO (with all the dependencies and ramifications we considered at the outset of this article) rides on one or two highly experienced &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; employees stepping up to solve the problem or &amp;ldquo;get it done&amp;rdquo; during STOs. But given the demographic shift that is now upon us, many of these individuals are destined to leave the workforce in a relatively short time. This, of course, is in addition to the everyday issues of absence due to sickness, transfers to another part of the business, or career advancement with another company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the knowledge and experience previously relied upon are no longer available for any reason, all the business issues which depend on the STO are in jeopardy. The challenge and opportunity then is to adopt a replicable, reliable, process-driven approach to STO management which harnesses &amp;ndash; but is not totally dependent upon &amp;ndash; team members&amp;rsquo; knowledge and experience, and enables easy knowledge transfer from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Kepner-Tregoe&amp;rsquo;s experience, the top challenges in managing STOs lie in the following critical areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Ensuring workforce safety, whether they are employees or contractors, is the No. 1 priority for the STO management team. &lt;/strong&gt;STOs present numerous challenges for safety. Large numbers of contractors may be working on site for the first time with little knowledge of equipment and processes. Employees will carry out many tasks which are not routine and only occur in the STO situations. For example, cleaning, inspection and repair will often be carried out with special isolation requirements in confined spaces or other challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) The development, deployment and communication of an effective STO process &lt;/strong&gt;which is clearly understood by all stakeholders, and which navigates all concerned parts of the organization through the complex challenges presented. Too frequently, the STO process is unclear, fragmented and not shared. Without a guiding framework, the coordination and execution of the complex tasks involved become extremely difficult. Many departments may need to plan inventory or resources if they are to be impacted in any way by the STO. A lack of general coordination is also compounded when the absence of a common approach results in a myriad of different methods being used, making coordination and communication close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Managing project scope creep is typically one of the top challenges for most STO management teams. &lt;/strong&gt;It is a particular issue in STOs where inspection is only possible when the process or asset is the STO (e.g. opening up a furnace to establish the amount of relining required). Managers need prioritization tools to help them make better decisions on managing emerging work to stay within plan and budget targets. Without such prioritization tools, STOs can quickly experience scope creep, leading to other work cuts from schedules which can have detrimental effects on operational performance after recommissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) The capture, analysis and availability of relevant information and metrics &lt;/strong&gt;via management information systems will enable the appropriate managing of activities and identification of future improvements. Measuring the right things, the right way, at the right time &amp;ndash; and communicating them appropriately &amp;ndash; allows STO leadership to maintain control of the diverse range of activities when work is being executed. While poor planning is usually blamed for cost and time overruns, if problems continue in future STOs, they are very often symptomatic of the absence of a good measurement and control system. This absence will either hinder &amp;ndash; or totally prevent &amp;ndash; the organization from understanding and learning from the problems it experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) The existence of business processes which do not support the needs of the STO. &lt;/strong&gt;We know from experience that organizations should continually evaluate (and, if necessary, adjust and align) their business processes in order to remain competitive, and that misaligned processes will cause inefficiencies. In most organizations, business processes are designed to enable normal day-to-day activities. They are generally not designed to cope with major peak loads, special cause events and the other unusual demands that an STO places on them. A key opportunity for improvement in STO effectiveness lies in re-engineering basic business processes so that they can accommodate the needs of an STO and its related potential emergent work requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Cost management and control in executing complex STOs. &lt;/strong&gt;The existing reporting and control systems do not provide STO budget performance data until sometime after the STO is completed. The STO requires a cost monitoring program that provides timely data throughout the STO, enabling those controlling activities to make more informed choices on course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) The coordination and management of complex resources. &lt;/strong&gt;STOs &amp;ndash; and particularly larger ones &amp;ndash; typically involve technical staff, corporate engineering, specialists, vendors, contractors, government bodies (safety, environmental, etc.) alongside internal employees, whom possess varying degrees of knowledge and experience. It is not uncommon in some operational environments for the number of people on site to grow by 300 percent when contractor resources are used to assist with STO execution. This puts a significant load on processes such as induction, isolation training, material supply and equipment procurement. Even if the internal team is generally experienced, an STO still can involve individuals in roles and carrying out key duties which are new to them. Without clear communication and management protocols, our experience has shown that up to 30 percent of the working day can be lost waiting for adequate instruction or searching for a resolution when a problem occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8) Transforming an organization from reactive to proactive. &lt;/strong&gt;Shedding a reactive culture and moving toward anticipating and resolving issues before they impact is also critical to STO success. Every organization has a hero or two &amp;ndash; people who are remembered for &amp;ldquo;saving the day&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and the individual&amp;rsquo;s reward for this kind of heroism can be great on many levels (job security, advancement, financial incentives, recognition, self-actualization). The problem is that heroism is only required when the organization is already in trouble. How many personnel are rewarded and recognized for the arguably more valuable heroism of thinking about and preventing things from going wrong? This is perhaps the most essential component in executing a successful STO. The few most efficient organizations we know already have replaced the &amp;ldquo;go and do it&amp;rdquo; mantra with that of &amp;ldquo;go and think it through properly first&amp;rdquo;, and have appropriately adapted their emphasis in terms of performance and recognition systems to encourage this type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9) Managing the expectations of diverse stakeholders. &lt;/strong&gt;As noted previously, STOs are more business issues than engineering events; yet, in many organizations, indirect stakeholders are rarely involved in the outage management process. However, one thing is certain, their voices will certainly be heard if restart is problematic, or if supply to market becomes an issue. A key skill requirement, and often a skill gap for todays STO leaders, is the engagement of key stakeholder groups early in the planning process. This enables adequate communication of the likely risks and consequences of the STO and keeps all impacted personnel informed during execution so they can plan their own areas of operation accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimizing the STO Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	STO optimization requires a holistic approach to managing the entire set of complex activities and relationships which exist in the shutdown-turnaround-outage (STO) process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To do this, several elements should be considered. First, a clear and common process framework must exist for the STO activity. Secondly, the processes that drive the flow of information and activities within the STO framework must be aligned and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are three primary phases that exist within a typical STO model. They are outlined in Figure 1 with sub-elements within each phase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/df1eb364-30b7-4780-ac87-11459d1f02a8_KT_STO_1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/6c217409-e3ed-4e31-acd7-77414c798ff6_KT_STO_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definition &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Definition Phase ensures the identification of major sponsors and customers at the initiation of the STO. It also provides communication channels for the business, business units and support functions to prepare the organization for the STO. The most suitable timeframe for the STO is determined by gathering data on the operational process, customer requirements, equipment needs, resources and other constraints. Once this information is processed, the Definition Phase drives decision-making activities in the &amp;ldquo;charter and scope&amp;rdquo; elements of the STO, where detailed objectives and boundaries for activity are defined. It should address the protocols for scope freeze and change control to ensure they are supported by the organization. Without such protocols, achievement of time and cost goals is practically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Definition Phase leads the team through the detailed processes of defining work activities, determining work packages and the resource requirements needed to carry out the work and performing primary risk assessment activities. It also should consider defining work in areas of STO tasks such as the decommissioning or removal of the asset from production. This can have a major impact on restart effectiveness and hamper the organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to synchronize restart with activities in other critical areas. The restart process itself is an area often underplanned and underassessed by STO teams, which in turn leads to poor production efficiency for extended time periods after units are returned to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On completion of the definition phase, the leadership team will have the first indications if the goals and objectives set for the STO are attainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Planning Phase is primarily concerned with the organization of the STO activity. Key activities take place to ensure resources are available to execute the work packages that make up the STO activities. Responsibility assignment should consider adequate levels of knowledge, skills and experience of assigned resource bottlenecks where people, but not required skills, are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, tasks can be sequenced and scheduled to confirm the viability of the STO duration, and if the resources identified are adequate to complete the work identified within cost constraints placed on the STO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning activity also focuses the organization on two critical but frequently understated aspects of the STO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		aligning business processes to facilitate STO implementation, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		developing metrics and measurement systems to track a balanced set of indicators to drive future improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All organizations have business processes guiding the daily operational activities. The organization may not be completely satisfied with such processes, but they do for the most part exist. The issue for the STO is that the operational processes that are in place often times are incapable of dealing with the incremental load placed upon them by key STO activity, such as induction, contractor management, procurement vendor payment, cost control and reporting to highlight a critical few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The STO team must carry out a process review to establish the robustness of key business processes. If necessary, redesign and additions should take place so that the processes enable a more effective STO. Often, if this action is not taken, upon post-STO review, it is discovered that these same processes have negatively impacted the STOs implementation phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metric and measurement systems are a component that also must be addressed. These key systems are the providers of information for management decision making, control, and the identification of areas for both recognition and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metrics are an area that are often underexploited in the STO. Generally, most outage metrics are limited to the single dimension of performance covering time, cost and the achievement of overall STO objectives. While these are clearly the fundamental success factors, other important types of metric &amp;ldquo;families&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; process, people, promotional and political which may benefit the team and activity &amp;ndash; are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However well selected the metrics, to be of value, they must be monitored by an effective measurement system that has the appropriate frequency and has clearly understood protocols for escalation and feedback. Good metrics are often devalued, if not nullified, by the inadequacies of the measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to the commencement of STO implementation, a final round of risk assessment should be conducted on the interfaces between groups. This step ensures that planning and risk assessments done at a functional level can form part of an integrated STO plan. The process considers interfaces for master schedules, resource leveling, resource conflict, responsibility assignments, communications and issue escalation. At the same time, all pre-STO work is checked for completion so that there are no surprises when the Implementation Phase begins. As the STO progresses, any emergent work will consume precious time and resources. These up-front risk assessments pay dividends in the long run by keeping emergent work to an absolute minimum. Tactical modifications of the plan &amp;ldquo;on-the-fly&amp;rdquo; will, of course, be necessary to ensure on-time finish, but can be minimized with adequate focus and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	However efficient the design and flow of the Implementation Phase, its ultimate effectiveness is dependent on the outcomes of the Definition and Planning Phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Implementation Phase provides a process to ensure the work that has been organized gets done. It is specifically concerned with the mobilization and management of resources and the monitoring of activities to ensure that they accomplish STO results to the standards required in a safe and proper manner. The Implementation Phase establishes the standards of behavior required to deliver the STO objectives. On a daily basis, teams must communicate, resolve issues, and provide updates among themselves and the management team. The visual representation of the performance, schedule and cost allows close tracking on the progress of the STO, as well as the surfacing of additional issues. This will help to ensure that the information needed for effective problem solving, issue escalation and decision making is available, where required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As STO work packages are completed, and the asset or plant nears reinstatement to operational status, modifications to the restart plan based on lessons learned from emergent work should drive a review of the plans. Risk assessment also needs to be conducted on any modifications before attempting to restart the plant so that potential problems are adequately addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key element in the Implementation Phase is the close monitoring and reporting of the restart activity itself &amp;ndash; and this is vital to the timely resumption of operations. Formal equipment acceptance and handover from external vendors and the STO team must be carried out to make sure potential problems are addressed and desired value is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the restart has been completed, the team inputs the required data into the communication value stream to ensure learning capture and subsequent continuous improvement. The STO team then can be released for redeployment to its next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tie That Binds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Our experience has taught us that the model described is extremely robust. That same experience also has taught us that to be effective as a holistic approach, connectivity &amp;ndash; linking the critical elements in each of the three primary areas &amp;ndash; must be present through the design and implementation of a communication stream which flows through the model. Without such a communication stream, the organization runs the risk of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		having a tendency to look at the optimization of each component block rather than the process as a whole;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		overlooking the complexity of interconnections between the components that can lead to gaps or white spaces in process or organization; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		having different module responsibilities and ownership, leading to inconsistencies in standards in the implementation of the STO process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of the communication stream provides constant information feedback loops among the key elements of the STO process model, and also facilitates closeout and review activities to gather and process information on lessons learned. The communication stream ensures that information flows effectively for the duration of the STO. Stakeholders and performance objectives will require metrics and measurement systems which ensure that implementation activities remain on track to deliver the goals required of the STO. These monitoring frameworks will use dashboards and other visual aids to create visibility for all stakeholder groups, and will promote active communication and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At closure, the objectives and deliverables for the STO are reviewed to determine whether performance and stakeholder expectations have been met. Lessons learned from all STO stakeholders, including contractors and vendors, are documented and codified for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What type of results has been seen using KT&amp;rsquo;s approach to STO management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Development, deployment and communication of an effective STO process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Having a defined process that STO stakeholders and the STO team understand &amp;ndash; and can follow &amp;ndash; minimizes the issues that organizations often experience at restart once STO work packages have been completed. The graph for Changeover Performance below shows how an international display manufacturer improved its restarts over a number of the STOs simply by using a visible process. There was a 318 percent improvement in output for the first 24 hours of production at restart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Changeover Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Capture, analysis and availability of relevant information and metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the highly time-constrained world of an STO, having accurate and up-to-date information is key to making the right decisions. A dashboard that was used at a long products steel mill displayed metrics on progress among various teams, overall progress, costs, safety audits, extra work and other indicators. When the daily dashboard was distributed to stakeholders, it enabled sponsors, STO managers and team leaders to stay in close touch with the progress and performance of the STO. The STO completed all planned work within the scheduled period, and did not record a single case of lost time or medical injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Overcoming business processes which do not support the needs of the STO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A recent engagement with an international mining company necessitated the creation or modification of a number of business processes that impacted STOs. By reviewing these processes &amp;ndash; including contractor management, procurement, predictive maintenance, preventive maintenance, business improvement, lockout/tagout, reliability, permitting and compliance, among others &amp;ndash; the organization was able to improve its ability to scope the STO, start work packages on time and reduce crew waiting times. The impact was significant. Lockout/tagout and parts issues fell by 75 percent, and equipment failures and safety incidents decreased by 30 percent as shown on the &amp;ldquo;Percentage of Issues vs. Prior Shutdown&amp;rdquo; chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/23c54e70-9829-4715-b23f-6faef3de2c85_KT_STO_4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Percentage of Issues vs. Prior Shutdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Coordination and management of complex resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A major oil company underwent a turnaround event in its Singapore refinery which, in excess of US $200 million, was the biggest and most expensive it had attempted worldwide. It involved specialists and sub-contractors with whom the organization had no prior working experience, and equipment which had never been used before. As they neared the event, staff and sub-contractors found that they did not know who to approach for resources, technical support and issue resolution. In other words, there was no clarity on ownership of the work packages. Was it the asset owner, the main contractor or both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establishing an effective communication process in this stage entailed, first, specifically defining roles, such as Approve, Lead, Support, etc., for each major deliverable. Then, through a series of communication sessions, assignments of responsibility for these roles were made among the asset owner, main contractor and sub-contractors. The result was clear ownership and resources who knew where to go when they needed specific types of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Overcoming a reactive culture, moving toward anticipating and resolving issues before they impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In 2006, a major building materials manufacturer ran five days over its planned STO. In 2007, using the KT STO management process, an STO planned for 30 days was completed four days early. The reason they saw this improvement? The detailed risk management allowed the company to identify and prepare for issues before they occurred. Understanding the links between work packages, the resources used and surrounding activities enabled the STO team to look at more than the list of tasks to be completed. The data collected also allowed them to more accurately plan their future STO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/6/quick/cd1b90d2-28fd-485e-bc84-4787a32c6505_KT_STO_5.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Planned Days Down vs. Actual Days Down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Managing the expectations of diverse stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By managing the expectations of the organization&amp;rsquo;s diverse groups, STO improved greatly at a high-production concentrator. If perception really is reality, the STO management needs to not only deliver but be seen to deliver. In this case, all key management personnel &amp;ndash; from the general manager through corporate to operations through to key vendors &amp;ndash; expressed confidence that the impact of the STO management had been better than ever before. Vice presidents spent time in other areas of the organization; capital expenditure authorizations were approved; operations had confidence in scheduling; contractor and vendor idle time decreased. STO quality was shown to have increased overall by 60 percent (measured by on time and on scope), while cost was shown to have decreased by 40 percent (cost of run STO). Key to these results was providing a common language, process and understanding of both, and managing stakeholders&amp;rsquo; expectations. Results and expectations are two different areas of managing the performance of people; this means it is critical that key leaders have a shared understanding, and good information on both what is of value, and what will be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Achieving Shutdown Excellence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Kepner-Tregoe&amp;rsquo;s shutdown programs focus on delivering shutdown results on time and on budget while reducing possible risks associated with shutdown activities. KT has key applications that will ensure a sound risk management system is in place for your business shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KT has experienced successful execution of multi-million-dollar shutdowns. The company&amp;rsquo;s services are tailored to meet the individual needs of your business ranging from single days of coaching/training to full-time project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The KT Approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	KT applications provide the following to shutdowns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Discipline&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A common process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visibility of daily progress&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Managed risk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Timely decisions by daily monitoring of cost vs. plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without careful planning and risk management, delays can cause the cost of lost production to far exceed the planned maintenance costs of a shutdown. A small investment in KT is minimal compared to the total costs of your shutdown or the risks of a poorly executed shut with costly delays and incomplete projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Types of Support Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	KT support for shutdowns includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shutdown definition facilitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project management training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shutdown management training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lean shutdown implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On the job coaching&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project planning support&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Project software training and support&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Full time on site support to shutdown or maintenance managers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Teams and leader development&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Audits and recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Selected clients with whom KT has engaged in shutdowns include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bluescope Steel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cement Australia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Onesteel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rio Tinto&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Success Looks Like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When management at a heavy manufacturing site engaged KT to improve its shutdowns, the emphasis was to complete the shutdowns on time and on budget. Past shutdowns had run over time; but this time, finished product inventory was low and there was no allowing for extra hours. By working with KT, the manufacturer exceeded expectations. The shutdown came in 4.5 days ahead of schedule and half-a-million dollars under budget. Start-up time to full capacity from the previous year was reduced from 10 days to 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf211.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (fig.1) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. Figure 1 shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (Figure 2). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf212.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. Figure 3 shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf213.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs. The R0F test rigs have been upgraded (R0F+), making them very flexible in terms of speed, load and temperature. A large number of R0F and R0F+ can be found at the SKF Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center, enabling 140 tests to be carried out simultaneously (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf214.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. Figure 5 shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf215.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (Figure 6) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf216.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. Figure 7 plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf217.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 8 shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. Table 1 shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties. All three greases are widely used and approved by various wind turbine OEMs. The choice of grease depends on the type of sealing, operating conditions and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers complete customer solutions for main shaft applications encompassing greases, housings, seals, bearing configurations, lubricating systems, lock nuts, mounting services, lubricants and analyses and condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF is contributing to sustainability and supporting environmentally friendly solutions through further development and application of its knowledge in grease lubrication, thus prolonging the service life of bearing systems and reducing friction, leading to less energy consumption. Extended service life and relubrication intervals lead to less need for maintenance and to a reduction of waste. This is achieved by using the knowledge obtained from fundamental R&amp;amp;D and model development in combination with product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1 &lt;/a&gt;shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@2"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8]. Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs. The R0F test rigs have been upgraded (R0F+), making them very flexible in terms of speed, load and temperature. A large number of R0F and R0F+ can be found at the SKF Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center, enabling 140 tests to be carried out simultaneously (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@4"&gt;Figure 4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@5"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@6"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@7"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@8"&gt;Figure 8 &lt;/a&gt;shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@9"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties. All three greases are widely used and approved by various wind turbine OEMs. The choice of grease depends on the type of sealing, operating conditions and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers complete customer solutions for main shaft applications encompassing greases, housings, seals, bearing configurations, lubricating systems, lock nuts, mounting services, lubricants and analyses and condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF is contributing to sustainability and supporting environmentally friendly solutions through further development and application of its knowledge in grease lubrication, thus prolonging the service life of bearing systems and reducing friction, leading to less energy consumption. Extended service life and relubrication intervals lead to less need for maintenance and to a reduction of waste. This is achieved by using the knowledge obtained from fundamental R&amp;amp;D and model development in combination with product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobile assets create a special management challenge</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#4c6e94"&gt;Asset management&lt;/font&gt; has taken on a new luster at many organizations today &amp;mdash; and for good reason. As the economic outlook continues to be unclear, it&amp;#39;s more important than ever for assets to deliver optimum business value &amp;mdash; across the complete infrastructure and at every stage in their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations with mobile assets, however, that can be a particularly challenging goal to achieve. As assets shift in location from place to place, establishing their status levels, and performing routine tasks like preventive maintenance, becomes significantly harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That, in turn, leads to many unfortunate outcomes. Operational costs inevitably rise as key assets function less efficiently than they should. Business processes that should quickly be triggered by problematic asset performance (such as work order creation or replacement requisitioning) are triggered more slowly &amp;mdash; if at all. Assets must be replaced more often, demanding not just new capital expenditure but more time and energy from team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To visualize these issues more concretely, imagine a hospital with an expensive medical mobile asset that, to serve different patients in different parts of the building, is moved from place to place. Unfortunately, this relocation process isn&amp;#39;t tracked as well as it might be. If the asset can&amp;#39;t quickly and easily be found, it can&amp;#39;t perform the tasks for which it was purchased in a timely manner. Furthermore, if this asset should decline in performance or even fail outright, due to ongoing difficulties in locating it and performing routine maintenance on it, the consequences for the hospital and its patients could be truly significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamically track the location and status levels of mobile assets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fortunately, IBM now offers a compelling new asset management solution that specifically targets mobile assets: &lt;font color="#4c6e94"&gt;IBM Real-Time Asset Locator (RTAL)&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RTAL tracks assets by interacting with sensor tags on those assets that communicate asset status data (such as location). In fact, the solution supports a &lt;b&gt;wide variety&lt;/b&gt; of sensor tags based on different platforms &amp;mdash; Wi-Fi, active and passive RFID, bar code, Ultrasonic, Infrared, Ultra Wide Band and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such extensive tag support makes it a relatively simple matter for organizations to select an ideal communications platform for any given asset, taking into account variables such as expected range of mobility, interference/blockage and others. If line-of-sight is going to be a problem, for instance, infrared won&amp;#39;t be a suitable candidate, but Wi-Fi or RFID might. If the asset generates an exceptionally high volume of data that must be transmitted a short distance in a minimum time, Ultra Wide Band will meet that need well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intelligent analysis and automated events help maximize asset ROI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once an appropriate tag has been deployed on a mobile asset, RTAL will continually collect and aggregate status information from it. This information is then analyzed via a processing engine that isolates special/target circumstances (such as performance falling below a given threshold, component failure, or the expiration of time needed before routine maintenance is performed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If subsequent action is indicated (such as maintenance or part replacement), that action can, in many cases, be triggered automatically by RTAL based on predefined rules. Furthermore, visualization of mobile asset status and performance is also simpler than ever to achieve, thanks to a central console that can display assets by class, tasks, organizational hierarchy and other criteria. Managers can, at a glance, determine how well all the mobile assets associated with a service or business group are performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extending the strong business case for RTAL even further is the fact that it also integrates with IBM Maximo Asset Management and IBM Tivoli Asset Management for IT. This interoperable design allows the organization to obtain even more business value from those solutions (should they already have been deployed), by extending their powerful feature sets and cross-domain functionality to mobile assets that were previously inaccessible &amp;mdash; and generating even more extensive insight into how assets are performing against goals and what action is needed in order to optimize that performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rich array of engaging new benefits and possibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What are the business outcomes? Longer asset life cycles, higher asset ROI, diminished costs and simplified management and compliance certainly lead the list. But many other compelling new benefits and possibilities can emerge as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, consider the common problem of asset loss (or theft). Think back to the earlier scenario of the hospital with expensive mobile medical equipment; such equipment should only be utilized inside given areas within the hospital that are known to be secure. At present, unfortunately, many hospitals have no easy way to establish when such assets have been moved outside those areas (and are therefore more vulnerable to loss or theft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With RTAL, that problem disappears. They can easily determine exactly where in the hospital the asset is at any given time. They can also set policies to decrease the odds of a problem&amp;mdash;for instance, by triggering an automatic alert if the asset is for any reason moved outside secure areas. Subsequently, the security team can take rapid action based on the knowledge of the asset&amp;#39;s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another area in which many organizations would like to see improvement is asset utilization, as well as the quantified intelligence associated with that utilization. How often is a given asset used? Where, physically, does that use tend to occur? Which team members make use of the asset, and under which circumstances? These questions are essential if asset management, in a larger sense, is going to be optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here too RTAL can play a key role. RTAL not only generates dynamic data pertaining to asset status and performance; it can also generate customizable reports that reflect how that status or performance changed &amp;mdash; in different locations, at different times or for different durations. This actionable insight helps organizations to ensure that assets are performing up to necessary specifications. It also helps them plan by establishing trends such as changing demand levels and budgeting/purchasing appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee productivity will also climb. Instead of spending fruitless time searching for assets, team members can spend it working and actually using those assets. And when you consider employees themselves are mobile assets, another benefit is evident: enhanced employee safety. RTAL can establish just where employees are in the event of a catastrophic emergency, and thus facilitate and accelerate policies designed to keep them as safe as possible by routing them from problem areas to safe areas with the minimum possible risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/2zWGAQMU56U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why are PM inspections not always effective?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Are you experiencing equipment failure even with what you consider a good preventive maintenance program? What questions are you asking about the failures? Are the &amp;ldquo;five whys&amp;rdquo; tying back to the actual PM tasking? Or are the &amp;ldquo;five whys&amp;rdquo; pointing to something else? Is the PM tasking appropriate for the results expected on the specific equipment?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many of us have had the wonderful experience of the expectation of children through the miracle of pregnancy. There are many things that need to happen and many checks and inspections that should be done to ensure the health and safety of the child and the mother. Those physicals and routine check-ups are, for the most part, common knowledge among the educated and well-read parents that are concerned about the present and the future of the family.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Now, consider where most of the focus is. On the mother and the child, correct? Most people focus on what is needed and necessary to ensure the health, well-being and safety of the mother and child. What about the car? When the contractions reach approximately three minutes apart and it is time to go to the hospital, the last thing anyone, especially the husband, wants is to throw the pre-packed suitcase in the car, load the already uncomfortable mother and get her strapped in, and then have the car refuse to start. One can feel the tension rising. Which of the family members is responsible for the maintenance of the car?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I know you are thinking the man is responsible! You can&amp;rsquo;t get away from that, given the boxes we are thinking in. If we consider the woman to be the &amp;ldquo;operational&amp;rdquo; entity, since she is the one producing the &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo;, and the man to be the &amp;ldquo;maintenance&amp;rdquo; entity and the one responsible both for the vehicle &amp;ldquo;equipment&amp;rdquo;, then we have some questions to ask and answer. Questions without answers don&amp;rsquo;t help in the pursuit of equipment reliability!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In both the family entity and the manufacturing and service entity, operations and maintenance are required to produce the product. Here are some questions to answer to help maintain the health, welfare and safety of the products delivered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Is the PM procedure adequate for the equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Is the PM procedure adequate for the operating parameters? Have the production rates been changed from design?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Is the existence of standard work instructions a requirement?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Is the adherence to the standard work instructions a requirement for both operations and maintenance and the routine auditing of standard work instruction adherence a routine factor in the culture of the facility?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Are the intervals of the PM inspections adequate to allow the procedures to functionally prevent failure maintenance in any manner, except planned and scheduled programmed and corrective maintenance that is accomplished in a controlled manner, with minimal impact on production? Are you routinely mining and refining the knowledge and expertise of the operators and crafts to enhance the reward of the specific PM procedure and tasking?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Are your reliability engineers applying their talents to addressing less than functional PMs?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Are your crafts capturing and coding the PM work orders appropriately to allow the reliability engineers the necessary forensic data to improve and tune the specific equipment PMs?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Are your planners, in conjunction with operations and maintenance, ensuring the timely scheduling of preventive maintenance inspections for compliance completion?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the birth of my first child, I became almost paranoid about the reliability of my vehicle to start and run. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a pregnant woman to the hospital in the middle of the night unless it is time. Likewise, life can become very anxious if she isn&amp;rsquo;t at the appointed place when it is time. My wife was really good at making sure I was certain the vehicle was functional and ready!&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Preventive maintenance is not a maintenance-only effort. Preventive maintenance is not an operations-only effort. There is a tremendous amount of communication, cooperation and coordination required by both parties to ensure PMs are effective. Rather like a family situation, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you say?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>That's amore! Italian power plant loves new filter strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management&amp;rsquo;s AMS Suite: Equipment Performance Monitor is helping Centro Energia Teverola S.p.a. improve the efficiency of its 150-megawatt combined cycle co-generation power plant in Teverola, Italy. Using this combination of software and services has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to optimize its maintenance strategy for inlet filters on the gas turbines, contributing to an overall efficiency improvement of more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing that even a small increase in plant efficiency can provide a significant increase in operating profit, Centro Energia Teverola deployed AMS Performance Monitor to plan and monitor its maintenance practices, including evaluating the return on maintenance costs. An integral part of Emerson&amp;rsquo;s PlantWeb digital architecture, AMS Performance Monitor combines thermodynamic model-based software with support from Emerson experts to detect degraded machinery performance and aid predictive maintenance planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before Centro Energia Teverola adopted AMS Performance Monitor, unexpected performance degradation of the filters on gas turbines required emergency installation of replacement filters, resulting in costly downtime, especially during a peak production period. Emerson&amp;rsquo;s solution now monitors the gradual deterioration in filter performance and calculates the cost of the resulting reduction in turbine performance. By comparing this with the cost of the maintenance required, Centro Energia Teverola can determine the most appropriate point to replace the blocked filter. AMS Performance Monitor also makes it easy to establish the manpower required to complete individual maintenance projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance at the plant is now scheduled for periods when energy production is less profitable and penalties for being offline can be avoided. This improved planning also has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to reduce average repair times from seven hours to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With AMS Performance Monitor, the return on investment is very fast. A single filter change has already paid for this service for two years,&amp;rdquo; said Vincenzo Piscitelli, general manager, Centro Energia Teverola. &amp;ldquo;We can assess the effectiveness and economic return of our maintenance activities, which allows us to determine, in a strategic and effective way, what maintenance work is required to improve equipment performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a remote service, AMS Performance Monitor does not require complex hardware or software deployed on site. Instead, process data is sent to Emerson&amp;rsquo;s performance monitoring center of expertise, in Teesside, United Kingdom, where experienced engineers produce periodic reports showing monitored performance. These reports can be accessed via any standard Web browser and are based on thermodynamic models developed for each machine. In addition to the online information, Emerson also provides advice about the operational efficiency of machinery. Existing or potential problems are highlighted, as well as new opportunities to improve overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Emerson Process Management &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>CRC offers guide to prepare your plant for hurricane season</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s hurricane season again. Time for devastating rains and flooding, causing billions of dollars of property damage every year. CRC would like to help you put a fast and inexpensive plan in place to recover your water damaged electrical and electronic equipment. This procedure, also available on the company&amp;rsquo;s Web site &lt;a href="http://www.crcindustries.com/ei"&gt;www.crcindustries.com/ei&lt;/a&gt;, can be used any time equipment is water damaged (floods, broken pipes and fire-related water damage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clean the equipment by flushing, spraying or dipping the equipment in clean water and drain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Apply a CRC degreaser like CRC Heavy Duty Degreaser or CRC Lectra Clean to remove oil, grease and sludge contamination not removed by water flushing, being sure to spray all contaminated areas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Saturate equipment with liberal amounts of moisture-displacing precision lubricant like CRC 2-26 or 3-36, and allow to drain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure resistance by taking Megger readings after the equipment has drained. If the readings are not up to minimum resistance levels, repeat applications of degreaser and precision lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When minimum levels have been reached, apply a precision cleaner like CRC Contact Cleaner 2000, XT-2000 Precision Cleaner or QD Contact Cleaner to remove any dirt particles before energizing equipment. Do not energize until minimum resistance levels are obtained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may need to do more than just restore equipment. You may need to do extensive clean-up in the aftermath of a hurricane. Maximum performance from power tools is important after a storm, so don&amp;rsquo;t forget additional products available from CRC such as: Chain &amp;amp; Wire Rope Lubricant, Belt Dressing, Air Tool Oil, Bar &amp;amp; Chain Lubricant, Universal 2-Cycle Oil and CRC&amp;rsquo;s wide array of greases. Also, remember the HydroForce line of products for general cleaning. Flooding and heavy rains also can produce an excessive amount of mosquitoes. Defeat mosquitoes with CRC Insect Repellent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CRC Industries manufactures a complete line of industrial specialty chemicals including: cleaners, degreasers, lubricants, corrosion inhibitors and paints. The company markets its products through electrical and industrial distributors nationwide. CRC Industries is certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/aJeo2Et5v04" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to prevent costly downtime from power outages at petrochemical plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Unplanned downtime at petrochemical plants due to electric power failure is more common and costly than the total of fires, floods, earthquakes, network outages, service failures and hardware problems combined. Recent economic studies estimate the cost of downtime to the U.S. economy due to power outages exceeds $150 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hourly downtime cost in the petrochemical industry is calculated in the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the health and safety implications of outage incidents can include catastrophic accidents and releases, making the system vulnerable to subsequent outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A utility problem? Not hardly. Eighty percent of outages at industrial plants are the direct result of the distribution system inside the plant &amp;ndash; i.e., failed equipment and systems belonging to, and maintained by, the industrial plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Even in the electric utility industry, the overwhelming approach to power outages is mitigation &amp;ndash; not pre-emptive measures for prevention,&amp;rdquo; states John Lauletta, CEO of Exacter Inc., an international provider of outage-avoidance systems and services. &amp;ldquo;How can plant managers take advantage of utility-grade solutions, when most utility strategies are run-to-failure?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a variety of new solutions being developed in the utility industry using Exacter technology that identify failing equipment in the formative stages &amp;ndash; long before an outage incident. &amp;ldquo;Our system finds electrical signatures emitted from overhead lines that indicate equipment degradation, or pre-fail condition,&amp;rdquo; continues Lauletta. &amp;ldquo;After surveying over two million poles for more than 120 utilities over the last three years, our technology has helped to pre-empt thousands of power outages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With Exacter, petrochemical plants finally have a utility-grade early-warning system that allows them to remove failing equipment long before an outage shuts the plant down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Exacter finds failing equipment that visual, infrared, and other methods cannot identify &amp;ndash; meaning it will prevent outages that even the world&amp;rsquo;s best systems could not uncover,&amp;rdquo; states Exacter vice president Geoffrey Bibo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Exacter technology is not new to electric utilities, it is new to the petrochemical industry. &amp;ldquo;For plant applications, our field team conducts multiple physical surveys of the facility grounds each year. Equipment in pre-fail condition is identified, located, verified and photographed for easy preventive maintenance action,&amp;rdquo; says Bibo. &amp;ldquo;The technology has been field-verified to be 100% accurate, and it&amp;rsquo;s the most far-reaching, pre-emptive measure for outage prevention in the petrochemical industry.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/udWF-v75scY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What do your PM tasks really do for your asset care strategy?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Proper asset care is critical to ensure that equipment is available to meet production schedules, support process flows and comply with environmental, health, safety and regulatory requirements. Asset care is the execution of the most cost-effective control strategy to address the predominant failure modes of that particular asset with its operating envelope. The intent of this strategy is to provide the required asset utilization at the lowest life cycle cost while also ensuring the asset makes it to the budgeted end of life. This care could be an operator care task, a predictive technology, a preventive maintenance task or job plan, and even doing nothing at all (run to failure). The asset care strategy is an output of an engineered system that includes a business process, RASI, and a properly configured management information system (Maximo, SAP, etc.) to ensure sustainability of the strategy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unfortunately, most preventive maintenance tasks lack the detail that will provide quantitative data for equipment history, and they are written without considering failure modes. The solution is to practice Preventive Maintenance Optimization (PMO), using all aspects to write preventive maintenance procedures that are value added, comprehensive, repeatable, organized, and specify a correct duration and interval of execution. Good preventive maintenance procedures will improve equipment reliability and increase predictability of failures. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are a few critical success factors to help you evaluate the preventive maintenance tasks in your current program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Value-Added:&lt;/strong&gt; These tasks should include acceptance criteria and how to properly determine what is acceptable. Measures or meter points also should be used for collecting data that can be trended to determine when condition-based maintenance is required. The result will be the longest useful life at the lowest operating costs. Personnel should see the value in the task, which in turn will increase the likelihood of it being effectively and consistently performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive: &lt;/strong&gt;PM tasks must include periodic calibration of critical components to ensure that the entire system is consistently maintained in near perfect calibration. They also should include periodic adjustment of clearances, drive belt tension, and other power transmission and operation components. Many system components are comprised of belts, gaskets, etc., that have a finite life, and the preventive maintenance tasks must include periodic replacement of these components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Repeatable:&lt;/strong&gt; PM tasks are written so various maintenance technicians are likely to perform the tasks in the same way with the same results. Task definitions must be complete and provide enough details to assure effective performance of the tasks. Tasks should be effectively organized to permit easy identification and use by the technicians. They should include sufficient disassembly and reassembly instructions, and could even include drawings, pictures or other visual aids to effectively perform the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Organized:&lt;/strong&gt; PM activities consist of multiple tasks that must be performed as expeditiously as possible to minimize downtime. Therefore, all preventive maintenance tasks must be organized into a logical sequence that facilitates effective and efficient execution of the required tasks. In addition, all supporting data (e.g. the task lists, drawings, specification sheets, etc.) must also be organized to exactly match the tasks to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Duration:&lt;/strong&gt; PM tasks should have the correct mean time to perform. The specific time intervals are provided for each task with the time intervals verified by direct observation of the supervisor and updated as part of the planning and scheduling process. Having sufficient supervision consistently present during preventive maintenance tasks will ensure that allotted time is used effectively and that tasks are completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Interval:&lt;/strong&gt; The frequency of the task should be consistent with the original equipment manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s (OEM) recommendation until the likelihood of occurrence of the failure mode the task is addressing is better understood from reviewing work order history or industry data. The correct interval will be reflected in the analysis of breakdown, trouble-call and correct maintenance historical data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have all the above aspects covered in your preventive maintenance tasks, your asset care strategy will have the infrastructure in place to support the relentless pursuit of continuous improvement. This in turn will provide the highest asset utilization at the lowest total cost of ownership through improved equipment uptime, increased production output, and decreased labor and material costs. Conversely, if you find that most of your preventive maintenance tasks do not hold up to this scrutiny, then consider an evaluation of the business processes, RASIs, and management information systems that support asset care in your operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>10 steps to prepare your company for the return of business</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you are like many in business today, during the past year it has been a challenge to just survive the &amp;ldquo;Great Recession.&amp;rdquo; Many companies have had to focus solely on survival, cutting workforce and other expenses just to survive to fight another day. Now that companies are starting to see some signs of rebounding demand, the question is, &amp;ldquo;Are you and your assets properly prepared to capitalize on this increased business when the demand arrives?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the downturn, many companies laid off experienced maintenance technicians and production operators, reduced production shifts, idled equipment, and spent the bare minimum, if anything, on maintaining their assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These 10 steps offer a cohesive approach to cost-effectively prepare your company&amp;rsquo;s physical assets and mitigate the risk associated with higher levels of demand for the return of business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that you have properly identified your value streams, constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;As demand for business or products that you used to produce returns and you add additional new business, it is important that you consider the effect that the additional volume will have on your flow and throughput. Unless you chose to outsource a specific portion of your prior process or downsized your capacity through equipment rationalization, you likely had very little or virtually no capacity constraints during the past year. Returning demand from prior products coupled with demand generated by new business can quickly result in capacity constraints. Any additional capacity or improvement to the cycle time of the constraint will result in additional saleable product throughput for the area.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Perform a general inspection of the constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Often times, it is necessary to re-instill the discipline to clean specific areas of the equipment, removing chips, debris or fluids that may have built up and started to affect the quality or potential longevity of the process. Depending upon the level of deterioration, you may need or want to accomplish this through a kaizen event focused on cleaning the equipment so that a more thorough inspection can be accomplished. All non-conforming issues should be noted, documented with a specific work order, captured in the CMMS and planned/scheduled for repair at the first convenient, available time.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Utilize predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies to perform a deeper evaluation of the specific condition of the constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Utilize ultrasonic equipment to inspect for hard-to-find leaks and an infrared camera to look for hot spots caused by loose or broken connections and bearings or motors that may be getting ready to fail. Utilize vibration equipment to assess the condition of specific bearings, motors, spindles and rotating shafts. Perform an analysis of the fluids to look for abnormal wear or contamination that could drastically reduce the longevity of the equipment or lead to catastrophic failure of the process. Document results and plan/schedule repair work for non-conforming items. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Consider evaluating total equipment capability (quality and reliability) of constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;New business/products may stress the capability of your current equipment, so it is important to perform a complete Machine Health Assessment (MHA) to evaluate the capability and reliability of the equipment. The MHA typically results in a detailed report that gives you the raw data and provides recommendations regarding equipment repairs or improvements. The recommendations can be categorized as nuance, important and critical to allow informed decisions to be made as to which performance criteria will be addressed and to plan those activities to minimize cost and disruption to the operation. Making these improvements proactively, before production gets ramped up, can help you avoid producing poor or inconsistent quality products, wasting your effort on expensive rework or having late/missed shipments, all of which will disappoint your customers and could result in lost business.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate the critical spare replacement parts for your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you have a comprehensive list of critical spare replacement parts identified for each constraint and critical equipment? If not, it should be a high priority to develop them. Once you have them (making the assumption that you used a robust process to develop them), make sure each of the critical spare parts has a specific parts plan identified and documented. Vendor-managed inventory, consignment, repair vs. replace and other strategies may be appropriate and cost-effective ways to mitigate risk and minimize cost. Many companies and OEMs chose to reduce the inventory levels they maintained during the past year. As a result, parts may have longer lead times or, in some cases, the supplier may have gone out of business all together. Once the plan with appropriate stocking levels has been established, audit the maintenance parts crib and the system to confirm that inventory levels match the plan and the actual physical parts available are properly reflected in the system. This is extremely important if you haven&amp;rsquo;t maintained the discipline to sustain a proper cycle-counting program during the past year. Prioritize the items that are below planned levels, determine how you will replenish them and proactively procure the items needed to execute your plan. Poor identification, inaccurate information or a poor plan for spare parts can have a devastating effect on your ability to serve your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Re-evaluate the preventive maintenance (PM) tasks for your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you reduce, ignore, turn off or quit executing PMs for your constraint and critical equipment during the past year? What may have been or seemed like an adequate level during the past year probably isn&amp;rsquo;t well suited to sustain optimum performance as demand increases and capacity becomes constrained. Review the prior PM plans and evaluate how predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies might be revised or expanded to help mitigate risk and reduce unplanned breakdowns. A robust, well-executed PM plan can help reduce that risk and increase uptime.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Consider integrating your production operators into the maintenance plan for constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Operators that are properly trained and engaged in autonomous maintenance tasks to maintain the equipment can make a tremendous impact on reducing breakdowns and increasing productive uptime. The level of engagement will vary from company to company, but if the company is conducive to engaging the operators and the leadership has the discipline to implement the accountability required to sustain the process, you can positively affect machine performance, operator attitudes and free up valuable maintenance resources to concentrate on more complex, higher-value activities to drive additional performance enhancements throughout the operation. While it takes some time to identify, set up and train operators to properly perform the appropriate cleaning, inspection and lubrication tasks, the payback can be quite valuable. Do not assume that the operator knows or should know what they need to do. Invest the time to do it right and get the buy-in of the operators and their direct supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Ensure maintenance technicians have the proper skills and training to maintain, troubleshoot, and repair your constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Do your current maintenance technicians have the knowledge and skills to properly maintain, troubleshoot and repair your equipment? During the past year, many companies lost or laid off experienced maintenance technicians. Even if your company didn&amp;rsquo;t downsize your maintenance staff, you likely minimized or eliminated much of your training program or expenses. Now may be the right time to reinvest in training your current staff to ensure they can effectively handle issues that will arise as you increase your production throughput and stress the plant&amp;rsquo;s capacity. Review the controls, programmable logic controller (PLCs) and systems associated with your constraint and critical equipment. Create a skills matrix of your maintenance personnel. This matrix can be developed in a highly scientific method utilizing tests and proof-of-performance demonstrations or you can simply develop this matrix utilizing input from maintenance peers, maintenance leadership and internal operational customers of prior maintenance support. Develop specific training plans for each of the technicians that target the skills and abilities required to support the specific controls, PLC and systems that make up the constraint and critical equipment. You should also ensure that each is properly trained and capable to perform problem-solving and root cause analysis. Proper utilization of these tools will help transform the maintenance effort from constant firefighting to one where the root cause is determined and mitigated or eliminated from reoccurring in the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Review, establish and align metrics to monitor progress for constraint and critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;It is not uncommon for maintenance personnel to use broad, general, high-level information or data to assess their overall effectiveness or performance. Wherever possible, get the maintenance data to a level of granularity that it can be aligned with operational performance data and reconcile the maintenance data or metrics against the operation performance metrics on a frequent basis. Remember, maintenance is a support service with the goals of maximizing operational performance, equipment availability, equipment performance and equipment longevity in a cost-effective manner. Routinely reviewing specific operational performance in conjunction with the maintenance metrics for specific operational areas creates an effective partnership between your maintenance and operational personnel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Expand the approach to encompass the appropriate non-constraint and non-critical equipment: &lt;/strong&gt;Once you have completed the nine steps above with a focus on the constraint and critical equipment, review the list of remaining assets or equipment, prioritize them into groups or subsequent phases and systematically implement the process on each group. You will need to determine whether it merits implementing this approach on every piece of your equipment or just to a certain level. Make sure you look for common groups of the same type of equipment within or between multiple plants. Take advantage of the effort spent on developing the comprehensive maintenance approach on one piece of equipment and implement it on all of them that you have within your enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Done poorly, maintenance can lead to unreliable assets breaking down at inopportune times. Done well, maintenance can be an enabler of a productive, quality-oriented profitable business. By investing in the people, the process and deploying the appropriate approach now, you can prepare and position your company to take advantage of the opportunities that materialize as the economy rebounds. There are no short cuts; you really do get out of it what you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/rIO5Rpu7IQ4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bearing repair, PdM program address downtime at Gallatin Steel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When your rolling mill equipment has an emergency, calling a vendor is like calling the paramedics. Timken recently helped bring Gallatin Steel, a flat-rolled carbon steel producer in Ghent, Ky., back to life after a period of downtime. The Gallatin site avoided further costly downtime in its rolling mill operations as the result of an emergency bearing repair and the installation of a predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gallatin Steel employees heard an unusual noise coming from a shaft on a rolling mill stand that was critical to the mill&amp;rsquo;s productivity. With assistance from an on-site Timken representative, the noise was identified as a broken bearing cage, which was the result of high speed and impact force upon a competing brand&amp;rsquo;s two-row tapered bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/timken001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. On the floor of the Gallatin Steel mill in Ghent, Ky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing, which had been in service since the plant opened 11 years ago, was removed and inspected. The cage was welded in the six places where it had fractured, and the gearbox was re-assembled. Timken also corrected the bearing clearance and made several other modifications to minimize any wear patterns that could occur after the assembly was mounted back in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help Gallatin avoid future emergency repairs, Timken installed a StatusCheck condition monitoring device on the bearing to measure overall vibration. StatusCheck, a wireless system designed to detect and monitor excessive levels of vibration and temperature, now alerts Gallatin&amp;rsquo;s pulpit operator to vibration changes, indicating potential problems in the mill drive train. The results can then be evaluated with Timken&amp;rsquo;s on-site technical team and further diagnostic testing may be required to understand the severity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>What's the role of the reliability engineer?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/12/20/45cc81b2-8183-421e-a611-a5ce00088b73_Fotolia_40410101_XS.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The primary role of the reliability engineer is to identify and manage asset reliability risks that could adversely affect plant or business operations. This broad primary role can be divided into three smaller, more manageable roles: loss elimination, risk management and life cycle asset management (LCAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loss Elimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the fundamental roles of the reliability engineer is to track the production losses and abnormally high maintenance cost assets, then find ways to reduce those losses or high costs. These losses are prioritized to focus efforts on the largest/most critical opportunities. The reliability engineer (in full partnership with the operations team) develops a plan to eliminate or reduce the losses through root cause analysis, obtains approval of the plan and facilitates the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another role of the reliability engineer is to manage risk to the achievement of an organization&amp;rsquo;s strategic objectives in the areas of environmental health and safety, asset capability, quality and production. Some tools used by a reliability engineer to identify and reduce risk include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PHA &amp;ndash; Preliminary hazards analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		FMEA &amp;ndash; Failure modes and effects analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		CA &amp;ndash; Criticality analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SFMEA &amp;ndash; Simplified failure modes and effects analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		MI &amp;ndash; Maintainability information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		FTA &amp;ndash; Fault tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ETA &amp;ndash; Event tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Cycle Asset Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Studies show that as much as 95 percent of the total cost of ownership (TCO) or life cycle cost (LCC) of an asset is determined before it is put into use. This reveals the need for the reliability engineer to be involved in the design and installation stages of projects for new assets and modification of existing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliability Engineer Responsibilities and Duties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of responsibilities and duties commonly found in the job description of a reliability engineer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Works with project engineering to ensure the reliability and maintainability of new and modified installations. The reliability engineer is responsible for adhering to the life cycle asset management (LCAM) process throughout the entire life cycle of new assets.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Participates in the development of design and installation specifications along with commissioning plans. Participates in the development of criteria for and evaluation of equipment and technical MRO suppliers and technical maintenance service providers. Develops acceptance tests and inspection criteria.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Participates in the final check-out of new installations. This includes factory and site acceptance testing that will assure adherence to functional specifications.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Guides efforts to ensure reliability and maintainability of equipment, processes, utilities, facilities, controls and safety/security systems.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Professionally and systematically defines, designs, develops, monitors and refines an asset maintenance plan that includes:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Value-added preventive maintenance tasks&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Effective utilization of predictive and other non-destructive testing methodologies designed to identify and isolate inherent reliability problems&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provides input to a risk management plan that will anticipate reliability-related and non-reliability-related risks that could adversely impact plant operations.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develops engineering solutions to repetitive failures and all other problems that adversely affect plant operations. These problems include capacity, quality, cost or regulatory compliance issues. To fulfill this responsibility, the reliability engineer applies:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Data analysis techniques that can include:
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Statistical process control&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Reliability modeling and prediction&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Fault tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Weibull analysis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Six Sigma (6&amp;sigma;) methodology&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Root cause analysis (RCA) and root cause failure analysis (RCFA)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Failure reporting, analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS)&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Works with Production to perform analyses of assets including:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Asset utilization&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Overall equipment effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Remaining useful life&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Other parameters that define operating condition, reliability and costs of assets&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provides technical support to production, maintenance management and technical personnel.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Applies value analysis to repair/replace, repair/redesign and make/buy decisions.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>A checklist for alignment and soft foot</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Several points should be checked prior to laser alignment in order to avoid problems later and to achieve good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep the following in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Foundation: &lt;/strong&gt;A solid, rigid foundation is essential for a successful alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Machine mobility:&lt;/strong&gt; It is advisable to set both machines with about 80 mils of shims underneath the feet in case one machine needs to be lowered. Also, jacking bolts provide a safer and more accurate way to make horizontal moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rigid couplings: &lt;/strong&gt;These must be loosened to achieve accurate readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Coupling play: &lt;/strong&gt;This can be avoided by turning the shafts a few degrees before starting measurements and then taking readings in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bearing play: &lt;/strong&gt;Check for excessive bearing play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Soft foot: &lt;/strong&gt;Check for soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soft foot can severely affect the operating condition of a machine, which will undoubtedly shorten its life expectancy. Here are a few simple tips to help avoid soft foot in your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate rust, dirt and any other contamination from the contact surfaces of the machine feet, shims and frame or foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Never insert more than four shims at a time beneath a single machine foot. More than three shims may cause a spring effect.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate external forces on the machine such as those from connected piping, conduit, auxiliary supports, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use high-quality, clean and uniform shims when shimming is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <title>Preventive maintenance vs. predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For some time, a considerable amount of confusion has existed over the appropriate way to inspect for the presence of a given failure mode. Should I perform some type of sensory inspection? Should I perform some type of quantitative inspection? Should I apply one or more condition-monitoring technologies? Should I apply some combination of these techniques to maximize the conditional probability of finding the defect? Essentially, how do I identify the presence of a defect in such a way as to maximize the amount of time my planning department has to effectively and efficiently develop the job procedures, order the parts, and schedule and complete the work before the conditional probability of failure becomes too high? An explanation of the types of inspections and how they complement one another goes a long way toward clarifying which ones are most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sensory inspections have long been considered the backbone of any good inspection program. It was believed that sending someone around often enough to inspect for problems with machinery would result in identifying defects in plenty of time to effectively mitigate unplanned downtime. The inspector would use sight, sound and touch to determine if anything had changed since the last inspection. Any change would be recorded, reported and investigated by a craftsperson on the next scheduled outage. While there is a tremendous amount of benefit to sending someone around to perform inspections, there are so many holes in this strategy that it should never be considered the backbone of the inspection program. Sensory inspections typically only identify the most obvious and drastic of problems. It is all but impossible for a sensory inspection to identify early, internal defects in machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enhanced sensory inspections fill that gray zone. They are both a sensory inspection and a quantitative measurement with condition-monitoring characteristics. These inspections utilize instruments like spot radiometers, strobe lights, handheld vibration pens and simple ultrasonic meters to detect defects further up the P-F curve. While these tools multiply the power of the human senses, they have their limit. These simple tools do allow for different failure modes to be detected, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t replace a comprehensive condition-monitoring program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantitative inspections can provide useful information when it comes to generating data for trending and determining the characteristic life of a failure mode. Quantitative inspections require someone to measure something. Very common quantitative inspections include measuring the temperature of a seal on a pump or measuring the backplate clearance on a pump impeller. These measurements provide data to the planner and engineer and help determine the need for further maintenance action. When designed properly, a quantitative inspection procedure details limits and typically expected measurements. Any inspection that requires someone to measure something should have the minimum, maximum and typical values, with conditional tasks defined for when the limits are exceeded. But a quantitative inspection performed at the proper inspection frequency rarely will have a measurement that exceeds the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring, also known as predictive maintenance (PdM), is the application of condition-based monitoring technologies, statistical process control or equipment performance for the purpose of early detection and elimination of equipment defects that could lead to unplanned downtime or unnecessary expenditures. And generally speaking, you must conduct this while the equipment is in normal operation, with little to no process interruption. The purpose of these tools (vibration analysis, infrared thermography, motor circuit analysis, etc.) is to find defects not possibly found through previously available inspections methods, specifically while the machine is in normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking advantage of the available technology lets you accurately assess the condition of parts and the presence of defects heretofore impossible to detect. An example of the advantage these tools have in the area of quantitative inspections or sensory inspections is the use of vibration analysis to determine the presence of a defect on a rolling element bearing. Previously, mechanics and millwrights relied on &amp;quot;lift checks&amp;quot; to determine the amount of clearance in a bearing. Unfortunately, this technique is only valid for bearing defects that resulted in the removal of material from the raceways of the bearing; this bearing would be pretty bad off to have thousandths of inches of play in it. Sub-surface fatigue is easily seen with vibration analysis and at this point in the failure propagation has resulted in no removal of material from the raceways. This is the most common example of the advantages of condition-monitoring technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, there are different types of defect inspection techniques that can be brought to bear on a machine, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. However, these techniques aren&amp;#39;t necessarily exact replacements for each other. Each determines the presence of the defect at different places along the P-F curve and, as a result, each gives the planning function different amounts of time to respond to the defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) can help you determine which inspection techniques should be applied, how often and with what degree of redundancy. Remember, the trick is to balance risk with rigor. How much risk you are willing to take with a given failure mode coupled with how much you are willing to pay for the inspection determines the appropriate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>BP links with universities to research engineering materials and corrosion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	BP has selected the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Manchester as its academic research partners to further investigate materials and corrosion science and technology. This long-term research relationship aims to enhance BP&amp;rsquo;s operational integrity and reliability in its exploration and production business.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	BP announced the launch of a major research collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Manchester. BP and the universities will work together on materials and corrosion research, as it applies to oilfield applications. The initial investment from BP has been $2 million, with the company intending to match this for up to a further four years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The initial emphasis of the research collaboration will be on materials and corrosion science &amp;ndash; including corrosion and corrosion-fatigue modeling, environmental cracking, novel coatings and new monitoring technology. This will extend over time to other mechanical integrity and reliability related subject areas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As BP&amp;#39;s operations move into more severe environments &amp;ndash; deeper reservoirs, higher pressures, higher temperatures, higher fluid velocities &amp;ndash; it needs materials and corrosion technologies to perform under increasingly harsh conditions. Equally, as oil and gas assets age, corrosion management becomes crucial to achieving safe, reliable and efficient operation of processing facilities and infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	BP&amp;#39;s Inherently Reliable Facilities (IRF) upstream flagship technology program is responsible for the further development of the company&amp;#39;s fundamental understanding of engineering materials and corrosion. The collaboration with MIT and Manchester will provide innovative, interdisciplinary academic input and support to the IRF program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Corrosion control, mitigation, and monitoring are significant concerns in our industry&amp;quot; said Simon Webster, BP&amp;#39;s vice president for the IRF flagship. &amp;quot;We recognized that the future success of the IRF program depends on having reliable long-term access to highly specialised materials and corrosion expertise and laboratory facilities. Our collaboration with MIT and Manchester will provide us with the world-class research access we need.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;This further investment by BP significantly advances our long standing relationship with the company across a wide range of engineering and management programs&amp;quot; said professor Colin Bailey, dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences at Manchester. &amp;quot;In addition, it recognises the importance of the research underway at the University and will support the consolidation of the University&amp;#39;s position as a world leader in corrosion control and materials research in extreme environments, which is relevant across the entire energy sector.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For MIT, professor Ron Ballinger noted that &amp;quot;The MIT/BP collaboration is an exciting opportunity to develop a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms of environmental degradation and the application of this understanding to the development of advanced materials for use in extreme environments such as those found in the oil and gas industry.&amp;quot; Professor Ned Thomas added, &amp;quot;Advanced energy production systems are increasingly materials limited so it is critical that our graduates are well versed in the role of extreme environments on materials behaviour and, in particular, the role of corrosion in real engineering systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steve Groves, BP&amp;#39;s IRF program manager, said that &amp;quot;BP is delighted to begin this collaboration with MIT and Manchester. By joining forces with like-minded research and technology organizations, we can apply a &amp;#39;bigger brain&amp;#39; to the challenging issues we face. This will have a real impact on BP&amp;#39;s bottom line, through our operational integrity and performance.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A rigorous selection process was used to identify the right university partners, with MIT and Manchester chosen based on their strong reputation and capabilities in the relevant fields. This research program will form part of BP&amp;#39;s global commitment to MIT and Manchester as leading academic research establishments.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As part of this long-term relationship, BP will also fund curriculum development at the two universities in order to help build a higher profile for oilfield materials and corrosion science in undergraduate and graduate education. In this connection, BP will also provide support for the Corrosion and Reliability Engineering initiative at The University of Akron in the form of a one-off commitment of $500,000. Through these collaborations, BP intends to support the development of the next generation of materials and corrosion specialists, as well as provide training and development opportunities for current BP staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Notes: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		BP&amp;#39;s Inherently Reliable Facilities (IRF) flagship technology program was created to help ensure that the company&amp;#39;s exploration and production facilities are safe, reliable and efficient. The IRF team is helping BP to improve and standardize its upstream capabilities in a wide range of areas, including corrosion control, materials selection, and inspection. These are all crucial elements for successful operations. IRF has a high-level goal of delivering one billion incremental barrels of non-proven reserves by extending the life of BP&amp;#39;s facilities and enhancing its ability to process aggressive fluids safely and efficiently. It also plays a crucial role in helping to protect BP&amp;#39;s privilege to operate around the world, and in optimising the cost of building and operating E&amp;amp;P facilities and infrastructure. IRF is a dedicated team of 20 engineers based in Sunbury, United Kingdom, and Houston, who work closely with colleagues in the BP E&amp;amp;P segment to identify business needs, and then develop and deploy technology solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At MIT, Professors Ron Ballinger (Nuclear Science and Engineering [NSE] and director of the H.H. Uhlig Corrosion Laboratory) and Ned Thomas (Materials Science and Engineering [MSE] and Head of the Department of MSE) are the co-Principal Investigators respectively leading the research and curriculum development efforts. The BP Centre will combine advanced modelling and simulation with state of the art experimental techniques. The MIT team includes professors Chris Schuh and Michael Demkowicz of MSE and Bilge Yildiz and Sid Yip of NSE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The University of Manchester is the U.K.&amp;#39;s largest single-site university, with more than 35,400 undergraduate and postgraduate students and 5,800 academic and research staff across 22 academic schools and hundreds of specialist research groups. The University has an annual income of more than &amp;pound;680 million and had a total research expenditure of &amp;pound;375 million in 2006-2007. The Corrosion and Protection Center&amp;#39;s research, at the University of Manchester, is supported by more than 70 students and research workers and 11 academic staff, making it the largest academic-based institute of its kind.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The University of Akron&amp;#39;s College of Engineering anticipates launching the first bachelor&amp;#39;s degree program in corrosion engineering in the United States. Initial funding for the program is provided by the U.S. Department of Defense, with student enrolment slated to begin next year. The gift from BP&amp;#39;s IRF flagship will be used to develop curriculum, deliver courses to undergraduate and graduate students, and advance workforce development, as it relates to the upstream oil and gas industry.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		IRF is also working to develop deeper relationships with two commercial laboratories (NPL in Teddington, U.K., and Intertek Westport in Houston), based on test work related to chemical inhibition, corrosion monitoring and materials performance. It is envisaged that these two laboratories will input expertise and facilities into the university research, in line with their capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Tips to predict bearing failures, measure lube film thickness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, there are two options of maintenance concerning electric motor bearings. One is to relubricate them and the other is to change them. Monitoring electric motor bearing condition is paramount to insure reliability. Electric motors are an asset that must be managed, and prolonging their life will insure more contribution to the bottom-line profit. Preventing collateral damage caused by electric motor bearing failure is true cost avoidance. There are several ways to monitor and measure bearing condition &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; ultrasonics, temperature, vibration analysis and shock pulse, just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because lubrication is the first line of defense for prolonging bearing life, it is imperative that the lubrication film thickness between the rolling elements and the raceways be measured and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubrication film thickness: What matters&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lubrication is the vital element between any moving parts and an absolute requirement in rolling element bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There has always been much discussion and debate regarding the questions of how much, how often and what kinds of lubricants should be used in rolling element bearings; and to many, it still remains a mystery. The following chart (Figure 1) indicates the many parameters related to the lubrication film thickness and film quality in a rolling element bearing. Even &amp;ldquo;sealed for life&amp;rdquo; bearings will lose their lubrication film thickness. Knowing how much lubricant is left in a sealed bearing can make the difference between productive uptime and unscheduled downtime. Knowing if lubricant is getting into the bearing will allow maintenance to maximize bearing life by optimizing oil film thickness and unscheduled downtime can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Differentiating between bearing surface damage and lubrication film thickness, as a bearing fault, is a measurable function. Knowing the difference is valuable knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="366" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps001.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case study No. 1: Maxim Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scrubber for cleaning contaminated water before dispersing into the waste water system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Four small 3/4-horsepower motors with integral &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; face mounted impeller pumps plumbed with PVC piping.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All four motors are running at the same time. (Figure 2.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After demonstrating how to monitor bearing condition and measure lubrication film thickness at this printed circuit manufacturing plant, we were asked to look at a small water scrubber. The screaming sound of a bad bearing could be heard, but they could not pinpoint which bearing was making the noise. Was it the drive end or opposite drive end of which motor? After a quick check, the bearing was identified and its condition was determined. This was a 6204.2RS sealed bearing (a sealed-for-life bearing). The cost was about $9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We left the plant with the promise to provide a quotation for a portable data logger instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the night, the bearing froze up and tripped the motor, so only three motors were now running. They lost one-fourth of the capacity of the system to clean water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day (before the repair could be made), the Bay Area Environmental Protection Agency inspector showed up. Water was still being dumped into the wastewater system. Because of the lessened capacity, when the water was tested, it did not meet the cleaned requirements. The fine was $32,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sad part is that they knew which bearing was bad. They also knew how bad it was. If predictive maintenance or condition monitoring was a part of their normal operating procedures, this downtime and fine would have never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="242" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps002.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 2: Electric motor shop at Laprino Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 700-horsepower ABB electric motor for driving a fan for dehydrating milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB motors have long recommended the use of shock pulse to measure their motor bearings. Many ABB motors are equipped at the factory with SPM adapters for quick-connect measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ABB motor was installed at Laprino Foods and failed within the warranty period. The bearing froze up and twisted the shaft. There was no lubrication in the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After careful review, the records showed that the maintenance personnel in the plant had indeed greased the bearing according to the recommended schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seal cap was removed from the end bell of the drive end exposing the bearing for inspection. It was found that a machining error was made during manufacture and the grease pathway from the grease zerk to the bearing lubrication notch did not line up. Grease could not get into the bearing. Even though the lubrication schedule was being adhered to, the bearing was not being measured, so no one could tell if lubricant was actually getting into the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production was interrupted so a new motor was taken from the electric motor shop&amp;rsquo;s inventory to replace the damaged motor. Before installing the new motor, a test run was performed. While the motor was running, a measurement was taken while lubricant (grease) was applied to the zerk. Without disassembling the motor or causing an intrusive action, it was determined that the grease pathway was in the correct place and lubricant was truly getting into the bearing. The bearing&amp;rsquo;s true condition was determined and the lubricant film thickness was measured and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB honored the warranty. The damaged motor was repaired and stored for a spare and the new motor is still running today. An online monitoring system (MG-4) continues to monitor these ABB electric motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="312" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps003.jpg" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 3: Evanite Fiber Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 125-horsepower motor and belt drive on an exhaust fan for a spun glass process used to make high-density filters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This example was not necessarily on the motor, but on the fan shaft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common bearing installation faults that affects lubrication film thickness is the installation and set-up of the tapered bore, double-row spherical roller bearing using a split tapered adapter in a mounted unit (i.e. pillow block bearing). While this is not an electric motor bearing,it is in very close proximity to every drive motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tapered adapter is used as a wedge device to hold the inter race of the bearing on to the shaft. All bearing manufacturers have recommended clearances for applying this type of bearing. This type of bearing in a pillow block housing is very common on larger fan applications and is a very popular style for many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="243" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps004.jpg" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the tapered sleeve (adapter) is drawn up too far by over-tightening the spanner nut (a very common practice), the internal clearance of the bearing will be removed, thus reducing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though these bearings are running with no apparent fault or vibration alarm, the reliability of the machine has been put into jeopardy because the operator cannot see the film thickness problem. Lubrication film thickness can be measured to determine the true condition of the bearing during start-up without setting a baseline and treading. Differentiating bearing surface damage faults and lubrication film thickness faults is powerful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 4: Superior Lumber Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25-horsepower motor driving an edger in a sawmill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standard foot mounted motors that are mounted in the vertical position must have special consideration related to lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The normally mounted bearing in a horizontal motor is supporting load/overhung load in the radical direction. If the motor is mounted in the vertical position, the bearing will see more thrust loads and the lubrication will run out through the opening of an open or shielded bearing. A sealed bearing will hold the lubricant reservoir in the lower half of the bearing because the bearing is lying on its side in this application. This position will also force all of the balls of a ball bearing to one side of the raceway, thus placing them all in a more loaded situation in both radial and thrust directions. Load affects the lubrication film thickness. Normally, a motor mounted in this position will need lubricating more often than what is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="298" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps005.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The ability to measure the lubrication film thickness is paramount. Better asset management and machine reliability can be obtained by measuring the film thickness as soon as the machine is turned on. This will prolong bearing and machine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is critical. It can be measured to detect and troubleshoot for proper lubrication amounts (over/under), the right kind of lubricant for the right job, to detect installation faults and even to pinpoint the lack of film thickness if there is a compatibility and/or contamination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing the film thickness of lubrication in rolling element bearings, even a sealed bearing, is information worth measuring. Lubricant should only be applied to rolling element bearings because of demand requirements. Measuring the bearing film thickness before you lubricate will insure that there is truly a lubrication requirement. Automatic lubrication supply systems can provide the optimum amount of lubrication at just the right time when signaled by an online measuring system. Knowing the lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is instrumental in best asset management practices. Knowing what really matters in rolling element bearings to insure machine reliability is knowing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/1SfkXA8h3KM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How does a PM program help eliminate component failures?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In answering the question posed in the headline, we must first define what PM stands for. According to Life Cycle Engineering&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Rx_Definitions_60.html"&gt;Rx Definitions&lt;/a&gt;, this could have one of many meanings. It could refer to periodic maintenance, planned maintenance, predictive maintenance (although normally abbreviated as PdM) and preventive maintenance. Despite the definition of each and how they differ, they all relate to asset care. A properly cared-for asset will net much higher utilization at a much lower total cost of ownership. This is accomplished by establishing a program that mitigates or eliminates failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Periodic maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the cyclical maintenance actions or component replacements carried out at known regular intervals. Usually intrusive, they are often based on repair history and regulated by current inspection results. Periodic maintenance includes inspecting, testing, partial dismantling, replacing consumables or complete equipment items, lubricating, cleaning, and other work short of overhaul or renovation. This usually requires equipment to be scheduled out of service and may be done at intermediate intervals, usually ranging from monthly to annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is, by virtue of cost, importance, extensive labor and materials required, etc., planned to ensure, when scheduled, that it can be completed with the least interruption to operations and the most efficient use of maintenance resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Predictive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is the use of instruments and analysis to determine equipment condition in order to predict failure before it takes place so corrective maintenance can be done in a planned and scheduled fashion. Examples include vibration analysis, oil analysis, thermography, airborne ultrasonics, non-destructive testing (NDT), motor current signature analysis, trending of process parameters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Preventive maintenance &lt;/strong&gt;is time- or cycle-based actions performed to prevent system functional failure. This proactive maintenance type generally includes scheduled restoration and scheduled discard tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure proper asset care, we must first understand our asset&amp;rsquo;s place in the functional hierarchy and its criticality relating to production process or value stream. This will also yield our lowest maintainable component. We now have the linkage to work orders, bills of material and reliability analytics. Once this is established, we then must understand the risk of the failures related to this component to determine the type of analysis we will use for developing our control plan to mitigate or eliminate these failures. This may direct us to a traditional Reliability-Centered Maintenance approach, a simplified failure modes and effects analysis, to follow the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommended maintenance, or to take no action since the component does not warrant any maintenance strategy due to a low risk ranking. In the event a hidden failure mode is identified for a critical component, a redesign would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once predominant failure modes are identified, controls must be put in place in the form of tasks. The preventive maintenance tasks must then be developed in the Task or Asset Activity module of the enterprise asset management (EAM) system so that a work order can be generated, planned and scheduled. In order to be effective, this task must meet the following: 1) based on a predominant failure mode, 2) comprehensive, 3) organized, 4) repeatable, 5) value-added, 6) proper interval, and 7) valid duration. There also should be a method to identify the skill level and acceptance criteria necessary to accomplish the task. Finally, a business process must exist to provide feedback on the condition of the component, actual duration to accomplish, and reliability analytics in place to validate all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Making preventive maintenance really work for you</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Is an inspector actually doing the inspection on the task list? Thatâs one of the toughest maintenance problems to solve. Horror stories about maintenance catastrophes often feature task lists that were signed but not performed. &lt;BR&gt;Step one is to pick the right people. âA successful preventive maintenance (PM) program is staffed with sufficient numbers of people whose analytical abilities far exceed those of the typical maintenance mechanic,â writes August Kallmeyer in the book âMaintenance Managementâ. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Why pick high-level people? Because they can detect potentially damaging conditions before those conditions arise. Your best tear-down mechanic is not necessarily your best PM inspector. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A great PM inspector can work alone without close supervision, is interested and trained in new advanced predictive maintenance technology, knows how to review a unit history and its class history, is proactive â acts on predictions rather than reacts to situations â detects deficiencies early, is not interrupted and (while in the PM role) is segregated, if practical, from the rest of the maintenance crew. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Step two: Motivate your people to do the tasks as specified when the tasks are required. Most people find PM tasks boring and mind-numbing. The challenge for leaders is to inspire the troops to want to do the tasks well. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The inspector mentioned in this section can be a regular part-time mechanic (or helper, if appropriate) or a full-time PM mechanic. Here are some steps you can take to help ensure compliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make sure the inspector knows how PM fits in with the overall scheme. Inspectors for nuclear power plants or airlines know full well the impact of missing a PM â and even then, it happens. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Take your top managers down to the bowels of your plant and have them address maintenance crews about the criticalness of PM and output or safety. (You might have to write the speech.) People attend to what they think management thinks is important. Let them hear it from the horseâs mouth. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Present the job as important. If people feel that PM is stupid, boring and low-priority fill-in work, they are less likely to put themselves out. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let your PM mechanics themselves design the system and tasks. Train them in reliability, Total Productive Maintenance and general maintenance management. Then, let go of the reins. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Be explicitly certain that your PM people are fully trained. Someone with the title maintenance person, electrician or millwright must have the skill to perform the PM task. A test for PM certification might be appropriate. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Improve the relationship between the mechanic and the maintenance user. Where there is an operator such as a driver, machine operator or building contact person, instruct the mechanic to make personal contact. Some PM task lists include âtalk to operator and determine whether equipment has operated normally since the most recent visit.â &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make it easy to do tasks. Simplify paperwork, re-engineer equipment to simplify the tasks, and route people to minimize travel. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Improve accountability by mounting a sign-in sheet inside the door to the equipment. Be sure the people who do the tasks sign a form and are included in discussions about the equipment. When people know they might be quizzed about an asset, they are more likely to complete their PM tasks. When people know that an inquiry is conducted after a breakdown and that the PM sheets are reviewed, they have motivation to complete their tasks. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Make PM a game. One supervisor got up a bit of money and bought 50-cent gift certificates at a local fast-food restaurant. Each week, he hid eight 3-by-5 cards (which said, âsee meâ) inside equipment to undergo PM. He traded the cards for the certificates. &lt;BR&gt;So when a card wasnât found, he knew PM hadnât been done. His comment: âWhat people will do for 50 cents they wouldnât do for $17.50 an hour!â &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Give your PM professionals new, better toys (sorry â better tools, not toys). Technology has opened up the field for sophisticated, relatively low-cost PM tools. They might include $700 for a pen-size vibration monitor, $500 for a cigarette-pack-size infrared scanner or $1,500 for an ultrasonic detection headset and transducer. If appropriate to the size and type of equipment, these tools motivate the troops and increase the probability that they will detect deterioration before failure. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Stave off boredom. In any repetitive job, boredom sets in. To improve morale, consider job rotation, reassignment, project work, and office work such as planning, design and analysis. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The last key to success is to ensure that the mechanic has the information, tools and materials to complete the job: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Actual task list, with space for readings, reports and observations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Equipment manual (or ready access to the manual). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Standard tools and materials for short repairs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Specialized tools or gauges to perform inspection. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Standardized PM parts kits. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;People tend to wait till something goes wrong before acting. PM is diametrically opposite to human nature â it doesnât happen organically. In this article, I hope you found some ways you may not have thought of to help PM survive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;About the author:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Joel Levitt is a leading trainer of maintenance professionals.

            <title>Who should decide the right frequency for preventive maintenance tasks?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Routine, time-based preventive maintenance is a fact of life for production-critical equipment. But, who should decide how often these tasks are performed? Should it be the maintenance team (led by the maintenance manager) or the production manager and the operations group? While the question may seem odd (maintenance people should decide when its work gets done, right?), many plants allow production to define maintenance scheduling by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let me explain. In many plants, production occurs 24/7, 52 weeks a year, perhaps with the exception of a one- or two-week maintenance shutdown. Under these circumstances, careful planning needs to occur so the backlog of maintenance tasks that can&amp;#39;t be done with machines running can be completed in the allocated outage period. But when it comes to lubrication, many tasks simply can&amp;#39;t wait a year (or longer) between intervals. Take, for example, regreasing bearings. With the exception of small and/or low-speed element bearings, logic dictates that bearings be regreased more frequently - in some cases, as often as once per shift. But unless the bearing is accessible during normal operation, as opposed to being hidden behind guards or machine interlocks, the only time the bearing will be greased is when production makes the machine available to maintenance. In this case, production schedules drive maintenance decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same logic applies to oil changes. Consider a small yet critical centrifugal pump. Many pumps of this type contain just a few gallons (or less) of oil. But, changing oil can be a real problem if the pump can&amp;#39;t be shut down without taking down production; and while some may advocate doing an oil change &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s not recommended or the preferred course of action. Of course with circulating systems, larger oil volumes coupled with the ability to &amp;quot;sweeten&amp;quot; the oil through bleed and feed (draining a small amount of oil from the reservoir and replacing it with an equal volume of new oil) makes this less of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about filter changes? Most circulating systems have inline filters on the supply side and, in some cases, return line filters. But unless these filters are arranged in a duplex configuration with the ability to valve off one of the filters with the machine running, filter changes won&amp;#39;t be determined by oil analysis or differential pressure as best practice dictates, but instead by machine availability as determined by production schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, how can we avoid these problems? We&amp;#39;re not about to advocate modifying production schedules except in the most exceptional cases. Instead, we must modify the way we maintain our machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The place to start is during the design and installation phase. In past columns, I&amp;#39;ve talked about &amp;quot;maintainability&amp;quot; - having machines designed and installed in such a way that tasks like regreasing bearings or changing filters can be done without the need for intrusive system access. Maintainability needs to be built in from the outset, during equipment design. While it&amp;#39;s possible to modify in-service equipment to allow better intrinsic maintainability, it often takes significantly more time, effort and money to do this after the fact than it does from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second consideration is in the selection of lubricants and accessories (filters, breathers, etc.). If accessibility to a machine is limited to a year (or longer), the plant should consider using premium lubricants such as synthetics that will generally last longer than conventional mineral-based lubricants and may indeed last a year or longer without the need for an oil change. Where contamination is the driving force for a shortened PM interval, consider using better breathers, mechanical seals or large filters with greater dirt-holding capacity. Or, perhaps equipping the machine with quick connects to allow a portable filter cart to be used to decontaminate the oil while the machine is running is all that&amp;#39;s required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final consideration is in efficient planning and scheduling. When outages and production schedules dictate PM intervals, resource requirements will fluctuate from periods of low demand to &amp;quot;all hands on deck&amp;quot; when the machine becomes available for maintenance. But when maintainability is used, coupled with the appropriate use of premium products and accessories, the highs and lows of maintenance resource scheduling are less pronounced. Likewise, through the use of appropriate software tools that provide for options such as job kitting, dynamic job planning and current machine operating status, maintenance can take advantage of &amp;quot;golden opportunities&amp;quot; - times when the machine is unexpectedly down for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common complaint I hear from maintenance people is: &amp;quot;Production won&amp;#39;t let us have the machines in order to properly maintain them.&amp;quot; While there&amp;#39;s a measure of truth to this statement, there&amp;#39;s plenty we can do to insure that the maintenance team fulfills its mandate to deliver reliability and availability to the operations team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/preventive_maintenance/~4/gWyvrVhqOA8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Infrared part of effective PM strategy at Weyerhaeuser</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;If you can use a digital camera, you can learn to operate the Fluke Ti30 thermal imager. While the images from the Ti30 may not make it into the family photo album, they could very well save your business thousands of dollars when integrated into your overall preventive maintenance strategy. Just ask Dave Feniak at the Drayton Valley, Alberta, location of Weyerhaeuser Company, one of the worldâs largest integrated forest products companies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Feniak, the sawmillâs electrical maintenance supervisor, purchased the imager and, after some basic training on its use, went into the plant and found a problem â a big problem. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have been doing IR (infrared) scans routinely on a six- to nine-month basis since 1992 or so, and we usually find very few problems. I was looking at bearings in the planer mill and noticed a very hot spot in the far distance,â Feniak said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Ti30 has a built-in laser pointer, and once Feniak turned it on he found that heat was being generated about 150 feet away from the sawmill trim-saw motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âTaking the camera right over to the motor, we saw the motor windings were at 90 degrees Celsius (194 Fahrenheit),â he said. âWe did amp checks and found a severe imbalance between phases. This was on a Thursday, so we got our spare motor out and installed it the next morning on the maintenance shift, with no downtime. If the motor had failed on shift, the cost would have been approximately $30,000 for the downtime, plus the repairs would have been more expensive.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Weyerhaeuserâs $14,000 investment quickly paid for itself. And, it has certainly helped to legitimize the concept of preventive maintenance at the sawmill. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOur electrical department is just starting to build a predictive maintenance program,â said Feniak. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The company uses an outside contractor for infrared scans on a routine basis. Between IR scans, Weyerhaeuser uses a single-spot temperature gun, but diagnosis of problems is limited, Feniak said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âUsing the Ti30, we can quickly and easily see details of the problems,â said Feniak. âOur sawmill is constantly pushed to be faster and we target increased reliability. Using this tool has already shown us problems in early stages, allowing us to add oil to a gear reducer or replace a fan on a motor before the problem got worse.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These measures give Weyerhaeuser the time it needs to plan, schedule and make repairs before equipment fails, avoiding major breakdowns and costly downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Studies show that a planned repair job typically takes only half as much time as an unplanned job. In his book âPlant Engineerâs Handbookâ, Keith Mobley links the following benefits to preventive maintenance: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Maintenance costs â down by 50 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Unexpected failures â reduced by 55 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Repair and overhaul time â down by 60 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Spare parts inventory â reduced by 30 percent &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ 30 percent increase in machinery mean time between failures (MTBF) &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ 30 percent increase in uptime &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And for the typical manufacturing plant, a 10 percent reduction in maintenance costs has the same bottom-line impact as a 40 percent increase in sales. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The technology behind the Fluke Ti30 thermal imager is infrared thermography, which detects the infrared electromagnetic energy emitted by an object and converts it into a signal that produces a color image on the camera screen for immediate viewing. The image also can be stored for further detailed analysis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Fluke Electronics Canada sales representative Ken Reeves, the unitâs software helps users take area measurements and then print a report with images and annotations to use as supporting documentation. That can be particularly useful in dealing with insurance underwriters, Reeves adds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIt helps to have the thermography study in your preventive maintenance report so the insurance underwriter has proof that a problem was fixed and that the plant will stay up and running. If your report shows you made the necessary repairs, the insurance company will have no problem covering downtime expenses,â Reeves said. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reeves encourages purchasers to take advantage of the two-day training that comes with the unit. Training covers technical nuances such as conduction and thermal dynamics. Designated technicians completing the training can then show others at the plant how to become effective with the device. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOne mill employee took the training at Snell IR, primarily to become familiar with image analysis,â said Feniak. âBecause the imager itself is quite simple to use, we are training ourselves in-house on how to operate the tool and capture images.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As Feniakâs experience shows, adding thermography to a preventive maintenance program can significantly improve both the reliability and efficiency of plant systems. Feniak suggests a good way to investigate the usefulness of a thermal imager is to ask a Fluke representative for a demonstration and spend 20 minutes with it out in your facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSince 1992, we have had a reputable contractor scan our site every nine months, and our faults continue to decrease each year,â said Feniak. âEven so, we found several interesting warm spots using the Ti30 that we were able to correct before they became a problem. The opportunity for us is that we can scan every item in our plant more frequently, not just the critical points on our contractorâs list every nine months. We can also do in-house PM (preventive maintenance) on more equipment than we currently do with a contractor.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Don't overlook subjective inspections</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;This article series explores sample business processes that need to be implemented in order to improve overall plant reliability. In parts one and two, equipment life-extending activities were detailed. This article will touch on elements of condition monitoring. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Condition monitoring (CM) is not a life-extending activity. Life-extending activities are things such as lubrication, alignment, balancing and operating procedures. It's very important to keep this very basic fact clear in all communications within your plant; otherwise, too little importance may be placed on the planning and scheduling of corrective work orders originated in CM. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;CM only provides information on failures before there is a breakdown. You can do it with inspection tools - vibration monitors, infrared temperature guns, pressure gauges, volt meters and others. You can also execute CM subjectively by looking, listening, feeling and smelling (let's avoid tasting, shall we?). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article is dedicated to the somewhat lost skill of subjective (look, listen, feel, smell) inspections. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These days, we tend to rely more and more on technology. Computers are great, but they can be awfully bad at interpreting machine condition. For example, how do we get a computer to: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;find a loose bolt for a reasonable cost before there is mechanical looseness? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;see dirt buildup on an electrical motor before heat increases? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;find a recently plugged breather on a gearbox? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;find the location of a leak in a pneumatic system? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;pinpoint a problem with a photocell that is knocked out of alignment? 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These problems could somehow be found accurately with a computer, but a properly trained person would only need about 10 seconds to see the problems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How well is your plant doing with mechanical, instrumentation and electrical inspections? While articles often talk about the management systems needed, I'd like to list some basic examples in order to rediscover the subjective inspection methods. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Regardless of whether you're doing inspections with handheld computers or a paper system, can trend data or not, or have key performance indicators or not, you won't be successful unless your people can do quality inspections on equipment. Here are the examples: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=subtitle3&gt;Example 1: AC motor temperature &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If your inspectors look at motor temperature, do they take the time to think about the significance of a hot temperature on the coupling side of the motor vs. a hot temperature at the center of the motor? A hot temperature in the center often means a damaged winding or an overload situation, while a hot temperature at the coupling side of the motor means a bearing problem of some kind. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=subtitle3&gt;Example 2: Couplings &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are couplings and the equipment attached to the coupling operated to breakdown mode, or are problems found before a breakdown occurs? All couplings that can cause a breakdown costing more than a few hundred dollars should have an inspection lid so the coupling element, bolts and keyways can be checked easily. (The cost of inspection would be, at maximum, $100 per year.) Preferably, the inspection should be done with a stroboscope while the equipment is running (see Figure 1). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Tor---Figure-1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Tor---Figure-1.jpg" border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1. A coupling can be inspected on-the-run &lt;BR&gt;with a stroboscope. Note that this plant has&lt;BR&gt;followed OSHA 1942 regulations for guard safety.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=subtitle3&gt;Example 3: Heat exchanger sacrificial anode &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The basic function of a sacrificial anode is to protect surrounding material. A common use is to place a plug in a heat exchanger's cast iron shell (Figure 3). The anode is usually made of zinc and will slowly corrode instead of the iron shell. The phenomenon is called galvanic corrosion. How would you inspect the zinc plug before it starts to leak in a critical application? Drill a small hole to a shallow depth in the center of the zinc plug. A small leak will be visible in the center of the plug well before it is time to change it. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Advisor-Tor---Figure-3.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Advisor-Tor---Figure-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Advisor-Tor---Figure-4.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Advisor-Tor---Figure-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 3. Inspections of zinc anodes in a heat exchanger are simplified&lt;BR&gt;by drilling a small hole. When the anode wears away, a small leak&lt;BR&gt;will develop so that the need for replacement can be detected earlier. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=subtitle3&gt;Example 4: Pump packing &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pump packing replacements turn into emergencies in some plants because the wrong mind-set is in play. If it doesn't leak more than the recommended one to two drops per second, it's usually not examined. Why not change the mind-set? Make sure packing is changed when there is only one-eighth of an inch of takeup left in the packing (Figure 2)? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Tor---Figure-2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200611_Tor---Figure-2.jpg" border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. Change the pump packing when there is&lt;BR&gt;one-eighth of an inch of takeup left in the packing. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=subtitle3&gt;The Numbers &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;IDCON recently collected information on how work requests were initiated in a large process plant. We collected all work requests over seven months and analyzed how the work was found. The data showed that close to 70 percent of all problems found from CM were picked up subjectively by operators and mechanics through detailed look, listen, feel and smell inspections. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many problems wouldn't have been found if it wasn't for vibration analysis, infrared technology and oil analysis. But the data makes you wonder if we don't underutilize subjective inspections. They are a very powerful and cost-effective maintenance tool. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Energizer goes with the flow</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=264 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Spread.jpg" width=200 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global lean enterprise director &lt;BR&gt;Steve Hockridge (left) and lean coordinator &lt;BR&gt;Dana Billings have seen the benefits of &lt;BR&gt;bringing together lean and reliability.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are three types of manufacturing companies that implement lean: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it in name only to satisfy or attract investors. Lean is confined to buzzword status in annual reports and ads. 
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it on the surface. They construct a few U-shaped cells, paint the walls and throw out some clutter, then exclaim, âThatâs it; weâre lean.â Lean is a âhome improvementâ project for the plant. 
&lt;LI&gt;Those that do it right. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellPadding=5 width=200 align=right border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=left&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;Just the Facts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Site: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Energizerâs battery manufacturing plant in Maryville, Mo. The plant opened in October 1971, and has had expansions in 1973, 1978, 1980, 1993 and 1997. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant size:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Just over 500,000 square feet. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant employment:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The site employs approximately 500 âcolleagues,â including 94 in maintenance. It employed 50 people when it opened in 1971. The plant is not a unionized facility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Products:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The plant manufactures batteries in the following cell formats: AA, AAAA, C and 9-volt. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FYI&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Energizer spun off from Ralston Purina in 2000 . . . The Energizer Bunny, the companyâs marketing icon, debuted in 1989. In 2000, it was named as one of the top five advertising icons of the 20th century.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Few fall into that third category. A recent report from QAD Inc. found 80 percent of surveyed companies said they currently have âa lean initiative,â but only 1 percent had documented lean practices in place. Not enough plant and corporate leaders take lean manufacturing beyond the surface level. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not enough go deeper and view it as a valuable tool for the improvement of machinery reliability and the enhancement of total asset capability and performance. Robust and efficient mechanical assets are a precondition that lays the groundwork for foundational elements of lean such as flow and flexibility. Recognizing reliability as a key part of a lean transformation allows companies to better achieve goals that hit the bottom line â reduced inventory, costs, throughput time and work in progress, and increased quality, uptime and productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Energizer, the worldâs largest battery manufacturing company, can count itself in that 1 percent of firms doing lean the right way. Within a short amount of time, it has achieved incredible results through focused activities that push the envelope on people, process and production performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Every day, Energizer seeks to improve by bringing together lean and reliability. Just like love and marriage, its people know that you canât have one without the other. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have some very lofty lean-related goals for the company, but we cannot and will not achieve them unless we have reliable equipment,â says Steve Hockridge, Energizerâs global lean enterprise director. âYou canât improve labor productivity or achieve lead-time reductions or reduce inventory without it. You canât increase the speed at which you flow product to the customer if you have to account for equipment reliability issues that force you to carry buffer inventory. The only way to do all of that is by improving the reliability of your equipment to the point where itâs always ready whenever you need it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Joe Tisone, the companyâs vice president of global operations, concurs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn our business, speed and flexibility are key elements to success,â he says. âYou canât be fast or flexible with unreliable processes. If the machines donât go, we wonât have flow. Therefore, we view lean from a total business perspective.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This story will share some of the lean techniques that have made Energizerâs plant in Maryville, Mo., efficient and proactive from a machinery maintenance and mechanical reliability perspective. It will also serve to hold this organization and its people up as role models of flexibility, agility, ability, creativity and team-based solutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;MARYVILLE ROOTS&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Unlike some manufacturers, Energizer didnât make the leap to lean as a result of a burning platform. The company, whose history begins in 1886, was on solid financial footing at the dawn of the 21st century. After spinning off from Ralston Purina in 2000, its revenues, profitability and market share grew. But that didnât mean it was satisfied or complacent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-1.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive maintenance analyst Clyde Henry turned the plantâs oil &lt;BR&gt;drum repository into a clean, color-coded lubricant management center.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf you donât change, youâll be left behind,â says Tisone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Key customers such as Wal-Mart and Target continued to expect and demand more. Energizerâs longstanding competitors in the U.S., and emerging ones from Asia, exerted market pressure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the plant level, Energizer facilities that were built in the early 1970s, such as Maryville, began to show some age. As a result, machinery downtime and reactive maintenance work increased. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have done some very positive things over the past 25 years to take cost out of our products, but we did it in a traditional way, with large batches and efficiencies of scale,â says Hockridge. âIt may have been appropriate then, but the world changes and you have to adjust.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Energizerâs journey into lean â and the unification of lean concepts to machinery reliability â began in Maryville . . . and somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 2000, Dana Billings, the assistant plant manager for the Maryville site, became fascinated by the improvement principles employed by companies such as Toyota. Later that year, he began experimenting with 5-S workplace organization activities and had some success. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âDana kept nudging, pushing, prodding,â says Hockridge. âHeâd cut out articles and feed this information to Joe Tisone. Heâd send them with a note saying, âThis is stuff we need to get into.ââ &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tisone read the articles on an airplane trip to visit an Energizer plant in Singapore. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=200 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-2.jpg" width=300 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Each nail machine now features see-through doors, &lt;BR&gt;interior lighting and an external lubrication system.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf youâre flying to Singapore, you have plenty of time for reading,â says Billings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The information struck a chord with Tisone. He proceeded to read books on the subject, attend seminars and visit âleanâ plants. In November 2002, he traveled to all 22 Energizer sites around the globe and introduced lean to plant employees. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As the initiative gained momentum and structure, Hockridge was selected to oversee its implementation on a global basis and coordinators were named to drive lean at the individual plant level. Billings became the lean coordinator for the Maryville site. These leaders helped shift lean from an âinteresting and intriguingâ concept (the kind that, through 5-S, was making introductory, surface-level improvements at Maryville) to a holistic approach capable of producing wide and deep benefits. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;THREE LITTLE LETTERS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reliabilityâs role in Energizerâs emerging lean program was not an afterthought. As lean was taking shape at the corporate level, Maryville introduced ACW. This three-letter acronym, short for autonomous care workshop, changed the way the plant and its more than 500 employees looked at production, maintenance and dancing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ACW began in June 2003, one month before the companyâs official lean kickoff. The first ACW took place in one of the plantâs molding areas. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe business was good, and we pushed the machinery hard,â says Hockridge. âWe wanted to do an event in this area to really bring these machines back.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ACW format is a blend of kaizen, Reliability-Centered Maintenance, technical education, root cause failure analysis and Total Productive Maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-3.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Operator Vicki Cady and mechanic Steve Piveral go over their &lt;BR&gt;preventive maintenance assignments in the nail production area.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;During a weeklong event, several maintenance mechanics team up with operators from a production area to jointly construct a game plan to achieve high levels of reliability for equipment in that area. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mechanics open a piece of equipment and talk to operators about its contents and how these components work, individually and as part of a system. They explain (and, in some cases, show) the signs of and reasons for component wear and failure. They also instruct on proper practices that prolong component life and ensure equipment health. During the process, operators convey their insights and experiences on this equipment to the mechanics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Together, they then identify defects in a machine, troubleshoot the root causes, and create mechanical and process fixes that greatly reduce the chance of failure. They examine current, recommended and rationalized preventive maintenance requirements and determine the best overall PM strategy. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Afterward, a plan is constructed to realize improved equipment health. PM checklists and standard work instructions are built. From this point on, reliability on a day-to-day basis becomes a joint venture between mechanics and operators. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThere used to be very tight boundaries between what maintenance did and what production did,â says global maintenance manager Joe Plagens. âWe wanted to create more of a partnership â a relationship and linkage â between these two organizations. What lean helps us do is have a setup where the operator takes on more of an ownership role of their equipment. They take on responsibilities to ensure its upkeep.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This isnât about sticking operators with a âto doâ list. This is about shared responsibilities and a shift in asset care strategy from reactive to planned and proactive. It is time-based and âorchestratedâ to maximize cooperation and task completion and minimize downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plantâs nail production area (a brass nail is a component of batteries) provides a perfect example. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each week, mechanic Steve Piveral and operator Vicki Cady jointly schedule the PM activities for the areaâs 15 machines. At the predetermined time, they meet to go over the standard work instructions for the operator tasks and the mechanic tasks. The instructions are sequenced, step-by-step, for efficiency. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe dance steps are orchestrated. Who is going to do what and when?â says Billings. âIn that choreographed activity called PM, it becomes a partnership. âYou need to do this so I can do that.â It becomes a whole new way of performing the maintenance dance.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On this day, Piveralâs activities (generally more technical in nature) are scheduled to take 10 minutes to complete and Cadyâs (cleaning, oiling and greasing) are slated for 90 minutes. When Piveral completes his tasks, he goes to a file of planned work orders for that machine. He finds the job or jobs that fit in the remaining time. Piveral and Cady complete the work, and get the machine running again. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI feel like Iâm more involved and more of a part of things,â says Cady. âI know how to do the lighter maintenance tasks. I think what I do helps the machine stay in better condition and perform better.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Piveral also sees the positives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI used to do 30 hours of PMs each week in this area. Now I have 10 minutes on each machine (15 machines) in three weeks. Thatâs 150 minutes in three weeks as opposed to 90 hours in three weeks,â he says. âThe hidden value in all of that is now I can do that planned work I could never get around to before.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This concept is widespread at the plant and instrumental in the push toward planned, proactive work. Four years ago, 20 percent of work orders were for planned maintenance; today, that figure is 60 percent and growing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âUnplanned maintenance costs us four times more than planned maintenance, so I guess that makes my job four times more important than it was originally,â says predictive analyst Rick Staley. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;KEEP IT SIMPLE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Maryville employees believe they see the plant, and its machines, differently as a result of lean and reliability activities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe have bright engineering minds here, and engineers can think in very complex and elaborate terms,â says Billings. âMuch of what we have is specialized equipment. So, with our background, we like to design or purchase machines that do 15 things before they spit out a part. Lean, on the other hand, teaches you to look at things in very simplistic terms. You want to simplify every facet of maintenance, production, quality, etc. Itâs been a transition for us, but I think we are seeing the light.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Complexity greatly increases the chance of waste (excessive motion, inventory, conveyance, etc.). It also increases the risk of unreliability (based on its sheer number of capabilities and components) and extended downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Engineers, mechanics and operators now re-examine individual machines, cells and entire production processes and look for simple, reduced-waste solutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âItâs all about separating the value-added steps from the non-value-added,â says Hockridge. âLetâs keep the value-added steps. But why do we have excessive equipment that loads the product into the process this way, or why do we have all of this extra conveyance for this process? Itâs waste. The plant used that thinking in one area and removed 30 pieces of equipment. The end product is the same. But the process is simpler and more reliable, and the quality is better. When you take out that much equipment, you increase your chance of reliable performance. Also, how many PMs disappeared at the same time? Weâre focusing on the stuff that matters.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This isnât an isolated example. Billings and Plagens noted a handful of projects that each eliminated more than 30 pieces of equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hockridge says this shows the importance of uniting lean and reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âDonât blindly start doing reliability or TPM first, because you know what? You may find that a piece of equipment isnât necessary,â he says. âYou need to integrate the strategies â lean and reliability.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By raising the reliability of the essential, value-added processes, and dumping the waste, the dream result is being able to physically link processes together (as opposed to having disparate processes that lead to excess inventory, motion, work in progress and transportation). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âYou can link unreliable processes together, but I wouldnât recommend it,â says Billings. âIf you link four processes together that are each 80 percent efficient, 80 times 80 times 80 times 80 does not equal 80.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The overall process is instead 41 percent efficient, and an emergency waiting to happen. Raising the reliability of those four individual processes to, say, 95 percent increases the systemâs total efficiency to a more acceptable 81.5 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âAnytime you have unplanned maintenance, youâre affecting the whole plant, not just the area where you are. But as we head toward flow, that makes it even more important,â says Staley. âWhen you start linking processes together, a breakdown has a larger impact.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;KITS, KAIZEN AND SMALL-K &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Maryville plant has sought out waste in non-mechanical forms, as well. To eliminate waiting, motion and transportation and increase wrench time, the plant turned to the lean concept of kitting in the past two years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Instead of a mechanic making back-and-forth trips to the tool crib to get the parts, tools and materials needed to complete a work order (that walking distance adds up in a half-million-square-foot plant), that worker receives everything he or she needs to do the task in one convenient package. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn doing spaghetti charts (following movement through a process), the breakthrough comes when you break through the paper because you traced over it so many times,â says Billings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MRO tool crib attendants such as Deb Hayes and Donna Wilson receive a planned work order from the maintenance planner. The attendant goes through the crib and compiles everything that is needed and then stages it all in a tote, tub or (if the job is large) on a cart. When the job is ready, the planner is notified. The job is then scheduled. The mechanic who receives the work order goes to the crib once to receive the kit and then heads to the job site. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Plagens says concepts such as kitting have been instrumental in doubling wrench time over the past three years. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Waste reduction comes in many forms. Like many lean companies, Energizer is a heavy proponent of kaizen (continuous improvement) events. The battery maker has completed more than 800 weeklong kaizens which have contributed to more than $10 million in cost savings. It also is promoting small-k, short for small kaizen. These are simple, direct waste-elimination activities conducted by one or two workers. An Energizer plant in Indonesia is currently cranking out 500 documented small-k activities every month. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD class=subtitle borderColor=#ff0000 bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;LEAN LIVING&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Itâs been said that manufacturing professionals entrenched in lean activities think and see differently. Steve Hockridge, Energizerâs global lean enterprise director, good-naturedly says lean is both a cure and a curse. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI find myself thinking about lean constantly,â he says. âI go to places that arenât work-related, and if I see waste, it drives me crazy. I see it in the garage, in the restaurant. For a person like me who travels each week, going to an airport is an opportunity-rich environment for waste elimination.â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;VISIBLY CREATIVE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lean tools such as small-k serve to unlock the creativity of plant-floor workers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âCreativity is such a cornerstone and one that was masked by our traditional approach to things,â says Billings. âWhen people realized that itâs OK to think differently, that really opened the floodgates.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adds Plagens, âThe creativity to fix reoccurring problems is all in their hands. We want to generally increase the reliability on a machine or group of machines. What that group comes up with to get us there is up to them.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These ideas solve problems, increase reliability and make peopleâs jobs easier. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A glowing example is tucked in one corner of the building. This area was previously a repository for filled oil drums. These drums were stacked, waiting to be tapped and their contents used to lubricate machines. Few formal practices were in place at the time to store the drums or to tap and transport the oil to the floor. No filtering techniques were employed. The result was excess inventory, non-pure lubricants and an elevated risk of contamination. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Predictive maintenance analyst Clyde Henry developed the lean and reliable solution. He talked with vendors and viewed tons of catalogs. Drums of obsolete oil were removed, and excess drums of usable oil were transferred back to the supplier. Henry sketched and resketched models until he came up with the correct layout that would cleanly, safely and efficiently house the correct lubricants and related equipment. The repository became the lubricant management center. âWe want good, clean oil products going into our equipment,â says Henry. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe want to start from the inside out, making sure everything is clean and filtered, with no moisture or dirt, so that we can say that piece of equipment is running on 100 percent pure, clean oil. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe are now filtering the oil to 3 microns. We are filtering the water out before it goes into the equipment. We are putting oil in proper containers for our PM mechanics. We have a color-code system that is pretty fool-proof. We have color-coded our lubricant to the containers and to the machinery component itself. If itâs coded as yellow, it goes into our gearboxes, which also are marked in yellow. Itâs been a lot of work, but weâve come a long way in a yearâs time and really cleaned up this area.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Color-coding is just one of the visibility techniques used throughout the plant to heighten communication and eliminate miscommunication. Inspection points are numbered. Individual machine components are labeled. Gauges are taped to show proper and improper levels. Operators place tags on individual machine components to pinpoint problems (red tags) and opportunities for improvement (green tags). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200607_Cover-Story---Photo-4.jpg" width=350 border=1&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global maintenance manager Joe Plagens and tool crib &lt;BR&gt;attendant Deb Hayes examine a kitting project.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Visibility tools send messages to mechanics and operators, but they can also work simply to increase visibility. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The nail production area provides a perfect case in point. Each of the 15 machines is box-shaped, approximately 4 feet tall and stationed on the concrete floor. Originally, each of the machineâs four sides was solid sheet metal. You canât see through metal, so emerging problems such as an oil leak werenât noticed until the puddle meandered out from under the machine. If you needed to check or add oil to the lubrication system, the machine had to be shut down, locked out and a metal guard removed. The inside was dark, so a flashlight was always needed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The solutions were creative and plentiful. Mechanics installed Plexiglas doors on two sides of the machine. These allow mechanics and operators instant access to the interior. Permanent lighting was installed inside to provide visibility. Specially sized absorbent sheets were placed inside to not only catch oil drips but to visually convey that information to the operator or mechanic. And, the lubrication system was moved to the outside of the machine, so no shutdowns or lockouts are needed. Lubricant can be added on the fly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe can experiment,â says Piveral. âSometimes the idea doesnât work, but itâs no big deal. We just put it back to the way things were. Thatâs all part of it. Sometimes youâre right, sometimes youâre wrong, and if you were wrong, what did we learn from it. When it works, itâs tremendous. You know you had a hand in ensuring the reliability and performance of the machine.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;A TRUE 1 PERCENTER &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some manufacturing companies dabble with lean or fool themselves (and others) into believing that they are on the path. But there are other companies that are truly doing it the right way and making meaningful changes that allow their plants and their people to better face todayâs challenges and those of the future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are you in the 80 percent category or the 1 percent category? Itâs obvious where Energizer stands. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWeâve reduced the number of mechanics who fight fires or work reactively on the floor and increased the number who are focused on planned, predictive, preventive and proactive work,â says Staley. âWeâre using our resources in a different way and a lean way.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adds Tisone, âLooking back three years, where we were in all of our plants and where we are today, itâs 180 degrees different in terms of the ownership and the improvements weâve made in all processes. We have made great strides, but we have a long way to go. Lean is a journey; itâs not a destination. Thereâs never an end.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Like Energizerâs battery-powered bunny, it just keeps going and going. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE borderColor=#ff0000 cellPadding=5 width=450 align=center border=1&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD bgColor=#ff0000&gt;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle&gt;HOW DO YOU INCREASE CREATIVITY?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the socio-psychological studies are correct, your plant may have a problem with creativity. Energizerâs Steve Hockridge cited a recent research study that found only 5 percent of American adults are deemed creative, based on a standard evaluation measurement. The same study found 95 percent of pre-kindergarten children in the U.S. to be creative. The percentage plummets to 15 percent for first-graders. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhy is there such a gap?â says Hockridge. âThe explanation was tied to grades. Think about grades in school. What you are doing is grading people on how well they can tell back to you what you told them was the right answer. How much creativity are we encouraging by grading people based on that? âHere are the facts. Two weeks later, can you tell me what I told to you? If you can, youâre an A.â Thereâs no creativity there.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hockridge points to Toyota as a great example of a company pushing for creativity. âToyotaâs environment is completely creative,â he says. âThey encourage continuous experimentation. They encourage failure. Itâs all about learning and getting better.â&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>What constitutes world-class maintenance and reliability?</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;I have 
received many calls asking, "How can you tell if you are a world-class 
maintenance and reliability organization, or not?" &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;How 
well the systems and practices discussed in this column are being used indicate 
to me how far a plant has to go to become world class in the areas of 
maintenance and reliability. I would suggest reading this column with a group of 
operations and maintenance employees that includes both management and 
craftspeople. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;On a 
scale of zero to 10, rate your plant's use of the following systems and 
practices, with 10 meaning that you are so good that it would probably not pay 
off to do more improvements in this area. A 5 indicates that you feel you do a 
good job, while a zero means that your performance is a disaster. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;1) Assets 
are specified, designed and purchased based on life-cycle cost (LCC) instead of 
lowest cost to buy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that decisions 
on what to buy are based on costs to buy and costs to own an asset over its 
economical life, instead of buying assets solely on purchase price. A 
world-class organization has maintenance professionals involved very early in a 
project. These professionals know how to perform reliability and maintainability 
analyses of systems and components. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, complete bills of materials, training manuals and detailed drawings 
are delivered according to your documented maintenance standards. Also, guards 
allow easy inspections on the run, components requiring frequent maintenance are 
easily accessible, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;2) The 
management team is focusing on the same results.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; Operations, engineering, maintenance and stores are 
working toward the same goal. Your organization is jointly focusing on 
reliability performance, not on cutting costs until it sees what results it 
gets. This means that your whole organization's most important goal is 
competitiveness through manufacturing reliability and cost, rather than focusing 
only on maintenance costs and perceived maintenance downtime. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your overall production efficiency (OPE) continuously increases and, 
consequently, total manufacturing costs decrease. This is very important because 
increasing product throughput to sales generates three to 20 times more revenue 
in a normal market when compared with cutting costs for work done to generate 
the needed reliability for increasing product throughput. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;3) A 
reliability and maintenance policy has been developed and documented that 
includes a three- to five-year improvement plan.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;This policy is communicated to all employees. This means 
that you have described all essential reliability and maintenance elements, 
their key performance indicators, why these are important, how people are being 
recognized when improving toward goals, the importance of reliability for plant 
competitiveness, and so forth. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your employees are well-informed and motivated to do their part to 
continuously improve toward the same goals. People know which product line to 
prioritize because they know what the market demands. Work priorities are not 
based on emotions. Instead, they are based on what is best for the plant. There 
is a certainty of direction and a good understanding of what the future holds. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;4) 
Craftspeople have a high level of skills and front-line supervision adjusts its 
management style accordingly.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;This means that 
front-line supervisors, team leaders or coordinators do not need to spend much 
time instructing people. Instead, they support them through good planning and 
scheduling of work, identifying individual training needs, organizing this 
training, coaching root cause failure analysis, and other empowering tasks. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you have a thinking and problem-solving organization instead of a 
reactive one. People are enthusiastic about what they do. Their griping level is 
very low, and 10 to 30 percent of all maintenance hours, including crafts 
people's hours, are used on problem-solving and implementation of improvements. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;5) 
Maintenance crafts people's work is limited by their skills, not by rigid craft 
lines.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This means that you might have only one 
mechanical craft that includes welders, pipefitters, machinists, millwrights, 
etc., and another craft for electricians and instrumentation. However, to have 
this on a piece of paper is not worth anything. Your people are being trained to 
use all necessary skills, and supervisors are assigning work in a way that 
reflects your multiple skills or multi-craft work practices. At the same time, 
while you have work flexibility (horizontal skills), you still have vertical 
skills in areas such as hydraulics and electronics and other areas requiring 
specialists. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, you find it very easy to plan and schedule work because it involves less 
people to do a job that crosses over between traditional craft lines. Your 
crafts people's job satisfaction is also higher after the initial frustration 
created by the change you might have to go through to become more 
flexible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;6) The 
level of planning and scheduling is high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Whatever you call your maintenance program, and whatever 
improvement initiatives you implement, you will find that planning and 
scheduling are at the hub of cost-effective maintenance practices. Even programs 
like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
Reliability-Based Maintenance (RBM) or other three-letter acronyms for 
maintenance programs will soon discover this fact. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before you rate how 
well you think you plan and schedule, it is necessary to understand the basics 
of these concepts. First of all, planning can be described as all work you do in 
order to prepare for a job. These preparations include the final scope of work, 
safety requirements, major steps of work, important clearances, spare parts 
needed and secured as available for when the job is scheduled, special tools, 
scaffolding, skills required, time needed to do the job, and so forth. Secondly, 
scheduling means to decide when the job will be done and who will do it. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The following are some effective guidelines for planning and scheduling. 
When evaluating how well your mill plans and schedules, examine how well you 
follow these practices: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;A. 
Planning is done before scheduling. &lt;BR&gt;B. Planning and scheduling are done 
before execution of the work. &lt;BR&gt;C. Scheduling is done for the work that needs 
to be done. Then, you find and assign the right people to do the work. &lt;BR&gt;D. 
When executing a planned and scheduled job, people are not interrupted to do 
other work. &lt;BR&gt;E. A job is not finished before you have documented why the job 
had to be done. &lt;BR&gt;F. You later find the root cause of any identified problems. 
&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
you implement the above planning and scheduling practices, your results will 
show less use of outside contractors, less unscheduled overtime, increased 
overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), less unscheduled downtime and more free 
time to perform root cause failure analysis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;7) Work is correctly prioritized.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;To prioritize work correctly, you must realize the 
consequences of not doing the work before a given time. Consequences include 
environmental damage/personal injury, high costs for lost production, and/or 
maintenance and asset deterioration. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In 
a plant with multiple product lines, it is necessary, at any given time, to know 
which line is the most important to keep running in order to deliver to the 
customer on time. It is also important to know what the added value is for the 
product. In addition, it should be very difficult to add a job to a closed 
schedule at your mill. As a result, you will have very few changes in your 
weekly/daily and shutdown maintenance schedules. Disciplined priorities will 
also lead to correctly performing planning and scheduling tasks. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;8) Preventive maintenance (PM) and 
essential care and condition monitoring (ECCM) content are right.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt; To have the right content in your PM/ECCM program, you 
must base it on the consequences of not preventing the failure as mentioned in 
the previous section. Also, the consequence of a failure must be more 
"expensive" than the cost of trying to prevent it. &lt;BR&gt;The right content also 
includes using the right methods for basic inspections and condition monitoring. 
This means that you do not have "check," "inspect" or such as the only 
descriptions of inspections in your PM/ECCM program. Your methods and 
descriptions must be more precise. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most of your PM/ECCM should be done 
while equipment is operating. Very little should be done while equipment is not 
operating due to inspections, fixed-time maintenance overhauls and replacements, 
or other such tasks. Also, PM/ECCM frequencies should be based on failure 
developing time and failure distribution, according to results-oriented 
maintenance teachings. &lt;BR&gt;As a result, your PM/ECCM program will be very 
cost-effective. Also, you will do less PM/ECCM than before you implemented the 
above principles.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;9) PM/ECCM 
execution is 100 percent.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If you have the 
right content in your PM/ECCM program, there is no reason to have less than 100 
percent completion of the PM/ECCM you have implemented. Operators should be 
trained in essential care and inspections of equipment and should perform most 
of these activities when it is practical to do so. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, you will have very few, if any, unplanned and unscheduled maintenance 
events. More than half of the work you do during your shutdowns and in 
weekly/daily schedules will be as a result of your PM/ECCM program. This, in 
turn, will give you an opportunity to plan and then schedule more work. Also, a 
good PM/ECCM program is a prerequisite to good planning and scheduling of 
maintenance and, consequently, to increased overall equipment efficiency. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;10) Eighty-five percent of spare parts and 
materials are delivered to the job site.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If 
planning and scheduling are done correctly, the spare parts store will be in a 
position to effectively deliver spare parts and materials to the job site or to 
designated areas. Or, it will at least stage spare parts in, or close to, the 
store area. As a result, you will have very few people going to the store to get 
parts or waiting at the store window to get what they need. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=subtitle2&gt;11) Service level is 97 percent for the spare parts 
store.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;To maintain a necessary level of trust 
in your store system, the service level â getting the right part when you need 
it â must be very close to 97 percent. If it goes much below that level, people 
will lose trust in your store, and to survive, they will start building their 
own stores without the knowledge of the store's management. This could lead to 
the store's management falling under the false impression that they are doing 
very well in their efforts to reduce the store's inventory, causing them to 
continue their current practices. This will eventually lead to less trust in the 
store's ability to deliver what is needed when it is needed. As a result of good 
and cost-effective management of the spare parts store, you will see that the 
store's inventory value is decreasing with maintaining the service level. Also, 
there will be no unknown and undocumented store items in maintenance areas, 
offices, etc. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;12) The technical database is 
95 percent correct.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The technical database 
should always be up to date. Equipment, loop or electrical circuit identity 
should be the only thing needed to find and request or purchase spare parts or 
other information. As a result, no time is wasted in searching for store items 
or other information.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;13) The 
very basics of maintenance are instituted.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; I 
have mentioned many times before in this series of columns that the only major 
difference between the best performers and others is that the best performers 
implement what others only talk about. Best performers continuously work on 
improving the very basics of maintenance, while others often overlook them. Some 
of the maintenance basics include: &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Detailed cleaning of components &lt;BR&gt;â¢ 
Lubrication &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Alignment &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Balancing &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Filtration &lt;BR&gt;â¢ Operations 
practices. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleaning of components:&lt;/EM&gt; Detailed cleaning of 
components and equipment is often a âno manâs land.â Everybody agrees that it is 
important, but nobody wants to do it. In a world-class reliability and 
maintenance organization, components and equipment are cleaned in detail. Such 
an organization realizes that good inspections canât be done without this level 
of cleaning and that cleaning also extends the life of components. For example, 
the life of electric motors (electric life) varies between five months for a 
dirty motor and more than 20 years for a clean motor. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers also work on continuously 
improving lubrication. Their lubricators â because they do believe they need 
skilled lubricators â are trained in component wear criteria and required 
lubrication. Good lubrication must include such work as improving the choice of 
lubricant, method of lubrication, filtration of oil, cooling systems, prevention 
of water content and removal of water content. There are many examples of how 
this work results in significant life extension, lower lubrication costs and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Alignment and balancing:&lt;/EM&gt; Best 
performers have, and adhere to, alignment standards of, for example, 0.002 
inches or less parallel misalignment for an 8- to 10-inch-diameter coupling 
running at 1,500 rpm in most installations. Precision alignment and balancing of 
rotary assemblies results in reduced levels of vibration, longer component life, 
lower costs and increased equipment reliability. On average, a world-class value 
is 0.1 inches per second or lower. Several experts in this area have shown a 
strong correlation between low vibration level and high reliability and 
increased production throughput. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Filtration:&lt;/EM&gt; Filtration of 
hydraulic fluids, lubrication systems and seal water for mechanical seals is 
very important. In most cases, standard filters are not good enough. If you use 
filters that filter out particles smaller than 5 microns (0.0002 inches), you 
will have much fewer problems with leaking hydraulics, bearings and mechanical 
seals. For example, hydraulics will not leak, bearing life will be extended by 
up to four times and the average life of mechanical seals will be more than 
eight years. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Operations practices:&lt;/EM&gt; Best performers teach the 
operators essential care and inspection of components and equipment. This 
includes how to start up and shut down processes and equipment without causing 
any damage. In many mills, it is not uncommon that equipment fails because a 
steam system was started up too fast, causing equipment failures because of 
water hammer and thermal stresses, mechanical seal failure because pumps were 
started up before seal water was turned on to the seals, and so 
forth.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;14) Safety 
standards are very high.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Without having enough 
statistical data to make this a proven fact, I am convinced that there is a 
strong relationship between good maintenance practices and a millâs safety 
performance. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;The 
average OIR (OSHA Incident Rate = incidents per 200,000 working hours) for the 
U.S. pulp and paper industry is about 8.5, though below 2 is considered good. 
Even given the fact that OIR reporting disciplines differ between mills, a mill 
with a low rating is doing something different than the average mill. Three 
things they do better are maintenance prevention, preventive maintenance, and 
planning and scheduling. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;15) 
Front-line supervision supervises many crafts.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;A good organization needs good supervisors. However, the 
role and management style of a supervisor must change with the skill level of 
their craftspeople. To be effective, systems and procedures must be instituted 
to support the supervisor and the team of craftspeople. If your millâs 
craftspeople have a high level of skills, they do not need detailed technical 
instruction. Instead, they need support in the form of priorities, planning and 
scheduling. Both craftspeople and supervisors must realize that people skills 
are more important than technical skills. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As 
a result, your mill will see good teamwork, motivated people and high working 
morale. People will also have more time to work on problem-solving and to 
eliminate sources of failure. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;16) 
Individual training plans are developed and used.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a result of a crafts skills analysis, your mill will 
have individual training plans for each craftsperson and supervisor. Your 
training is than very focused and cost-effective. You measure training by 
increased skill levels, not by the number of training hours. In addition, your 
mill very rarely lacks the skills to do a proficient job. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;17) You 
incorporate root cause failure analysis.&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Your 
mill has established a reliability group as task forces or as a separate 
function. You know which problems you should work on, by priority, and you are 
continuously designing out problems. Key people are trained in FMEA (failure 
mode and effects analysis) methodologies and are using these skills to solve 
operations and equipment problems. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;In a 
bigger maintenance organization, you have a separate reliability group. Because 
problems are a combination of equipment, operations, people and other factors, 
this group might not report to operations or maintenance but to the mill manager 
or independent engineering manager. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;As a 
result, your mill has continuously fewer problems. You do not discuss increasing 
your preventive maintenance efforts, but instead you decrease (optimize) 
predictive maintenance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;18) You 
make full use of time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt; This column includes a 
table that describes the typical, good, and world-class distribution and use of 
time in a maintenance department. If you take some time to study the figures in 
the table and compare them to how your maintenance department honestly uses its 
time, you might be in for a surprise. Before you do this, however, it is 
necessary to go through the definitions for the categories of work used in the 
table. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Daily and weekly work means all work you can 
do independently, whether or not the process is in operation. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Shutdown is all work that requires the 
process to be down in order to do a safe job. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only planned work is for all work executed 
after it has been planned, though it has not been scheduled. In a pulp mill with 
a continuous digester, or for a paper machine and other processes that are 
difficult to start and stop, this category of work is less common than in a 
packaging or finishing area where there are many minor stops and it is easy to 
stop and start equipment. However, it is still very cost-effective to use this 
category where applicable. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Only scheduled work is for all work executed 
as scheduled before it has been planned. You can say that you have turned the 
planning and scheduling process upside down. If you do it correctly, however, 
you plan before you schedule. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; â¢ Break-in work is all work that is added to 
the schedule after it was closed. Closing time for a schedule is recommended to 
be about 19 hours in advance of execution for daily and weekly work. Closing 
time is about one week for shorter shutdowns (10 to 12 hours) and four weeks for 
a longer shutdown (over five days). &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Many 
readers of this column have e-mailed me with questions concerning a typical 
evaluation average. Perhaps this question is coming up because you find that 
your millâs ratings are low. We have done more than 250 similar evaluations in 
mills worldwide and the average in most mills is between 4 and 5. Best mills 
rank above 6, and very few are above 7. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT 
class=bodytextspaced&gt;Hopefully, this gives you some encouragement. If you rated 
yourselves above 6, you are either very good, or you might be overly optimistic 
or unaware of your actual performance. Remember that we demanded no fewer than 
50 percent crafts people to participate in the evaluations that resulted in the 
above averages. If only management does the evaluation, ratings tend to be 
higher. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
