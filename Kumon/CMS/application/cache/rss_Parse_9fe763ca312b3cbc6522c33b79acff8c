            <title>Basic Principles of Ultrasonic Testing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The basic principles of ultrasonic testing involve the propagation and reflection of sound waves. This 8-minute, 14-second video shows how defects and abnormalities can be detected using the pulse-echo method. Watch animations of longitudinal sound waves propagated and reflected through a cylindrical workpiece as well as an actual ultrasonic inspection of a wheel axle to gain a better understanding of this type of nondestructive testing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Detect Compressed Air Leaks</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/21/026485f4-ca4f-4836-a5ca-da3ce2067283_Compressed air image-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 275px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Compared to water, electricity and gas, pneumatic processes are a necessary utility and an important source of converted energy that has been in use long before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;#39;s modern industrial operations, few processes rank higher in terms of importance than compressed air, and no process places a higher demand on energy consumption. As a key utility, its uses include running machinery, conveyance in handling systems, and switching for instrumentation and electrical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, energy demand is negatively impacted when poor maintenance practices allow inefficiencies to spiral out of control. The single biggest culprit is system leaks. Today&amp;#39;s compressed air systems are obviously more complex than those from ancient times and hopefully more efficient. It makes you wonder how the Greeks dealt with leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below is a simple breakdown of a typical investment a company would need to make for a simple compressed air system. The chart reveals that energy accounts for as much as 75 percent of the total system cost. It&amp;#39;s a surprising statistic, as conventional logic would have us believe that upfront capital costs and ongoing maintenance costs should dominate. While capital costs for compressors and delivery systems are significant, they are not ongoing. If a system is specified correctly and maintained well over time, its capital costs can be depreciated. A poorly maintained and leaking system will continually drain resources, have a negative impact on energy and never fulfill demand. An inefficient, energy-wasting system further hurts the environment through additional and unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/21/73a984fb-115a-4fa2-bbf9-7b69918a6628_Compressed air graphic.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 207px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact that most people don&amp;rsquo;t always think of compressed air in terms of energy consumption explains why so little attention is given to finding and fixing leaks. Leaks are expensive. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, average systems waste between 25 and 35 percent of their air to leaks alone. In a 1,000-standard-cubic-feet-per-minute (SCFM) system, 30 percent leakage translates to 300 SCFM. Eliminating that leak is the equivalent of saving more than $45,000 annually. Depending on your plant&amp;#39;s location and your region&amp;#39;s energy costs, the amount saved can be three to four times higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A better understanding of leak complacency is needed to get to the core of the problem. Why do people pay more attention to energy-efficient lighting and continue to ignore inefficient compressed air systems? One explanation is that compressed air leaks are not seen. I grew up listening to my parents say, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t leave the lights on,&amp;quot; so efficient lighting was ingrained in me at an early age. They never said much about leaks, yet I can still recall leaking air lines in my father&amp;#39;s workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the factory setting, a steam leak is obvious and an oil leak even more so, but air leaks don&amp;#39;t create a visible plume, nor do they make a dangerous and slippery mess on the floor. They don&amp;#39;t have an unpleasant odor, and their continual hissing is generally not heard or ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So is it truly a case of &amp;quot;out of sight, out of mind?&amp;quot; Is energy waste and system inefficiency still a low priority for manufacturers? Could it be that compressed air is a background process taken for granted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider your compressed air system and all the areas where pneumatics are employed at your facility. Expand your thinking beyond the factory walls where compressed air makes possible many things in science, technology and everyday living. From jackhammers for road repairs and drills in the dentist&amp;#39;s chair to the tires that roll us to work, school and play, compressed air is all around us &amp;hellip; and yes, it is taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A culture change is occurring in industry where it&amp;#39;s needed most. Industry represents the biggest consumer and therefore the largest potential gain. It is a dual challenge and a dual opportunity. The challenge is to invest in more efficient energy and environmentally conscious practices. The opportunity is to improve profitability and slow the effects of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is an insatiable thirst for electricity, and the fossil fuels necessary to quench this thirst are being used up at rates we cannot afford. Two concerning side effects are the diminished supply of non-renewable fuel sources and the effect that increased levels of carbon dioxide have on global climate change. Diminished supply means continued higher energy costs, while global climate change represents something much more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all companies are sitting idly by waiting for others to take action. Many have already begun programs that address energy efficiency and specifically target the compressed air system. AFG Glass is the second largest flat glass manufacturer in North America and the largest supplier to the construction and specialty glass market. Founded in 1978, AFG is headquartered in Kingsport, Tenn. With its three divisions, it is a fully integrated supplier. One division is responsible for flat glass manufacturing, another for advanced energy-efficient coatings and a third fabrication division adds value to the finished product through tempering, laminating and insulating. In total, AFG has nine glass production operations, 34 fabrication/distribution centers, four sputter coating lines, five insulating plants and one laminating facility. They have more than 4,800 employees working in their North American operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of AFG&amp;#39;s manufacturing divisions implemented airborne ultrasound programs in 2006. Ultrasound was considered for its reputation as an overall predictive maintenance and troubleshooting tool. When several technicians attended ultrasound certification training, they learned the technology they invested in would be used for much more than troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic leak detectors work like simple microphones that are sensitive to high-frequency sounds ranging beyond the human ear. Early detectors enabled problems with machinery to be heard on the factory floor regardless of background noise. As the technology has grown up, so has its form and function. Today&amp;#39;s ultrasound detectors can be simple leak detectors or advanced data collectors capable of trending and diagnosing machine failures and plant inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound detectors use a sensitive piezoelectric crystal element as a sensing element. Small high-frequency sound waves excite or &amp;quot;flex&amp;quot; the crystal, creating an electrical pulse, which is amplified and then translated into an audible frequency that an ultrasound inspector can hear through high-quality noise-attenuating headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a leak passes from a high to a low pressure, it creates turbulence. The turbulence generates a high-frequency sound component, which is detected by the crystal element. Higher frequency sounds are directional by nature. By detecting only the ultrasound component of a turbulent leak, the technician is able to quickly guide the instrument to the loudest point and pinpoint the leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A typical compressed air system can be surveyed for leaks in one or two days. Larger plants may take longer, but the benefits to finding and fixing leaks are well worth the investment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several ultrasonic detectors use parabolic reflectors or elliptical reflectors to enhance and concentrate the leak signal, which can be useful when detecting small leaks or scanning at a great distance. Imagine scanning all the overhead piping without ever climbing a ladder or scissor lift. Parabolic accessories are key to enhanced productivity and operator safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Douglas Bowker is the plant maintenance superintendent at AFG Industries&amp;#39; plant in Greenland, Tenn. He has been instrumental in the implementation of ultrasound testing to improve the well-being of his plant&amp;#39;s equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Compressed air is not free,&amp;quot; Bowker says. &amp;quot;It costs Greenland approximately $137,000 per year to supply compressed air to the plant. Air leaks therefore cost us money. A small leak that is undetected by the human ear can typically contribute to $3,000 of cost per year. The ultrasonic equipment can now be utilized in a cost-saving manner to detect such leaks and fix them proactively.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Douglas is quick to add that an air leak the size of a pinhole can be detected from a distance of 40 feet. In addition, his technicians can detect natural gas, nitrogen and hydrogen leaks. The ultrasound equipment is also useful in detecting leaky or malfunctioning valves and can help detect flow in pipelines from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/ultrasonic_inspection/~4/RV9ovN9ABoE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Inspecting Reciprocating Compressors with Ultrasound</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who has benefitted from the advancements made in ultrasound testing will agree that this technology is no longer just for leak testing. It is a complimentary companion technology to vibration analysis, infrared imaging, motor-circuit testing and oil analysis. Some will assert that the foundation of any predictive maintenance program should be based on ultrasound first due partly to its versatility, low cost and easy implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nowadays, meeting reliability professionals who still believe in archaic methods for detection of machine faults is rare. That&amp;#39;s why it was surprising to read Dan Wise&amp;#39;s technical paper, &amp;quot;Knocking Compressor? All you really need is a screwdriver to find the source of the problem.&amp;quot; His message compelled me to climb back on my soapbox and scream, &amp;quot;You need ultrasound!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety should be taken very seriously. Inspector training is as much about safety as it is about procedure, so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to look past the obvious hazards that could come from sticking a greasy screwdriver in your ear and then placing the other end against a knocking compressor valve. It is also difficult to ignore the added risk of working in a noisy compressor room without wearing approved safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wise&amp;#39;s paper suggests that ultrasound is unnecessary because the technology &amp;quot;takes time to learn.&amp;quot; Instead, he urges inspectors to develop their skills with a screwdriver &amp;quot;by spending time, each day, paying attention to the sounds of compressors.&amp;quot; His advice is conflicting. Are we better to spend time each day learning his &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; screwdriver technique, or are we better off to spend our time learning how to use an ultrasound instrument that can do so much more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-right: 20px; float: left;"&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;

		valves with an ultrasonic data collector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For more than 20 years, ultrasound has been providing early warning signals for mechanical failure. If you can hear compressor valves knocking with a screwdriver, you are too late. However, there is a fundamental difference in philosophy between what ultrasound inspection proposes to accomplish and what is hoped to be achieved with a screwdriver. Ultrasound monitors the condition of that compressor valve from the time it is new until the time it is ready to be replaced, all the while providing feedback about subtle changes in its operational condition. The screwdriver method is used &amp;quot;to find the source of the problem,&amp;quot; which suggests the knocking is already perceivable to the human ear and it is only a matter of days, hours or minutes before the compressor will fail. I call this firefighting. It is certainly not condition-based monitoring, and it leaves no room for planning the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The paper warns that &amp;quot;valves can break without warning for a variety of reasons&amp;quot; and goes on to list some common causes for failure. The real reason machine systems fail &amp;quot;without warning&amp;quot; is because no warning system is in place. Using a predictive technology such as ultrasound condition-based monitoring to indicate subtle changes in machines over time allows industry to avoid firefighting catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Advanced Valve Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A huge benefit of ultrasound is its ability to record dynamic wave files on reciprocating compressors. Using simple time waveform analysis software, it is easy to expand 1/10th or even 1/100th of a second of data to see a valve open, exhaust and close. During that blink of an eye, you can see if there is complete sealing of the valve seat and can even assess the strength of the valve spring. All of this data can be printed in a logical report, which serves as a summary for management to decide if further action is necessary. Because the document becomes a historical archive, the next decision will have a basis of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reciprocating compressors contain one or more cylinders that compress gases. A simplified example is shown in Figure 1. Pistons travel up and down within the cylinder. On the downstroke, new gas is drawn into the cylinder through an inlet valve. On the upstroke, gas already trapped in the cylinder is compressed and pushed through an outlet valve to a receiver or tank. In this example, a vacuum pulls the outlet valve closed and the inlet valve open, while pressure does the opposite. In more complex reciprocating compressors, more robust valves operate with springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Opportunities for failure are many. Seal integrity around the piston cylinder wall reduces the efficiency of compression. Dirty and worn valves do not seat properly due to corrosion and buildup around the valve head. Internal leakage around the piston and valve head can be detected with ultrasound inspection by recording a dynamic ultrasound signal and analyzing it over time. Early mechanical failures, which can eventually lead to screwdriver-detectable valve-knocking, can be seen this way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Figure 2, you can see the impact made by the valve when it is seated and the suction of turbulent air flow when the valve is opened. High amplitude signals between the valve impacts can reveal mechanical looseness (early knocking) or internal leakage from piston rings or the valve seat. A comparison of similar valves can be made easily by scaling the Y-axis of the time signal and presenting it in overlay or side-by-side mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A documented report that cites the historical evolution of your compressor&amp;#39;s health can be an extremely valuable and professional way to present your data. It is a great tool for conveying to maintenance managers that a problem is escalating and that action is required. It will hold much more credibility than walking into your boss&amp;#39;s office with grease dripping from your ear and suggesting that a compressor valve sounds like a &amp;quot;bongo drum&amp;quot; and should immediately be removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is no substitution for walking the plant floor and visually taking account of the state of affairs. Much can be learned by talking with operators. Operators have the best pulse for machine condition because they work around them every day. For those who are ready to take the next step (implementation of a condition-based monitoring program), getting to know the expectations of operations, management and front-line staff is the best approach. From that point, defining the assets that need the most critical monitoring will be as an important of a step as figuring out which technologies should be used to collect the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Documentation is the final piece of the puzzle. Without it, all other initiatives are pointless. Needless to say, modern techniques for collecting data that can be trended and reported are preferred over archaic methods that rely on individual interpretation and old-school tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasound Detection: Predictive Maintenance for the Masses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The popularity of ultrasound inspection for maintenance and reliability managers is attributed to ease of use, versatility and low implementation cost. Once considered a companion to core predictive technologies like vibration analysis and infrared imaging, the emergence of standalone ultrasound inspection programs is more prevalent for reliability departments today. Ultrasound is now considered a front-line defense system in the everyday battle for manufacturing uptime. Airborne ultrasound is predictive maintenance for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mass Appeal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The applications in which ultrasonic technology can be used are nearly limitless, lending to its mass appeal. Compressed air leak detection, condition-based monitoring of bearings and acoustic lubrication of bearings are popular applications. Some inspectors monitor thousands of steam traps and pinpoint in-leakage to boilers, condensers and heat exchangers. Others marry ultrasonic inspection and infrared scanning together for added safety to motor control center panel scans or surveys of high-voltage substations and transmission and distribution lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Easy to Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound instruments have always been considered user friendly. Being painted this way left consumers with the impression that user-friendliness equated to lacking sophistication. Nothing could be further from the truth for the new generation of instruments. Inspectors can literally design their own instrument to suite their program&amp;#39;s needs and goals, and flexibly change that instrument as their program evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/2a683bc8-5013-44db-a77b-acf61c831247_1c.jpeg" style="width: 175px; height: 403px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Most detectors work on the basic principle of detecting high-frequency ultrasound and converting it to corresponding audible sounds, which can be listened to with headphones. Additional functions are dependent of the device, but most provide a visual indicator on a bar graph display or a decibel measurement. Some can even capture a time-specified wave signal that can be analyzed with software. Adding sophistication while maintaining simplicity is a challenge that some manufacturers handle better than others, but the net effect is driving the popularity of this technology to mainstream predictive maintenance (PdM) practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic analysis offers benefits for all areas of the manufacturing process. Most machine failures could be discovered early, making them treatable issues instead of replaceable downtime issues. Excessive vibration and temperature increases are indicators of mechanical failure on the horizon, but we also learned that microscopic changes in friction forces, detectable early with ultrasound, provide a bigger window of opportunity for scheduled maintenance. When you hear problems this soon, you are empowered with the ability to limit downtime and overall maintenance cost. Following are some of the most common maintenance applications for airborne ultrasound that can be applied at plants today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Compressed Air Leak Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/a4a9baf2-2d7c-4b4c-8d3a-979afb62b4f9_2c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 317px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Compressed air is one of the most expensive utilities used in manufacturing. Leaks are expensive and often ignored. While they can be heard with the naked ear, they are difficult to pinpoint because of background noise. An ultrasonic detector hears leak turbulence through the ambient noise of the factory floor no matter what. The high-frequency component of a leak is directional, making it fast and easy to locate its source. A compressed air survey with an ultrasonic detector once per quarter will reveal savings potential in the millions and benefit plant managers looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Condition Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One application that has evolved alongside the new generation of detectors is condition-based monitoring (CBM) of rotating and non-rotating equipment. In both instances, production machines produce frictional forces with high-frequency ultrasonic signatures. These forces are often masked by ambient plant noise and low-frequency vibrations. Changes in these signatures serve as early indicators of failure and provide comparative information for vibration data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You want to believe that the majority of your machines are not in an advanced failure condition. Would you rather spend days analyzing gigabytes of data from machines that are not failing or use ultrasound technology to sort the good from the bad so your vibration analysts are focused only on trouble areas? The answer is obvious and reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic instrument equipped with digital decibel-metering measures and logs the intensity of high-frequency frictional forces. Enhanced detectors also capture time signals alongside the decibel measurement. Time signals are useful for slow-speed bearing condition assessment, which is one area where vibration analysis struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/48261632-c29d-4303-b8d2-9abf14caa585_3c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 197px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Condition monitoring with ultrasound provides overall data that is indicative of elevated friction levels from random impacting, rubbing and spalling. These non-sinusoidal events are more interesting to analyze in the time domain, making ultrasonic monitoring useful as a first line of defense instrument. Collecting information is quick and inexpensive. Much more data can be taken, extending condition monitoring to more machines that may have been overlooked by vibration due to time and costs. Ultrasonic monitoring will detect a change earlier in the fault cycle than other technologies. For this reason, ultrasound is generally used to alert changes in condition and for a preliminary diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Acoustic Condition-Based Lubrication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time lubrication breaks down, and the friction forces inherent in any bearing increase. Ultrasonic systems that measure decibel-microvolt levels monitor and predict the relevant need for regreasing of the bearing. When a baseline ultrasonic alarm is compromised, a lubricator is alerted to the problem and can correct it before the bearing is physically damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/3a443189-207f-43dd-8efc-af1da1d1f30e_4c.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 276px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Condition-based lubrication monitoring advises lube techs when grease is needed and warns them when too much grease is added. One problem with adding too much grease is compromised seals. For electric motor bearings, this means grease pushed through the seal and into the windings. One U.S. paper mill decided to stop greasing motor bearings altogether since it was cheaper to replace the bearing instead of cleaning out piles of grease from the motor. This technique has become the norm for establishing lubrication requirements on most production machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Electrical Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The versatility of ultrasonic inspections extends to the electrical maintenance department where routine scans of switchgear, substations and high kilovolt transmission and distribution lines are commonplace. There is mounting concern about safety, specifically the danger of arc flash. Prior to opening high and medium voltage electric panels, inspectors use ultrasound detection to listen to the levels of ultrasound inside the cabinet. The importance of finding problems at an ultrasonic level can&amp;#39;t be overemphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/d157f61c-5c9a-4a1c-924b-1f1d997c210d_5c.jpeg" style="width: 220px; height: 220px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Radio and TV interference are common complaints from local cable companies. Often the source can be traced to a faulty transformer or a failed lightning arrestor. Pinpointing the culprit is quick and simple with an ultrasonic scan. The directional nature of ultrasound focused on a parabola reveals problems from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Steam System Inspections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A steam trap is an automatic valve that opens for condensate and non-condensable gases and closes for steam. It is designed to trap and remove water, air and carbon dioxide, which hinder the efficient transfer of steam, corrode system components and cause damaging water hammer. Ultrasonic surveys of the entire steam system will reveal system leaks, blockages, stuck valves and failed traps. Increasing steam efficiency translates to huge dollar savings and increased product quality. Certain types of traps can benefit from dynamic signal analysis. When monitoring continuous traps, it can be difficult to discern between live steam from a failed trap and flash steam, which is produced when the reduced pressure of the condensate line causes condensate to regenerate back to steam. Viewing the time signal of suspect traps can help distinguish between flash and live steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pump Cavitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cavitation is the result of a pump being asked to do something beyond its specification. Small cavities of air develop behind the vanes. These pockets have a destructive effect on the pump&amp;#39;s internal components. During normal data collection, inspectors use ultrasonic detectors to isolate random cavitation, which can be masked by low-frequency modulations. By using an ultrasonic detector in contact mode, you can isolate the pump vanes and listen for small air pocket explosions. Place the contact probe on the housing of the pump vane and adjust amplification to filter down shaft noise. With some experience, an operator will quickly be able to identify when pump cavitation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reciprocating Compressors and Valves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reciprocating valves give breath to compressors. Worn or dirty valves can&amp;#39;t seat properly. Over time springs weaken, limiting the force necessary to snap open and closed, which causes leakage. Valve condition is monitored with ultrasound inspection and spectral analysis software. The demodulated signal from the detector is fed directly to an analyzer or stored as a wave file. Spectra graphs visualize the compressor valve as it opens and closes, as well as intakes and exhausts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/25c7d2b6-7d87-48e4-bf0a-cf847789bc0d_6c.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 192px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Visualizing the recorded sound file of a compressor valve can tell you a lot about the condition of the valves and their components. Valves are opened and closed by a spring mechanism, allowing reciprocating compressors to intake and exhaust. The three distinct events (open, intake or exhaust, and close) all occur at split-second timing that is too fast for the naked ear to process. By viewing the wave file in real time, you can stretch this out to visualize each individual event. Time wave images can also be saved and compared over time to see the evolution of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Heat Exchanger and Condenser Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tube condensers and heat exchangers cool steam, which condenses back to purified water and is returned to a boiler where it is superheated back to steam. Leaks in the tube allow contaminants in, opening the door for corrosion and reduced operating life. Keeping the water pure is the key to efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/7/67fecff1-ae5a-4aac-a820-526f46242b58_7c.jpeg" style="width: 230px; height: 173px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The general method of inspection involves scanning with the instrument a couple feet from the tube sheet. If a noisy area is found, it is noted. However, if you switch to an extended flexible sensor, you can scan tube to tube. If the sound signal on the digital decibel-microvolt meter or the sound in the headset does not change from tube to tube, a leak is unlikely. This is particularly true of tubes located on the outer edges of the tube sheet, as these tubes are more likely to have noisy steam flowing over their outer diameter surfaces. If a significant signal change occurs, then a leak is suspected. If the leak is within the tube, the difference will be heard at the tube opening. If the noise level is heard on the tube sheet, block the area to eliminate reflected noise, then place a rubber precision tip with an opening of 1/8 inch on the flexible extended sensor and hold it almost on the tube sheet surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Valves and Hydraulic Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time small leaks, blockages and bypassing will manifest inside hydraulic systems. The sources of these faults are detectable with ultrasonic inspection. Hydraulic oil will form small bubbles, which pop as they are forced across seals and wipers. With a magnetic or contact sensor placed against the housing, you can set the sensitivity to the maximum level to reveal the tiny explosions. The signatures from a passing hydraulic valve can be a steady rushing sound or an intermittent gurgle. Comparing similar areas in the system to trace blockages and passing will save hours of visual inspection and teardown time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Where Do We Go From Here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic inspection, detection and data collection have been around for more than 35 years but only recently have gained acceptance in predictive maintenance departments. Branded as &amp;quot;ultrasonic leak detection,&amp;quot; this technology has shed its type-cast role to become a versatile, important and dynamic member of the predictive family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beware of the technology trap. Buying the latest and greatest gadgets, even the useful ones like ultrasound, will only take you so far. For a successful and long-lasting ultrasound inspection program, be prepared to invest in a program implementation specialist to help you establish your goals, plan for the execution of those goals and institute a means to measure the progress of your program as the benefits start rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/ultrasonic_inspection/~4/8rI-1QcoDuE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Spectronics Unveils New Ultrasonic Diagnostic Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/3/4b487c90-6acf-4ab2-9000-a3c935d39191_MDE-2000 Marksman II for web.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 246px; float: left;" /&gt;Spectronics Corporation recently introduced a new ultrasonic diagnostic tool that converts and amplifies inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; sound. The MDE-2000 Marksman II allows a technician to &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; even the smallest compressed air, natural gas, propane tank, vacuum, steam and other pressurized leaks before they lead to major breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tool uses a two-tiered approach to ensure accurate diagnosis. The receiver converts inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible sound using heterodyne circuitry. The unique Sound Signature Technology then fine-tunes the audible sound into the natural sound emitted by the leak itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 5-LED signal intensity indicator and audible alarm pinpoint the exact source of the problem. An Internal Noise Control (INC) feature safeguards against ambient noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Marksman II comes with an ultrasonic receiver, full-sized headphones, a hollow air probe, a solid contact probe and an ultrasonic emitter that helps locate faulty seals, gaskets and weatherstripping in doors, windows, ductwork and other non-pressurized enclosures. All components are packed in a sturdy carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also offers a MDE-2000NC Marksman II model, which is equipped with heavy-duty, noise-canceling headphones for extremely noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasound World VIII to be Held in Florida</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound World, a forum for ultrasound technology, has been scheduled for May 14-17, 2012, at the Clearwater Hilton in Clearwater Beach, Fla. Entering its eighth year, Ultrasound World has grown into one of the top conferences for reliability and energy conservation. This year&amp;rsquo;s program will feature presentations and short courses by users of ultrasound technology and will cover a wide range of topics for condition monitoring and energy conservation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the presentations offered include &amp;ldquo;No More Equipment Failures! Can You Say That?&amp;rdquo; by Todd Fraser of Procter and Gamble, who will describe how his department dramatically reduced bearing failure incidents using ultrasound technology. The short course &amp;ldquo;Clean, Green and Reliable&amp;rdquo; will explain how equipment reliability delivers low-cost, energy-efficient assets at plants around the world. Other important topics, such as effective energy conservation practices and detecting and analyzing electrical fault conditions with ultrasound, will also be covered in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>UE Secures Patent for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	UE Systems recently announced a new patented method of calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions in plant leaks. The emissions readings are now installed as part of the company&amp;rsquo;s Ultratrend data-management software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This patent adds a great deal of new value, customization and capability to the already industry-leading Ultratrend DMS,&amp;rdquo; says Doug Waetjen, Global Operations for UE Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with providing compressed air leak information, the Ultratrend DMS can now create reports that also break down gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide. The greenhouse gas data measurements are based on state electricity profiles by the Energy Information Administration; Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternative Fuels; and the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traditionally, when taking a comprehensive leak detection survey, all data collected from using one of UE Systems&amp;rsquo; digital instruments is downloaded to the Ultratrend DMS, which filters the data and allows the user to set up a report on an Excel spreadsheet. The survey allows the user to store information in each tested group location, converting the decibel levels of each leak into CFM measurement, which is used to calculate both the cost of a leak and the amount of greenhouse gases generated by producing the electricity used to compress the air that is wasted. In addition to greenhouse gases, the software is also used for other gases such as compressed air, argon, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motivating factor behind creating and implementing a compressed gas report is to assist reporting of compressed air leaks, which is one of the most costly utilities found at plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ultratrend DMS report offers a detailed monthly survey of data, a global annualized summary of leak volume and potential cost savings once fixed. Monthly data provides details for each leak, including location, size, the identified cost, the identified energy avoidance and the identified amount of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide. Users receive a report offering the identification of specific leaks repaired, the actualized cost saved and the actualized greenhouse gas savings for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;By being able to view unrepaired leaks in a report, users can manage the repair process to assure that the savings from a survey are realized,&amp;rdquo; says Waetjen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through prompts on the spreadsheet, users can adjust the cost factors for their geographic area and make shifts depending upon whether the plant is operational 24 hours a day or less. With the patented technology, users also can now change their greenhouse gas usage numbers based on their region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited about this new technology, both from a cost-savings and planet-saving perspective,&amp;rdquo; says Waetjen.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Study Confirms Accuracy of UE Leak Detectors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	UE Systems announces a major step in independently verifying the accuracy of its UE3000 leak detectors to estimate compressed air leak flows. Gary Mohr, President of UE Systems, explains, &amp;ldquo;We always felt that our leak detector did a good job estimating the size of air leaks by using our ultrasonic intensity measurement approach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;But to find out that Air Power USA, one of the most highly regarded and experienced compressed air consulting groups in the country, had taken it upon themselves to run head-to-head comparisons of air flow estimates made using our UE3000 system and Air Power&amp;rsquo;s own engineering- and experience-based approach was gratifying.&amp;nbsp; Air Power&amp;rsquo;s study results concluded the two approaches came within 5 percent of each other in the aggregate estimate of air flows for five different air studies. Having the difference in the size estimate of any individual leak usually fall within 2 cfm is truly amazing and great news for our customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hank van Ormer, president of Air Power USA, explains the unusual effort by his company, &amp;ldquo;Over 70 percent of our business is &amp;lsquo;performance-based,&amp;rsquo; which means we only get paid to the extent we deliver energy savings that can be verified by an independent evaluator. As such, we have greatly increased our measurement capabilities so we know which customer projects will produce the payback we need and whether the independent evaluation is on target.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have always taken pride in our in-house training for our senior air auditors and air specialists to quantify leak flows. In a number of cases, Air Power has reviewed leak estimates made by our competitors, where we have found that our flow estimates were less than half for the very same leaks. We feel vindicated when the post-project flow measurements associated with those leaks confirm our original estimates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With the UE3000 system, we can now get that same level of accuracy faster and at a lower cost. In addition, the repeatability of the UE3000 flow estimates is an important bonus that provides credibility when we have independent evaluators checking our work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information about the UE3000 leak detection system can be obtained from UE Systems Inc. at 800-223-1325 or Info@uesystems.com.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Diagnosing a boiler pump motor with an ultrasound detector</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In this video, a maintenance&amp;nbsp;technician uses the UL101, an ultrasound detector, to diagnose a thrust and non-thrust bearing in an injector boiler pump motor. He places the UL101 on the grease fitting and adjusts the UL101&amp;#39;s gain to the lowest possible setting. Lowering the gain setting will isolate the ultrasound to only the bearing being tested. Maintenance teams use the UL101, ultrasound detector, for quick troubleshooting on mechanical components.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Using ultrasound to scan the integrity of gold bars</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Gold prices have &lt;a href="http://www.goldalert.com/2010/11/gold-price-awaits-bernanke-fed-and-qe2/" jquery1288809415265="8"&gt;jumped more than 16 percent&lt;/a&gt; since August, with the price per ounce now a whopping $1,358 &amp;mdash; and some are already predicting &lt;a href="http://goldmoney.com/gold-research/gold-expected-to-climb-much-higher.html" jquery1288809415265="9"&gt;we&amp;rsquo;ll hit&lt;/a&gt; $2,500 per ounce in two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With so much money flowing into gold, the industry is looking for new ways to not only ensure the integrity of the supply, but also to give new buyers peace of mind that their purchases are secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest providers of physical bullion, United Kingdom-based GoldMoney, is now putting GE&amp;rsquo;s ultrasound technology to work doing just that &amp;mdash; by scanning every one of its gold bars. It&amp;rsquo;s the same type of scan used to peer at babies in the womb, railroad tracks under stress, or wear and tear on jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GoldMoney buys gold, silver and platinum online and it then stores it for its customers in specialized bullion vaults in London, Zurich, and Hong Kong. While they already have steps to check the integrity of their bars, the new scans using GE&amp;rsquo;s flaw detector &amp;mdash; which is called a Phasor XS and is made by &lt;a href="http://www.gesensinginspection.com/" jquery1288809415265="11"&gt;GE&amp;rsquo;s Inspection Technologies&lt;/a&gt; business &amp;mdash; are now being performed as part of their routine checks. By the first quarter of 2011, every one of their bars will have been run through an ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you can see in GoldMoney&amp;rsquo;s demo video below, the ultrasound is designed to spot gaps in the gold, such as air pockets, which might lead to a bar breaking or affect its weight &amp;mdash; as well as look for the presence of other, non-precious, metals that may have been inserted into the bar. And unlike traditional ultrasounds, which can only be &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; by experts, these pictures show flaws that even a layperson can spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Just a few include medical imaging, robotic scanners that travel through oil and gas pipelines, remote monitoring of jet engines, cameras that peer inside of jet and locomotive engines to inspect for wear, and railroad technologies that track speed and manage fleets to maximize efficiency.&lt;/td&gt;

            <title>Plant ensures reliability with predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	LCRA&amp;#39;s utility operations are full of electronic and moving parts. Making sure all those parts stay in working order is the job of predictive maintenance crews. Heat-sensing cameras and vibration detectors are just of couple of the modern tools the crews use to ensure the power and water stay on. Watch as a crew gives an irrigation pumping plant an end-of-season check-up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Arch Coal recognized for excellence in predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal Inc. on September 22 announced that its predictive maintenance program has been named as the best overall program among mobile equipment fleets from around the world by an industrial trade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Earning the best predictive maintenance award is an important achievement for Arch Coal&amp;#39;s national network of mines,&amp;quot; said John W. Eaves, Arch&amp;#39;s president and chief operating officer. &amp;quot;The mining environment is very dynamic, which makes the maintenance of equipment an intense and challenging effort. That&amp;#39;s why our mining personnel value the recognition for their best-in-class practices that include managing risk and reducing exposure through planned, preventative and predictive maintenance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal&amp;#39;s predictive maintenance program employs certified maintenance engineers at each mining complex and standardized processes to provide comprehensive oil and vibration analysis, ultrasonic flaw detection, thermography and motor circuit analysis. This technology is used for quality standards and acceptance testing at component and rebuild facilities certified by Arch. According to Arch&amp;#39;s director of technical and maintenance services, Bob McCreary, Arch has reduced controllable maintenance costs by 5 percent annually over the last four years by integrating a comprehensive predictive maintenance program throughout its national network of mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	St. Louis-based Arch Coal, Inc. is the nation&amp;#39;s second-largest coal producer. The company&amp;#39;s core business is providing U.S. power generators with clean-burning, low-sulfur coal for electric generation. The company also ships coal to domestic and international steel manufacturers as well as international power producers. Through its national network of mines and 4,600-person workforce, Arch supplies the fuel for approximately 8 percent of the electricity generated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/ultrasonic_inspection/~4/Yd59B-fDGTE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>UE launches Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Using knowledge based on three decades of experience, the engineers at UE Systems have developed an entire ultrasonic condition monitoring laboratory &amp;ndash; to fit in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The latest advancement from the manufacturers of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading ultrasonic detection instruments, the Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch provides plant inspection professionals the ability to use iPhone like Touch Screen technology to analyze conditions with a wide range of on-board features including: a spectral analyzer, the ability to take equipment temperature with an infrared thermometer, photograph test points with an on-board camera, select from multiple data screens including dB, temperature, and spectral analysis, pinpoint locations with a laser pointer, store data, sounds, and images, generate reports, review historical record data, plan/review routes, review alarm groups for planning corrective actions, adjust emissivity, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Used for all plant applications, the Touch is something truly special. &amp;ldquo;We are very proud and privileged to introduce such powerful, intuitive technology to plant maintenance professionals&amp;rdquo;, said Alan Bandes, vice president of marketing for UE Systems. &amp;ldquo;Truly a full-featured inspection system, the (Ultraprobe 15,000) Touch takes the most necessary components of ultrasonic inspection and simplifies the process to intuitively guide inspectors through their routes more quickly and effectively.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Used for almost any plant application, the system will truly advance the state of condition-based maintenance, measuring, analyzing and collecting all required data with just one touch. For mechanical and electrical applications, the Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch gives you immediate opportunities to analyze on the spot, using an array of features to report and diagnose premature problems before they occur. The system can also serve as an energy conservation tool to not only find leaks and help determine your carbon footprint emissions and overall energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Download the new SDT ultrasound App for iPhone</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the more perplexing things for new (and old) ultrasound inspectors is what conclusions to draw from their data and trends. The new i-Phone app from SDT North America is designed to make sense of ultrasound trends and baseline increases. For instance, if your baseline is 20dB&amp;micro;V and today&amp;#39;s reading is 26dB&amp;micro;V and you want to know what the 6dB&amp;micro;V increase represents, tap it on your iPhone and you&amp;#39;ll know the increase is a factor of 2X.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SDT North America delivers powerful ultrasound for PdM pros</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The new SDT270 ultrasonic device from SDT North America represents an evolution for predictive maintenance and reliability professionals. Sporting many firsts, the SDT270 is consistent with SDT&amp;rsquo;s mission to design progressive and smart instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first portable ultrasound instrument to include both a built-in temperature sensor and a laser tachometer, the product also has an onboard SQL database to capture and manage survey data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Building Blocks&amp;rsquo; concept adds flexibility&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The SDT270 remains true to SDT&amp;rsquo;s reputation for intelligent instrument design. The company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;building blocks&amp;rdquo; concept combines options for hardware flexibility, software for data management, and sensors that promote ergonomics and ease of use. The SDT270, in combination with the Ultranalysis Suite, maintains simplicity for those who need it, while providing sophistication for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accurate and comparable wave files&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;SDT270 uses True Amplitude to give ultrasound inspectors, for the first time, the ability to maintain a database of accurate sound files. Each wave file is sampled 250,000 time per second. The result is clear, accurate and comparable time signals stored in the SDT270&amp;rsquo;s massive internal memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote support and training&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An ultrasound detector that connects to the Internet offers new levels of support options. Remote access for support, training and measurement triggering brings new possibilities to your ultrasound program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two channel inputs&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Two-channel sequential measurement means multiple sensors can connect to your SDT270 for faster collection of data. Store static data (dB&amp;mu;V), record dynamic sound files, measure temperature and RPM, and acceleration without exchanging sensors. The SDT270 redefines intelligent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	instrument design to make more efficient use of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SDT270&amp;rsquo;s upgradeable platforms&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The SDT270 Platform gives customization with the opportunity to upgrade as your program grows. Choose from six base formats, then add sensors and software to build a collector unique to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SDT270 is even more powerful with UAS software. UAS forms a synergistic partnership between your SDT270, your PC and your PdM team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UAS &amp;ndash; Ultranalysis Suite&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;UAS manages the collection, processing and analysis of data measured by the SDT270. It&amp;rsquo;s a library to store and organize information that&amp;rsquo;s easy to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	UAS manages static data (dB&amp;mu;V, degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, RPM, SCFM, dBA), as well as dynamic data (ultrasound signals for time and spectrum analysis). UAS&amp;rsquo;s tree structure allows for as large a database as you need, with the ability to organize smaller surveys so you can set your own pace. Synchronous databases resident on both your PC and your SDT270 allows on-the-fly creation of survey points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Using PdM technologies to determine, optimize lube condition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The life and reliability of greased machinery depend on proper bearing lubrication. Unfortunately, inadequate grease lubrication is a very common failure mode. With greased bearings, it is difficult to determine lubricant state along with knowing when to grease, how to grease and when to stop greasing. Fortunately, predictive technologies and work processes are being successfully applied to monitor and optimize the lubrication condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improper lubrication creates energy that manifests itself as mechanical stress energy and thermal energy (heat). By analyzing this energy using predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies, much can be learned about the bearing lubrication condition. This article discusses and compares the use of ultrasonic analysis, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration signal processing techniques as means toward determining lubrication state and achieving optimum lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, this article will look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics and progression of lubrication stress,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		an overview and comparision of
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				ultrasonic analysis&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				conventional vibration analysis and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				advanced vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the strengths and weakness of each monitoring method,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the characteristics of various lubricant states obtained in a controlled test environment, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		equipment lubrication case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Traditional greasing programs use time-based preventive maintenance (PM). This method can result in over- or under-greasing, depending on the recommended periodicity of greasing, operating conditions and run time of the machinery. One plant surveyed stated that 90 percent of all motor failures were grease related &amp;ndash; both over- and under-greasing. This particular plant was using motor manufacturer recommendations as the foundation of their greasing program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An alternative greasing program uses PdM processes and technologies. Using PdM, greasing activities are based on the condition of the grease. Several PdM technologies for grease monitoring are available. Vibration tends to be the most common tool used. However, most commonly used vibration techniques do not detect early lubrication faults. Infrared is also an option, although it is not preferred since initial lubrication starvation has little impact on temperature. Some sources maintain grease sampling and analysis is the best method. However, in most circumstances, this is not practical. Many bearings do not have an access port to the grease and those that do present their own problems. The grease samples taken most likely do not represent the true condition of the grease inside the bearing and may also contain particulate and contamination picked up during the sampling. Ultrasonic analysis and advanced vibration signal processing are viable methods of monitoring grease condition since they measure the stress energy caused by friction between the rolling and sliding elements in the bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: The Characteristics and Progression of Lubrication Stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In rolling element bearings, lubrication sound is created by friction-induced stress waves from the interaction of the roller to the race and the roller to the cage. Good roller-to-race interaction is rolling with elastohydrodynamic lubrication. Good roller-to-cage interaction is sliding with hydrodynamic lubrication. Assuming a RMS surface roughness of 0.3 micron, &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; shows that the minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-race is 1 micron, or approximately 1/75 the thickness of a human hair. The minimum lubrication film thickness for the roller-to-cage is 10 microns. As lubrication starvation occurs, the film thickness will decrease, resulting in a greater coefficient of friction. The greater coefficient of friction creates additional energy in the form of heat and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lube sound characteristics for under-lubricated bearings are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		high frequency energy,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		broadband energy, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		primarily random and non-periodic noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency domain of an under-lubricated bearing. Note the high-frequency energy hump in the 20 to 32 kilohertz (KHz) range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; shows the vibration frequency and time domain for a gearbox running with an incorrectly installed oil pump. Note the high frequency in the 10 KHz to 20 KHz range. This energy probably continues to higher frequency range but shows a drop-off due to the accelerometer range and mounting conditions. The time domain shows a raised noise floor with random high spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the lubrication in a bearing degrades, the high-frequency sound characteristics change. A properly lubricated bearing creates random noise with a low noise flow. As the lubricant degrades, the noise floor begins to elevate (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 1&lt;/a&gt;). Listening to a heterodyned 30 KHz signal, the sound is like a waterfall or rushing river. As the lube degrades, spiking begins as the noise floor elevates which sounds like a mild popping sound (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4, Chart 2&lt;/a&gt;). Severe lubrication faults cause more frequent high-amplitude spikes, which sound like bacon sizzling. In Chart 2, as grease was added, the noise floor immediately lowered and the spiking disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do not expect bearing to display the same sound characteristics. The amplitudes, sound patterns and frequencies of the stress energy are influenced by factors such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bearing geometry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Roller design and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Load&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cage design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Type of lubricant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following summarizes key points related to the characteristics of lubrication sound/stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		As lubrication condition degrades, stress energy increases.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication stress energy is broadband, high frequency (about 8 KHz and higher) and random.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Other sources of high-frequency stress energy exist, such as:
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Bearing/gear defects, electrical &amp;ndash; periodic&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Rubs, fluid turbulence &amp;ndash; random&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; To evaluate lube condition, high-frequency diagnostic tools that can measure and differentiate random from periodic noise are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: Overview and Comparison of Ultrasonic Analysis, Conventional Vibration Analysis, and Advanced Vibration Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When monitoring for lubrication faults, sensor selection is critical. Sensors are not the same, so the characteristics of a sensor must be understood. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt; shows the sensor performance of several different diagnostic technologies. The red broad-band sensor would be a poor choice because the high-frequency sounds would be drowned out by the low-frequency noise. The blue narrow-band sensor in the bearing fault area would completely miss any lubricant stress noise. The black broad-band sensor represents a typical accelerometer. It may have a response in the lubrication range, but mounting techniques are critical (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;). The blue narrow-band sensor in the lubrication area has good sensitivity and completely isolates itself from lower-frequency noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt; shows that when using an accelerometer to monitor lubrication stress, either a flat magnet on a clean machined surface or a permanently mounted accelerometer must be used to get the required frequency response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five technologies to identify and monitor lubrication faults are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Infrared thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening using an accelerometer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ultrasonic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conventional vibration analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Vibration analysis with advanced signal processing using PeakVue and Autocorrelation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next few paragraphs will briefly introduce each of these technologies. This will be followed by side-by-side comparison test results for the latter three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is good for detecting possible late-stage lubrication problems. It is not good for catching lubrication problems early. Also, additional technologies will be required to confirm the source of the abnormal temperature signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some vibration analyzers have a headphone output to listen to the accelerometer output (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;). This can be used to listen to the noise within the bearing. A high-pass filter on the sound output is very useful to filter out the low-frequency noise so that the lubrication noise can be heard. This is a quick qualitative method that provides good signal pattern information. It can also indicate a drop in volume, while greasing can indicate that the grease has reached the rollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasonic monitoring provides both listening capability and quantitative measurements (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 8&lt;/a&gt;). The ultrasonic sound is heterodyned into our listening range, and specific sound parameters are measured. The ultrasonic device should isolate the higher frequencies and filter out all lower-frequency noise. If the ultrasonic device uses a narrow-band sensor or resonant sensor, mounting is much easier than with an accelerometer. Generally, just placing the probe on a clean surface provides a good signal. Paint and other obstructions will lower the signal amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conventional vibration analysis analyzes macro vibration &amp;ndash; the motion of a body. It focuses on the lower-frequency events. For an 1,800 rpm motor, a typical maximum frequency would be 60 times running speed, or 1,800 hertz (Hz). &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 9&lt;/a&gt; shows a typical frequency domain plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CSI PeakVue measurement is an advanced signal-processing method. It performs micro vibration analysis, which measures the microscopic movement (stress waves) within a body. It analyzes the energy above the conventional analysis range. PeakVue is not an averaging process, so it captures the true peak amplitude values from the high-frequency information. To create the PeakVue time waveform, the accelerometer signal is routed through a high-pass filter to cut out all low-frequency information. The signal is sampled at more than 100,000 times per second. This digital data stream is broken into data blocks which are a function of the desired Fmax. The only value saved for each data block is the true peak &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; amplitude value. These true peak G levels create the PeakVue time waveform. This PeakVue time waveform is then processed to create a PeakVue frequency domain spectrum (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PeakVue provides a window into the area where lubrication data is located. The nature of lubrication faults make the PeakVue time domain data noisy and difficult to interpret. To assist with this, another advanced signal-processing technique, CSI Autocorrelation, can be applied. Autocorrelation is an averaging process to remove random activity from the time domain. The resultant correlation factor (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11&lt;/a&gt;) is proportional to the amount of periodic energy. If at any point on the correlated waveform the correlation factor is small, then almost all of the energy at that point is random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12&lt;/a&gt; shows a test motor. To compare ultrasonic, conventional vibration analysis and advanced vibration analysis, the top inboard bearing was monitoring both with and without lubricant. The next few paragraphs will compare the results from the three technologies. For the vibration measurements, a mounting pad was glued to a machine flat on the bearing housing. A flat magnet with accelerometer was attached to the pad. A CSI SonicScan was the ultrasonic test device. It measured both lower-frequency energy (4 KHz) and ultrasonic energy (30 KHz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13&lt;/a&gt; compares the time domain data for the three technologies. The conventional vibration data shows almost no difference between lubrication states. PeakVue clearly measures the stress energy caused by the lubrication fault. The SonicScan data was consistent. The lower-frequency energy measurement showed some but little change. The ultrasonic data showed significant change in both the average reading and peak amplitude reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the frequency domains. With conventional vibration, a slight change in periodic activity is noticed. This is likely because the existing bearing mechanical defects are being amplified a little without lubricant. The PeakVue spectrum shows a dramatic increase in stress energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PeakVue time domain for the no-lubricant condition is messy and hard to interpret. When the Autocorrelation is performed (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15&lt;/a&gt;), it is immediately apparent that almost all of the stress energy is random, which is a primary characteristic of lubrication faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Table 1 provides a summary comparison of the discussed technologies. The left side of the table shows technology features that make testing accurate and easy. Accelerometer listening and conventional vibration analysis will not provide good results. Headphones should be used when performing advanced vibration analysis to add a very important qualitative attribute. Advanced vibration analysis provides the best information for determining lubrication condition but requires additional vibration analysis training and special sensor mounting. Ultrasonics provides a good indication of lubrication condition (without access to detailed signature analysis tools) and are easy to use but also require some specialized training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: Characteristics of Various Lubricant States Obtained in a Controlled Test Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To better understand and verify theoretical assumption, a lubrication test stand was built for controlled lubrication testing. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 16&lt;/a&gt; shows the test stand that was used to collect the controlled grease lubrication testing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor drives a control, idler and test bearing. Grease can be introduced into each bearing through its outer race using a zerk fitting on the bearing housing. The idler bearing can be variably loaded to 1,000 pounds. The bearings tested were sealed SKF single-row ball bearings with nine balls. The bearings have an ABEC 1 rating and were driven at 1,780 rpm. For each lubrication condition, peak and average decibel (dB) levels were measured at three frequency ranges. The ranges were 30 kHz (lubrication range), 4 kHz (impact range) and 40 kHz (traditional ultrasonic range). The peak dB level records the highest signal amplitude, such as in a spike, during a data collection period. The average dB level records the average of all the signal peaks during a data collection period and is least affected by spikes. The sound parameters were collected using a Model 7100 SonicScan analyzer using a magnet mount sensor. A magnet mount sensor allowed for hands-free operation and greater repeatability. The temperature was monitored on the bearing housing using a CSI Model 515 spot radiometer with laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, to evaluate the effects on sound of over-lubrication, a new bearing running at steady state under load was slowly greased until grease squeezed through the seals (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 17&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 18&lt;/a&gt; shows no significant increase in sound up to 12 minutes after over-greasing. Over-greasing did create a 7 percent rise in the temperature on the outside of the bearing housing. It should be noted that the rate of grease oxidation and deterioration will increase with increasing temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, to evaluate the effects of under-lubrication, a new bearing with seals removed was brought to steady-state temperature under full load. The bearing was stopped long enough to wipe grease off of one side of the bearing and then retested. The bearing was then washed in solvent to remove all grease (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 19&lt;/a&gt;) and then retested. When the bearing with no grease was approaching total failure, it was progressively regreased and monitored for 30 minutes until it reached steady state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt; shows results from lubricant starvation and then re-lubrication. The dB levels increase with deteriorating lube conditions and they decrease with improving lubrication conditions. The temperature remains constant except when lubricant is absent. While temperature is a good indicator of total lube starvation, it was not a good indicator of partial lube starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seen from &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 20&lt;/a&gt;, the initial re-lubrication made a significant improvement in sound level and temperature even though only one pump, or 0.04 ounces of grease, was introduced. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 21&lt;/a&gt; shows the sound waveform (heterodyned 30 kHz audio output from SonicScan) immediately prior to and after the first pump of grease. A very distinct drop in level occurs when the grease hits the rollers. Additional greasing resulted in a minor sound level decrease and a negligible effect on temperature. Permanent damage likely occurred to the bearing since the sound levels did not return to their original levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in a controlled environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a poor technology for monitoring over-lubrication since over-lubrication does not significantly affect the sound parameters,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature analysis is a good technology for monitoring over-lubrication since it does significantly increase with over-greasing; however, in the field, be aware of process and environmental effects on the temperature,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sound analysis is a good technology for monitoring normal and under-lubricated bearings since the sound levels increase with deteriorating conditions and decrease with improving conditions,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lubrication problems that are not corrected in early stages will result in permanent mechanical damage, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Listening during greasing for a decrease in the sound level is a good indicator of grease entering the bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: Equipment Lubrication Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication ultrasonic analysis was performed on the following operating industrial equipment: food processing conveyor bearings, 75-horsepower General Electric motors, and 450 HP Baldor motor. The conveyor testing occurred during a single day, while the motor testing occurred over a seven-month period. The testing confirmed and validated the characteristics of lubrication sound and the findings from the controlled environment testing. The instrument used to analyze the sound was a CSI Model 7100 SonicScan with a multi-frequency contact probe (see &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 22&lt;/a&gt;) instead of a magnet mount sensor. Measurements were taken on the top of the zerk fitting. In general, contact probe measurements are not as repeatable as magnet mount sensor because of variable contact angles and pressures. The advantage of the contact probe is that it can easily fit into tight places and can be used on zerk fittings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Processing Conveyor Bearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The survey included 13 bearings from a conveyor in a food processing plant. Most of the bearings were pressure-washed frequently with water and greased daily. Bearing No. 11 was elevated above floor level, in a difficult-to-reach position, and apparently not greased regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each bearing was tested three times before greasing and three times after greasing. Of all the bearings that were greased daily, the additional greasing had little or no effect on the bearing sound. Greasing significantly affected bearing No. 11. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 23&lt;/a&gt; shows a summary of the readings taken at both the 4 kHz and 30 kHz frequency ranges. It also shows the peak (PH) and average (AV) readings at each frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For each set of columns, the first column shows the mean dB reading of all 13 bearings. The second column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 before greasing. The third column shows the dB reading of bearing No. 11 after greasing. In both the 4 kHz peak and 4 kHz average readings, bearing No. 11 was slighter higher than mean before greasing and slightly lower than mean after greasing. The 30 kHz peak reading shows a significantly elevated dB before greasing and a significant dB drop after greasing. The greatest change occurred with the 30 kHz average reading with the average reading dropping from the upper 20s to almost zero. In this test, the 30 kHz average reading was the most sensitive parameter for measuring lubrication condition. It should also be noted that permanent mechanical damage was unlikely since the 4 kHz peak (mechanical impact) reading dropped to below mean and the 30 kHz average (lubrication) reading dropped to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headphones were used with the SonicScan to provide additional qualitative information. Unfortunately, in this environment, a lot of noise existed in all of the measurements. Metal cans were clattering on the conveyor, belts were sliding and the background was loud. For these or other reasons, the headphones did not provide useful information in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;75 HP General Electric Motors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 75 HP General Electric motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive blowers. Each bearing has a single shield toward the rotor. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 12 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 24&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. Notice that the inboard bearing dB level dropped to almost zero after greasing and remained constant through 766 hours. The outboard bearing performed similarly except that the dB level began to increase after 358 hours. This could be caused by a lot of factors, such as possibly only a small amount of the grease that entered the cavity actually made to it the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 25&lt;/a&gt; shows a similar plot for a second 75 HP General Electric motor. The 30 kHz sound level performed as expected. The 4 kHz dB level seemed to not be affected by greasing. The 4 kHz dB levels very likely can be affected by noise from other machinery and processes since sonic sound travels through material much better and attenuates much slower than ultrasonic signals. The 40 kHz signal did not perform as expected. In general, the 40 kHz signal is less reliable since the amount of lubrication energy created at 40 kHz is less than what is created at 30 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;450 HP Baldor Motor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several 450 HP Baldor Super E motors were monitored. The motors run at 1,780 rpm and drive large blowers. Each bearing is neither shielded nor sealed. The grease cavity has a zerk fitting at 12 o&amp;rsquo;clock and an unused grease vent plug at 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock. Access to the grease vents is restricted because of the design of the motor mount. The motors are greased every 3,500 hours with 24 grease gun pumps. Currently, the maintenance group has no idea of the lubricant condition before or after greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 26&lt;/a&gt; plots the lubrication sound levels according to the number of hours on the motor since greasing. At 3,411 hours, the bearing was greased &amp;ndash; first four pumps and then an additional four pumps. With the 30 kHz readings, the sound levels dropped significantly, while they increased slightly with additional grease. Because of this increase, greasing was stopped. Only after 552 hours, the sound level returned to its previous level, that is most likely a state of adequate lubrication. Like with the GE motors, the 4 kHz sound was not affected by the greasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 27&lt;/a&gt; charts another Baldor motor bearing. At 30 kHz, this bearing has a steady sound level until 3,278 hours. After greasing, the sound level dropped back close to the previous level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the sound monitoring in an industrial environment as they apply to lubrication monitoring can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In all of the GE and Baldor bearings, the 30 kHz average reading provided the most predictable readings. The 40 kHz readings generally followed the 30 kHz readings but were less consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greasing did not affect the 4 kHz readings. The 4 kHz reading can be very useful in analyzing the bearing&amp;rsquo;s mechanical condition or as a confirmation technique for conventional vibration analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Trying to determine lubrication condition by listening alone is ineffective since the lubrication sound is primarily white noise. Quantifiable and repeatable analysis is required to accurately assess lubrication condition. The qualitative information from listening is very useful for general listening and checking for other problems. It can also be useful during lubrication to determine when grease enters the bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		For all of the industrial bearings tested, optimum or baseline lubrication levels (30 kHz frequency and average sound parameter) were around 10 dB or lower. The normal operating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lubrication levels were around 10 to 20 dB. For the test stands bearing and conveyor bearing, the critical level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;before permanent damage occurred was around 30 dB. This would imply that the greasing level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;should occur between 20 and 30 dB. These estimates are very general. More exact levels should be determined by type of bearing and application. This could be accomplished through testing and long-term trending.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All the bearing testing did not exhibit a standard lubrication cycle except that increasing hours eventually resulted in increasing sound levels and that re-lubrication resulted in decreasing sound levels except for the case of already over-lubricated bearings. Specific lubrication cycles for specific bearings could be understood through long-term trending. This would provide much information on the real-time lubrication condition and projected performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By trending the sound levels along with the lubrication intervals and grease amounts, the grease interval and volume can be optimized. The most favorable temperatures will be obtained when the bearing is supplied with the minimum quantity of lubricant to provide proper lubrication. Therefore, as a general rule, less grease is better than more grease. The trending will reveal the cause and effect of lubrication quantity on lubrication condition and interval. Lubrication monitoring with vibration was performed on a pump, scrubber fan and exhaust blower.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 28&lt;/a&gt; shows the conventional vibration data for a pump. This data shows no indication of a lubrication fault. The PeakVue data for the same pump shows high G levels and random patterns which could indicate a lubrication fault (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 29&lt;/a&gt;). The autocorrelation of the PeakVue waveform confirms that the energy is almost all random (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 30&lt;/a&gt;). The pump locked up one month later due to lack of lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next vibration case history is for a scrubber fan. The PeakVue data on April 19 (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 31&lt;/a&gt;) was below the alert level. On May 29, the PeakVue data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 32&lt;/a&gt;) was in alarm with a 500 percent increase in G amplitude. The autocorrelation of the May 29 data (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 33&lt;/a&gt;) revealed no periodicity. This random high-frequency energy is a strong indicator of a lubrication fault. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 34&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the PeakVue time waveforms. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 35&lt;/a&gt; shows a comparison of the conventional time waveform data. Note that no increase occurred with the conventional data (Fmax of 3 KHz). The source of the lubrication fault was a faulty oiler bowl. As soon as the oiler bowl was fixed, the PeakVue data returned to normal levels (&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 36&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third vibration equipment case study is for an exhaust blower. A new type of grease with limestone and graphite additives was used. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 37&lt;/a&gt; shows the frequency domain before and after the new grease was added. The new grease caused significant high-frequency energy &amp;ndash; 8 KHz and higher. &lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/IMAGES_and_CHARTS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 38&lt;/a&gt; shows the PeakVue time domain comparison. Notice the large increase in friction energy because of the different lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These three equipment case studies show that advanced vibration analysis using PeakVue and autocorrelation are effective techniques to identify and monitor lubrication condition. They also show that conventional vibration analysis is not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To achieve optimum lubrication, it is important to be able to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the lubrication condition at any time;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the conditions when re-lubrication is necessary;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the volume of grease required for re-greasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As seen from this article, multiple predictive technologies can provide immediate information about the lubrication condition while the equipment is operating. Each of these technologies has strengths and limitations. For effective lubrication monitoring, each of the technology&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses must be understood along with the physical characteristics of lubrication energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication analysis using advanced vibration analysis should be performed on all critical machines, especially if the equipment is already being monitored for bearing defects. If equipment is critical enough to warrant vibration analysis, then the lubrication can be monitored as a part of that process. Many companies do not monitor lubrication because of the cost to prepare a proper mounting surface for the accelerometer. This cost is insignificant when compared to the cost of a lubrication fault in terms of lost production, lost equipment life and higher maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When lubrication analysis is combined with good trending and monitoring, greasing intervals and amounts can be optimized. All of this results in knowing the equipment better and being better able to maintain it, extend its life, and predict its performance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On a day last month, in the early morning hours, I embarked on the scheduled task of inspecting the miles of power lines that are strung throughout the chemical plant in Central Florida where I work as a reliability analyst. The task was simple. I was to perform an infrared and ultrasound inspection on the high-voltage power line connections, disconnects, fuses and transformers, as well as the electrical equipment and components, located in nine substations throughout the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I started on the southeast side of the plant and worked my way northwest toward the two steam turbine generators that were supplying several plants as well as the public power grid with an approximate combined load of 59 megawatts (MW) at 69 kilovolts (KV) that morning. I found several small problems working my way around, including a few high-voltage components with corona activity present that I observed and recorded with the ultrasound equipment as well as a faulty connection at a fuse clip on a high-voltage line supplying power to a processing plant that I observed and captured with an infrared camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then I saw something strange with my own eyes. Just two power poles away from the first turbine was a bright red line above my head. At approximately 5:30 a.m., I found myself in the dark, spinning in a circle, looking up, down and all around, visually trying to figure out where the reflection was coming from. Then it hit me! It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reflection. I could visually see the 69 KV power line glowing bright red in the dark.&amp;nbsp;Stepping back away from the pole, I viewed it on the IR camera from what I felt was a relatively safe distance and angle, just in case the line decided to break and fall in my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;PdM analyst uncovers issues on 69 KV power line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the center phase jumper, I observed a pretty apparent inaccurate temperature of approximately 312 degrees Fahrenheit. That reading was due to being out of my measurable field of view with a Delta T of 228&amp;deg;F and another anomaly that was not seen visually with an inaccurate temperature of approximately 137&amp;deg;F with a Delta T of 57&amp;deg;F on the lower phase. Undeterred by the inaccurate measurements, I still saved the image. At the time, I believed that the temperature of the center phase jumper must have been at least 800&amp;deg;F in order for it to produce the bright red glow that was visually present. I also snapped a visual picture in an attempt to capture an image of the line glowing in the dark. I immediately informed the production manager in charge of the turbines and escorted him to the pole so he could see for himself that it was glowing. After his visual conformation, he informed his superiors immediately of the situation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few hours of discovering the fault, plant reliability engineers, maintenance planners and the plant electrical superintendent had a plan in place to perform an unscheduled power outage and repair the connections immediately in an effort to avoid the additional cost that would be incurred if the plants were to shut down abruptly without any notice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The power line that was isolated was leaving one of the steam-driven turbines carrying a load of approximately 34 MW at 69 KV when the fault was discovered. It supplied power to the local power company&amp;rsquo;s grid as well as six different processing plants, administrative offices and one maintenance shop. All of them were shut down unscheduled but were given enough notice to reduce any additional cost of corrective measures that would have needed to take place had the plants gone down without the proper procedures and protocols being followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon shutdown, the high-voltage electricians discovered the connections on the jumper that had been glowing were so damaged that the entire line length had to be replaced from one pole to the other. The initial investigation indicated an improper compression connecter was used to splice the jumper to the line going to the next pole. The connector was sized for the gauge of wire used between the two poles; however, the jumper was of a smaller gauge, thus making a weak connection. This was headed for catastrophic failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The faults were reassessed the following morning after the proper corrective measures were taken. The Delta T on both faults was reduced to within 5&amp;deg;F under approximately the same load, ambient and surrounding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/ultrasonic_inspection/~4/2TPfbChmIpk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title> What do you mean compressed air isn't free?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It is amazing that while there is so much discussion in various media about energy and carbon reduction, most plant personnel fail to realize that there are incredible opportunities for cutting energy waste and carbon gases right under their proverbial noses. These are opportunities that could dramatically improve their company&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, many management personnel fail to realize that it isn&amp;rsquo;t always necessary to commit to major capital-intensive programs that produce long-term returns on investment. They often are either not aware of or just overlook inexpensive projects with short-term, almost immediate returns that will improve energy efficiencies in their plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One answer is looking for and repairing leaks in utilities such as compressed air and steam. These programs often provide a very fast and dramatic return on investment. In some cases, this has translated to hundreds of thousands and as high as millions of dollars per year without major capital investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compressed air is one utility that offers tremendous savings potential. The problem is that there are many plant personnel who don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand that compressed air isn&amp;rsquo;t free. There is the attitude that since it&amp;rsquo;s just air and it&amp;rsquo;s used every day, it&amp;rsquo;s free and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require much attention, even if there are obvious leaks. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. Compressed air is an extremely expensive utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, back in 1995, the U.S. Department of Energy instituted a Compressed Air Challenge to help industry reduce the use of compressed air by 10 percent by 2010. They had stated that compressed air is one of the most costly utilities in plants and, of all the compressed air produced in the USA, 30 percent was lost to leaks. They estimated the annual cost to be approximately $3.2 billion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why is compressed air so costly? It is extremely expensive to produce and it is very inefficient to use. Of the energy required to produce compressed air, less than 20 percent of input energy is left for use. That means 80 percent of what is paid for is used up before compressed air is put in the distribution system. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how inefficient compressed air is. If we compare the cost of running a one-horsepower electric motor to a one-horsepower compressed air motor, the former might cost $200 per year while the latter $1,500 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One simple approach for those facilities that use compressed air is to schedule routine compressed air audits and leak surveys. Compressed air leak surveys often disclose the cost of wasted air impacting the electric bill ranging form tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of annualized dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chart below is an example of how costly compressed air leaks can be. While the numbers relate to one leak, imagine the cost of hundreds of leaks with sizes ranging from 1/16 of an inch up to 3/4 of an inch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/waetjen001.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While design and compressor efficiency are important factors to consider regarding system efficiencies, there are two other contributing factors to excessive energy consumption in a compressed air system: leaks and misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the plant level, there are many workers who are under the assumption that &amp;ldquo;air is free&amp;rdquo;, and for this reason air is often misused and wasted. Air leaks are ignored. It is not uncommon to walk through a plant where the telltale loud hissing sounds associated with gross leaks are heard and taken for granted as background noise. If leaks are too loud to be tolerated, we have seen rags or duct tape wrapped around them to reduce the sound level and make it more acoustically comfortable for the personnel in the area. Abuses also have been observed. At times, personnel have placed air hoses in a position to continually cool their working space. In one instance, an enclosed metal box was set up in a plant with an air hose run through the top, positioned to continually blow air on soda pop cans to keep them cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Engineers also have misunderstood the inefficiency and cost associated with compressed air. Some common wasteful and costly practices in many plants are using compressed air to blow on and cool bearings or to continuously blow on conveyors to clean them. We have seen drain valves left open with big warnings placed on the tanks above stating: &amp;ldquo;Do not close this valve, keep it open.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/waetjen002.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One simple, inexpensive approach to reducing compressed air waste in facilities is to embark on an educational campaign. Meetings are often a good start, where the cost of energy waste and its impact on operating costs in particular can be discussed. Personnel can be asked to help identify misuse and be encouraged to inform their co-workers. Motivational signs can be placed around the plant to illustrate wasteful behavior and suggest changes. Newsletters can be used to promote a campaign. A suggestion box can be set up and rewards or awards given to the most effective suggestion. In some cases, monetary rewards based on the value of the suggestion have been given to personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the misuse or misapplication of compressed air, a survey can be undertaken to look at alternatives to compressed air. For example, instead of blowing compressed air on a bearing, try a fan. Instead of mixing or agitating with air, try an electric mixer. Keeping in front of the issue and looking around for alternative resources can help reduce the electric bill noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since about 30 percent of all the compressed air produced is lost to leaks, it is imperative for a facility to incorporate a compressed air leak survey program. Not only is this a &amp;ldquo;non-capital intensive&amp;rdquo;, relatively inexpensive approach, the results can be gained as quickly as the leaks are repaired. Energy consumption, specifically the reduction of electricity usage, also will have an impact on a plant&amp;rsquo;s carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compressed air leak detection surveys require planning, personnel, training, equipment, identification, reporting and follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without planning, the program can be lost and ineffective. Planning includes consultation with plant management and plant personnel, observation and review of the compressed air system. A &amp;ldquo;walk-through&amp;rdquo; for any survey is recommended. This is performed to help set up the survey, breaking it down to small, workable units. Safety issues can be observed, route logistics can be planned, which can include where to begin and where to end in a particular section. A walk-through also can help plan what equipment will be needed. Are there keys needed to open cabinets, flashlights for dimly lit areas, ladders or lifts or special modules for piping in ceilings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Personnel should understand the goals of the program and should understand how to conduct a leak survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training provides personnel with the knowledge and methods needed to effectively perform a survey. Properly trained inspectors learn how to plan for and conduct a compressed air leak survey using inspection techniques that avoid problems such as misidentification or improper labeling, which might lead to costly mistakes and unreliable results. They also learn how to use reporting tools to calculate and demonstrate survey savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using the right equipment for the job will add to the effectiveness of the survey. The most common tool for compressed air leak surveys is an ultrasonic detector. These instruments sense high-frequency components of turbulence produced by air leaks. Directional in nature, ultrasound is a localized signal which makes it relatively easy to locate the source of the leak. If the instrument is not sensitive enough, some mid-sized leaks might be missed. If there are accessibility issues such as leaks in ceilings or in layers of pipes or behind walls or underground, consider special modules that adapt to these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Identification of leaks is very important. The leak should be tagged and (if possible) photographed to assist those who are responsible for the repair to locate the leak and perform the fix. A big, brightly colored tag can help. If possible, use a tagging system to correlate with location, component, pressure, CFM or even the cost of the leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any survey needs reporting. A report can be a form of &amp;ldquo;leak management&amp;rdquo;. A leak report should be useful on many levels. The report helps identify the specific leak, the number of leaks, an identifying number which can correlate to a work order and the location of the leaks. Some reports also will include a summary of identified and &amp;ldquo;actualized&amp;rdquo; cost avoidance along with identified and &amp;ldquo;actualized&amp;rdquo; carbon footprint reduction. The actualized is the leaks that have been repaired, which represents the real savings of a survey. Unfortunately, there have been instances where good intentions resulted in costly mistakes simply because surveys were performed with no allowance for planning of leak repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some software allows for the summation of surveys over time to demonstrate the cumulative annualized cost savings. Other reporting features can include demonstration of reduction of the carbon footprint gases that are associated with the energy cost of leaks. Below are examples of this type of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/waetjen003.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Note the columns stating &amp;ldquo;Identified leaks Cost Avoidance&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Repaired Leaks Cost Avoidance&amp;rdquo;. It is only when a leak is &lt;em&gt;repaired&lt;/em&gt; that the savings are realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/waetjen004.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is necessary that all parties responsible for the leak survey be on the same page. Communication is essential. Maintenance managers and planners must understand the necessity of leak repair and a workable schedule set. For example, if 200 leaks are found in a survey and the report is left with those responsible for the repairs without an explanation, there is the possibility that these leaks might be looked on as an additional 200 work orders and left unattended. If discussions of repair included the participation of the repair team, a method could be established to break the repairs down into small, workable chunks starting with the most costly leaks first or pairing leaks that are close together, making leak repair more efficient. Inclusion and communication will lead to cost savings and a successful program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow-up of listed repairs will help assure leaks have, in fact, been repaired and no new leaks developed due to the repair. It will also include a review of system pressures to be restored to original settings. Finally, the review of the entire survey will help set up the logistics for all subsequent surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Energy savings can be realized without major capital expenditures. Compressed air is a costly utility that is often taken for granted. It is not free. In fact, it is one of the most costly utilities in plants today. A comprehensive program of leak repair that includes education of plant personnel, planning, training, methods of identifying and repairing leaks, and a system of reporting survey results can lead to reduction of energy use, increased profitability and an improved carbon footprint. A compressed air leak survey is a truly &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; way to improve profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to manage a multi-technology condition monitoring program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Managing a multi-technology condition monitoring program at a large mining operation was a challenging task, especially when there has been a cultural shift required to integrate the ideas of condition monitoring into an already complex maintenance strategy. One of the major challenges included shifting the focus of an experienced maintenance crew from a run-to-failure mentality to a proactive mentality. Another major challenge was folding the new work practices into the current work flow model, one which didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of emphasis on backlogged maintenance items. Finally, coaching the supervision and management about why this is the right move proved to be one of the more difficult tasks of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But now less than a year later, dramatic results are being realized. As the condition monitoring statistics trend in the right direction, maintenance costs are shifting sharply as well. Overtime has dropped, and unplanned downtime has decreased significantly. The best part is the workforce is becoming more and more focused on fixing problems rather than fixing machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This paper will share some of the stories and many of the measures that made this shift possible. In addition, some of the software tools and work flow models that helped drive the measures and decision making processes will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine is a large, open-pit mining operation located 25 miles south of Lakeland, Fla. Four Corners is one of six mines belonging to The Mosaic Corporation, the world&amp;rsquo;s 13th-largest producer of phosphate fertilizer. The Four Corners Mine produces approximately 6.5 million tons of phosphate rock annually. The mine has three distinct areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dragline Operations: Electric draglines are used for mineral extraction. There are six draglines averaging 50 cubic yards each.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field Pumping System: 82 large 2,000-horsepower pumps are used to move the unprocessed phosphate rock (matrix) from the draglines to the float plant. This makes for nearly 70 miles of 20-inch and 22-inch pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Float Plant: The float plant includes numerous conveyors, vibrating screens, pumps and log washers that are all used to clean the phosphate rock and separate the debris and unwanted material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told there are 775 pieces of rotating equipment on the entire facility. There are 270 employees at the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four Corners Mine, with 110 of them in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine embarked on the implementation of a multi-technology condition monitoring program in March 2005 and has seen some very dramatic changes take place since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand the Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were and still remain several large challenges to getting the process completely ironed out. Like any process that involves more than one person, the relationships between the people play a vital role in continued success. Each of the individuals has to develop a level of trust in the others and as a group they have to develop a unified sense of purpose. Finding and retaining qualified personnel is another large challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring personnel who want to work in a mining environment and have any experience at all are very difficult to come by. As everyone begins to work together on a daily basis attitudes and personalities start to play major roles in the group&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping all these technical people working and working together can prove to be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key challenges is developing an understanding of the process between the maintenance group and condition monitoring group. The maintenance people have to understand the condition monitoring process, and the condition monitoring people have to understand the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without each fully grasping the other&amp;rsquo;s process and where they themselves fit into the other process, any kind of forward momentum will be difficult to initiate. Finally, internal group politics can play a large role in extinguishing improvements in the overall process. If there are individuals who tend to not give credit where credit is due, hard feelings can develop. On the other hand, if the leaders of the change process are quick to hand out pats on the back and do it often, then everyone feels they are appreciated and tend to work even harder to advance the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desire to Succeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key role in the success of any process is a strong desire to succeed. That desire is easily seen at the Four Corners Mine. The maintenance manager is the catalyst that keeps the program rolling on a daily basis. The manager&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward condition monitoring as a part of the overall maintenance strategy is what keeps the rest of the maintenance department focused. Above the maintenance manager, in the corporate office, the desire for the program to succeed is seen as well. The benefits of the condition monitoring program have been folded into the overall financial strategy of the mining operations at the Mosaic operations of central Florida. The condition monitoring program is expected to produce results in the safety, costs and availability areas of the overall plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety measures have been affected by means of reduced overtime and call-out work. When crafts personnel are not called out as much at night to work on equipment that has failed during a scheduled production shift, the likelihood for injury has been reduced. When the precise nature of a problem has been identified prior to work commencing and the craftsmen don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend unnecessary time and effort looking for the problem, the likelihood for injury has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Being able to identify problems and get them corrected long before additional damage happens to other components of a machine reduces the overall cost of the repair. All of these add up to reduced unplanned downtime which is increased machinery availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multi-technology Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Four Corners Mine decided early to employ as many condition monitoring technologies as they could to provide the highest likelihood of identifying the actual failure modes of the assets. Vibration analysis, contact ultrasonic emissions, oil analysis and mechanical infrared thermography were chosen to identify rotating machinery defects. Motor circuit analysis and electrical infrared thermography were chosen to identify the failure modes of the electric motors and the associated switchgear. See Figure 1 for the percentage of coverage by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Technology Available&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mosaic Company also decided early on that an investment in the best technology available would help ensure the best results. CSI 2130s were chosen as the vibration analysis platform. Mikron infrared cameras were chosen for the thermography effort. The UE Systems 10,000 was selected for contact and airborne ultrasonic analysis. And, the venerable PdMA MCE/Emax was selected as the motor circuit analyzer of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="342" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon02.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Integrated Condition Status Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web-based Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Web-based reporting platform is used to communicate the results of all condition monitoring technologies to Mosaic personnel. A Web-based reporting tool was selected for numerous reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It requires no software to be installed on customer&amp;rsquo;s computers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It can be accessed from any computer with access to the World Wide Web.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is not limited to any particular hardware or software platform for the different technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is easily expandable as other technologies are added or removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mosaic wants all levels of supervision to be involved in the identification and elimination of machinery faults. Consequently everyone has access to the software. Figure 2 shows an example of a report available in the software that summarizes all of the problems identified in a given area of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated Work Flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A fully integrated work flow model would be defined as one where both the Mosaic personnel and the Allied Reliability personnel had equal ownership in getting the work identified and accomplished. Figure 3 shows the work flow model, which is color-coded to quickly identify who is responsible for which part of the process. It was decided that this integrated workflow would provide the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get Mosaic and Allied interacting on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure Mosaic personnel took ownership of certain portions of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technician can make clear recommendations not just alert the customer to the technical aspects of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interaction at the lowest level creates a learning process for both the technician and the craftsmen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The &amp;ldquo;Post Check&amp;rdquo; is the feedback loop for the maintenance repair process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Relationship between the technician, supervisor and mechanic &amp;hellip; crucial for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="307" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon03.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Four Corners &amp;ndash; Condition Monitoring Work Flow Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was agreed that workforce education was an important foundational element that would keep the process going. Four Corners continues to make a significant effort to educate all maintenance employees about P-F intervals (see Figure 4). In addition, technology familiarization was also a major topic. Making all of the front-line supervisors and craftsmen aware of the different condition monitoring technologies and how they worked was seen as a key component of gaining acceptance. The reliability engineers conduct monthly &amp;ldquo;lunch and learn&amp;rdquo; sessions where sandwiches are brought in and key program elements and/or technology demonstrations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="256" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon04.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. P-F Interval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated Focus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a dedicated focus, it is very easy to lose sight of the goal. To ensure this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen, Four Corners dedicated a good portion of the reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s time to overseeing the process. Their goal is to maintain maintenance engagement and awareness while at the same time measuring and benchmarking the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s results and success as well as Allied Reliability&amp;rsquo;s. Successes are purposely celebrated at weekly meetings and misses are clearly identified and root causes eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Salmon05.gif" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. MTBF &amp;ndash; Motor Failures (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The entire process must be inundated with an attitude of constant improvement, and at Four Corners, it is. The maintenance manager is always pushing for more and better results. The reliability engineers are always pushing for more detailed explanations of problems and more focus on eliminating root causes. In an effort to help maintain this focus, Allied Reliability provides Four Corners with a monthly report on numerous measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Red, Yellow and Green Condition Entries, both overall and by technology&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percent of Condition Entries Implemented&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Work Orders Generated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Route Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average Time to Implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-world Measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows are three graphs representing the effect that Four Corners&amp;rsquo; attitude toward constant improvement and condition monitoring has had since March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How ultrasound can prevent electrical failures</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Arc flash can kill. Arc flash can be considered as a short circuit through the air. It produces tremendous stored-up energy that will travel outward from electrical equipment. An arc flash produces temperatures as high as 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hotter than the sun and produces a force that is equivalent to being hit by a hand grenade. The impact is so high it can cause hearing loss and memory loss. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill you, it will severely burn or injure you. In addition, the conditions that produce an arc flash, even when no arc flash occurs, will also lead to damage to electrical equipment causing unplanned outages and costly downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Statistics show that five to 10 arc flash explosions occur in electric equipment daily within the United States*. Unreported instances are reputed to be several times greater. Many of these victims are so badly burned they require treatment at special burn centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has become aggressive in their attempts to reduce arc flash incidents and has begun to use the National Fire Protection Association NFPA 70E Standard for Electrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces, 2005 edition**, as the guide for compliance for worker safety. There are standards for arc flash assessment, various types of personal protective equipment (PPE), working around energized equipment and opening enclosed equipment, to name a few. All are geared for worker safety. There are many causes of arc flash. It can occur in any electrical equipment regardless of voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arc flash incidents can happen from poor work habits, dropping of tools or accidental contact with energized equipment. However, there are conditions that produce the potential for arc flash within enclosed cabinets that can be detected before creating flashover or arc flash incidents. These conditions are arcing, tracking and corona. While infrared thermography will detect heat generated by arcing and in most instances tracking, it will not sense corona. If cabinets are enclosed, unless there is an IR test port, it is highly unlikely that infrared will detect the presence of these emissions. In addition, to view components within enclosed electrical cabinets, it is necessary to conform to NFPA standards with regard to PPE; therefore, in many situations, IR inspectors must wear cumbersome clothing and hoods and perform the required procedure to open cabinets for inspection. This can be very time consuming and, in hot weather, very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An integrated approach incorporating infrared and ultrasound is recommended for the detection of the potential of arc flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arcing, tracking and corona emissions produce ionization. Ionization, a process by which a neutral atom or molecule loses or gains electrons, thereby acquiring a net charge and becoming an ion, occurs as the result of the dissociation of the atoms of a molecule in solution or of a gas in an electric field***. Ionization has by-products: ozone and nitrogen oxides. These combine with moisture to produce nitric acid, which is destructive to most dialectics and certain metallic compositions, resulting in corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The object of electric condition monitoring is to detect the presence of these events before flashover occurs or before they produce an arc flash incident when a cabinet is opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Airborne/structure borne ultrasound technology is ideally suited for detecting these emissions since the ionization process produces ultrasound. Ultrasonic instruments sense between 20 and 100 kilohertz (kHz) and use heterodyning to translate the ultrasonic emissions into the audible range. These portable instruments provide information via headphones for the audio signal and on a meter to display intensity readings, usually as decibels. These hand-held devices usually contain two sensing heads containing piezoelectric transducers: a scanning module for airborne sounds and a contact probe/wave-guide for structure borne signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How portable instruments detect potential failure and arc flash conditions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, an operator will scan around the door seams and air vents of enclosed electrical cabinets with the scanning module while listening through headphones and observing a display panel. Arcing, tracking and corona all have distinct sound qualities that can be heard. If there are no air paths, the inspector will use the wave-guide to probe around the cabinet wall. Due to a possible change in wave characteristics as the ultrasound moves from airborne to structure borne, the operator will change the frequency from 40 kHz (effective for airborne scans) to 25 kHz. Should there be a need to analyze these patterns further, the sounds can be recorded and played back on spectral analysis software. Voltage will play a role in the diagnosis since corona will only occur at 1,000 volts and higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The advantage of spectral analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There may be instances where it is difficult to determine the type of problem heard through the headphones. In these situations, a sound recording of the condition can be made (some instruments have onboard sound recording capability) and viewed on spectral analysis software. The sounds may be heard in real time as they are viewed on an FFT or time series screen for analysis. This enables inspectors to observe subtle problems that might be missed by just viewing a screen without sound. As an example, the following screen shows a transformer that had a typical transformer hum. By just observing the screen, the condition of loose windings might have been overlooked. The sound sample, showing a buildup and drop off of the sound along with movement on the screen, highlighted this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="331" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/goodman01.jpg" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="329" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/goodman02.jpg" width="439" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If any of these conditions are detected, the potential for arc flash exists and operators will be prepared to follow the correct procedures to safely open and repair the condition. Infrared scans can be taken to confirm the diagnosis and to identify any additional problems that would generate heat and not sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We are often asked at which voltages and on what type of equipment is ultrasound most effective. The answer is not simple since it often depends on the individual asking the question. First of all, determining the definition of low, mid and high voltages is relative. Those in the power distribution arena will look at 12 kilovolts (kV) as low voltage, those who work in a typical manufacturing plant will look on 440 volts as high voltage. The main electric problems detected ultrasonically are partial discharge, arcing, tracking and corona. Ultrasound detects the ionization of air, as it produces turbulence. This can be from corona, tracking or arcing. Heat is produced when there is either resistance due to corrosion or from tracking and arcing. Since heat is produced by the flow of current through corrosion or resistance, you can have a &amp;ldquo;hot spot&amp;rdquo; detectable with IR, and have no ultrasound because there would be no ionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Low voltages: &lt;/strong&gt;The main concern in low-voltage equipment is arcing. Typically, 110-, 220- and 440-volt systems are inspected with infrared imaging and/or spot radiometers for temperature changes. Hot spots, usually an indication of resistance, can be indicative of a potential for equipment failure or it could indicate a possible fire hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When arcing occurs, it is often accompanied by heat. However, it is not always possible to detect a hot spot if the equipment is covered. Ultrasound will hear arcing in circuit breakers, switches, contacts and relays. In most instances, a quick scan of a door seal or vent will detect the ultrasound emission. Listening for internal arcing in circuit breakers and switches can be accomplished with the contact probe. For example, touch a circuit breaker switch with the contact probe to listen for internally generated arcing. The most effective method of low-voltage inspection will be to combine infrared imaging with an ultrasonic probe. Please keep in mind that since air cannot be a conductor of electricity below 1,000 volts, corona cannot exist. Any &amp;ldquo;buzzing&amp;rdquo; sounds are either loose components vibrating at 60 (or 50) Hz or tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Mid and high voltage: &lt;/strong&gt;Higher voltages often produce more potential for equipment outage. Problems such as arcing, destructive corona or tracking (sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;baby arcing&amp;rdquo;) and corona as well as partial discharges and mechanical looseness all produce detectable ultrasound that warn of impending failure. Detecting these emissions is relatively easy with ultrasound. The acoustic difference among these potentially destructive events is the sound pattern. Arcing produces erratic bursts, with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	sudden starts and stops of energy, while corona is a steady &amp;ldquo;buzzing&amp;rdquo; sound. Destructive corona has a build-up and drop-off of energy, resulting in a buzzing sound accompanied by subtle popping noises. While scanning for these emissions, use a parabolic reflector. These accessories can more than double the detection distance of the standard scanning modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partial discharge (PD) which occurs inside electrical components such as in transformers and insulated buss bars, is another problem that can be detected with ultrasound. Partial discharge can be quite destructive. It is affected by and causes deterioration of insulation. This is heard as a combination of buzzing and popping noises. The contact probe is employed for PD detection. If your instrument has frequency tuning, try 20 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis of recorded signals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it is relatively easy to determine arcing, tracking or corona by the sound pattern, there can be occasions where it may prove confusing. It may be possible that a strong buzzing sound related to corona might in fact be nothing more than mechanical looseness. Spectral analysis and time domain can be useful tools in analyzing electric emissions. Since all Ultraprobe instruments heterodyne ultrasound down into the audible range, either the headphone jack or the instrument itself (Ultraprobe 10000) may be used to record sounds. You must use a suitable recording device that has a suitable bandwidth in the lower frequencies. Digital voice recorders are not acceptable as they only can record signals above 300 hertz (Hz), which is not low enough to be useful for the 50 or 60 Hz peaks. Laptop computers, MP3 recorders or a quality cassette recorders work well for recording the signals in the field. When recording the signals, you need to make certain that the signal is not distorted. On the analog instruments, you should not let the signal go over 50 percent of full scale on the signal strength indicator. On the digital instruments, you should try to maintain the signal strength to between two to four segments of the bar graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These sounds can then be downloaded to a PC with a sound card and viewed as a spectrum or time series for analysis. It is necessary to examine both the spectrum and the time domain images when you are trying to evaluate what is going on. The main harmonic of an electrical emission (60 Hz in the USA, 50 Hz elsewhere) will be most prevalent in corona. As the condition becomes more severe, there will be fewer and fewer 60 Hz harmonics observed. As an example, arcing has very few 60-cycle components. Mechanical looseness will be &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; in 60 Hz harmonics and will have little frequency content between the 60 Hz peaks and will also demonstrate harmonics other than 60 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examining the time domain image can also be of help. In the case of corona, you will have a uniform band of signal with very few peaks that extend above the average &amp;ldquo;band.&amp;rdquo; With tracking, you will begin to see the peaks created by the discharges extend above the average &amp;ldquo;band.&amp;rdquo; With arcing, you will see several &amp;ldquo;bursts&amp;rdquo; of energy which correspond with the discharges. In all cases, both the spectrum and the time domain should be examined before the final determination is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below you will find examples of both the spectrum and time domain views for the varying degrees of severity of discharge to atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New online condition monitors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While a great majority of the inspections around energized electrical equipment incorporates portable instruments, these inspections are limited in their ability to protect equipment from failure or from an arc flash potential from going undetected. The limitations are time based. If an inspector is testing at the time any of these incidents is occurring, there is a good chance they will be detected and reported for corrective action. But, unlike mechanical conditions which are usually detected first and then trended to specific action levels, once arcing, tracking or corona are present, there is a potential for failure and arc flash that can occur at any time. Therefore, there is a need for continuous online monitoring of enclosed electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An electrical cabinet monitor is mounted on the internal side of a door or wall facing the components. Utilizing an airborne scanner, a threshold level is set. Should an event of arcing, tracking or corona occur, the sound level will be above the ambient threshold and be detected. A 4 to 20 milliamp (mA) or zero to 10 VDC output can be selected to carry the signal to an alarm mechanism or red light alert. In addition, these units contain a heterodyned signal to provide recording capability for recordkeeping and analysis purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advantage to online monitoring is obvious: it is not operator dependent and will continuously monitor. Whenever a condition occurs to produce the potential for arc flash or flashover, it will be sensed and alarmed instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound inspection is an effective screening tool for detecting the potential for arc flash incidents. When hand-held ultrasonic instruments are used to scan enclosed electrical apparatus the procedure is fast, accurate and simple. It can help inspectors by eliminating the need for wearing cumbersome, uncomfortable PPE during a preliminary survey. Online continuous monitors can alarm personnel of the presence of arcing, tracking and corona in advance of an inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note and references&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Flash over &lt;/strong&gt;(according to Merriam-Webster&amp;rsquo;s New Collegiate Dictionary) is an abnormal electrical discharge (as through the air to the ground from a high potential source or between two conducting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	portions of a structure).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasonic: A new method for condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;At the National Thermal Power Corporationâs Sipat plant in India, we are relying on only vibration measurement as a basic technique for condition monitoring of bearings. Sometimes infrared temperature detectors are also used, but their use becomes necessary mainly when temperature monitoring becomes important.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A new technique called ultrasonic condition monitoring is now available which can detect even incipient faults in bearings as well as adequacy of lubricant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;IRD measurements are generally not useful for very slow speeds, but ultrasonic detectors can be used even in slow-speed machines such as APH guide / support bearings, etc. This technology can be considered an integrating technology since it can be used with infrared and vibration inspections as well as stand alone to perform a multiplicity of inspection activities. Instruments based on this technology can monitor a wide range of plant operations and yet are simple enough to be used with minimal training for basic, effective inspection routines.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many failures and repairs that commonly occur in the industrial setting can be prevented with ultrasonic technology, a highly effective non-destructive, predictive maintenance method.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasonic leak detection is recommended by entities such as the U.S. Department of Energy as the best method for detecting the location of leaks in order to minimize energy waste and improve plant efficiency. Ultrasonic sensors designed with the right technology and software can be used for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. This will minimize production downtime, improve quality control and safety, and decrease man-hours by improving troubleshooting capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Consider the following summary from a third-party evaluation team for the integration of ultrasonic technology in a single organization with more than 500 sites:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;More than 100 applications were identified in use for various equipment at each site, such as boilers, heat exchangers, compressors, motors, pumps, valves and steam traps. 
&lt;LI&gt;The total savings for the organization would be approximately $3.7 million annually. 
&lt;LI&gt;The return on investment for the integration of ultrasound with this cost avoidance would be approximately 15:1. 
&lt;LI&gt;The annual man-year savings caused by the reduction of time spent diagnosing and troubleshooting would be approximately 45 man-years. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Overview of the technology&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lightweight and portable, ultrasonic translators are often used to inspect a wide variety of equipment. Some typical applications include: bearing inspection; testing gears/gearboxes; pumps; motors; steam trap inspection; valve testing; detection/trending of cavitation; compressor valve analysis; leak detection in pressure and vacuum systems such as boilers, heat exchangers, condensers, chillers, tanks, pipes, hatches, hydraulic systems, compressed air audits, specialty gas systems and underground leaks; and testing for arcing and corona in electrical apparatus.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What makes airborne ultrasound so effective?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All operating equipment and most leakage problems produce a broad range of sound. The high-frequency ultrasonic components of these sounds are extremely short wave in nature. A shortwave signal tends to be fairly directional. Therefore, it is relatively easy to detect its exact location by separating these signals from background plant and operating equipment noises. In addition, as changes begin to occur in mechanical equipment, the subtle, directional nature of ultrasound allows these potential warning signals to be detected early, before actual failure, often before they are detected by vibration or infrared.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Airborne ultrasound instruments, often referred to as âultrasonic translatorsâ, provide information three ways:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;qualitative&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the ability to âhearâ ultrasounds through a noise isolating headphone; 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;quantitative&lt;/STRONG&gt; via intensity (dB) readings on a meter or display panel; and, 
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;analytical&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the use of spectral analysis software to review recorded sound samples. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although the ability to gauge intensity and view sonic patterns is important, it is equally important to be able to âhearâ the ultrasounds produced by various equipment. That is precisely what makes these instruments so popular. They allow inspectors to confirm a diagnosis on the spot by being able to clearly discriminate among various equipment sounds. This is accomplished in most ultrasonic instruments by an electronic process called âheterodyningâ that accurately translates the ultrasounds sensed by the instrument into the audible range where users can hear and recognize them through headphones.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Condition Monitoring&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance have traditionally been performed through vibration analysis, infrared and other technologies. Ultrasonic technology is an excellent option, especially for organizations with lower budgets. Ultrasonic detectors are capable of accurately interpreting the sounds created by under-lubrication, over-lubrication and early signs of wear. The right ultrasonic technology is a fast and effective means of determining such conditions in moving, mechanical components such as bearings, gearboxes, motors, compressors, etc.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasound is produced by friction, impact, turbulence and electrical discharge. Friction and impact are the by-products of mechanical equipment. For example, a roller bearing will produce friction as the shaft and balls roll around the center. If there is too much friction, however, problems begin to occur on the equipment due to imbalance, or the bearing might seize, thereby shutting down equipment altogether.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Proper lubrication of critical bearings is important at all times. A properly lubricated bearing will produce a smooth rolling ultrasound, detectable by an ultrasonic receiver whose microphone can be placed in contact with the housing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the bearing is over-lubricated, very little ultrasound can be heard through the headset. If the bearing is under-lubricated, the intensity of the bearing will increase dramatically, and other sounds may be produced such as fluttering or scratchiness. Indications of an under-lubricated bearing will appear in ultrasound even before infrared can detect heat increases and well in advance of vibration analysis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition, once a bearing begins to wear, the ultrasonic wave will produce large spikes in the signal caused by flat spots or scratches on the race. The spikes are heard as pops or crackles through the headset. Once the ultrasound produced by the bearing begins to indicate these characteristics, the replacement of the bearing can be planned during normal production shutdown. The detection of wear is instantaneous. It is not necessary to take readings of the bearing from several points of contact along different axes and send the readings away for analysis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The use of ultrasound technology for condition monitoring does not need to be complex, however. Software may be used to record the output of the ultrasonic sensor. Once a baseline or benchmark signal of a component is recorded, future recordings may be compared to it in order to determine the wear or proper lubrication of the component over time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The basic advantages of ultrasound and ultrasonic instruments are:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They are directional and can be easily located. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They provide earliest warning of impending mechanical failure.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Many problems are only detectable in the ultrasonic range.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Audible noise is ignored, increasing the selectivity of the ability to pinpoint. Therefore, they are more accurate at pinpointing problems.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They can be used to locate leaks and potential electric failure conditions.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Instruments can be used in loud, noisy environments.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They support and enhance other predictive maintenance (PdM) technologies or can stand on their own in a maintenance program.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They are instantaneous in inferring diagnosis.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Isolation of faulty components, even internally, is possible.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;More versatile â Ultrasound can be used for several applications.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Non-destructive â Ultrasonic instruments do not adversely affect or interfere with the component under test.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Ultrasonic testing can be performed while the equipment is operating.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Maintenance personnel currently using IRD can easily use these equipments.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;They can detect even airborne sound waves from the equipment and many motor NDE bearings. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Airborne ultrasound translators are relatively simple to use. They consist of a basic handheld unit with headphones, a display panel, a sensitivity adjustment, and (most often) interchangeable modules that are used in either a scanning (airborne) mode or a contact (structure-borne) mode. Some instruments have the ability to adjust the frequency response from between 20 to 100 kilohertz (kHz). Ultrasound instruments may be analog or digital. Digital instruments indicate intensities as decibels. Digital instruments generally have onboard data logging with data management software to provide trending information and create alarm groups for equipment needing special attention. Some of the digital instruments also have on-board sound recording, which enables users to grab sound samples and review them on spectral analysis software.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Applications&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Generically, applications for ultrasonic translators fall under three basic categories: mechanical inspection, leak detection and electrical inspection.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Mechanical inspection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mechanical equipment produces a ânormalâ sound signature while operating effectively. As components begin to fail, a change in the original sonic signature occurs. This change can be noted as a shift in intensity on a display panel and/or as a qualitative sound change that can be heard through headphones and recorded for further analysis. An ultrasonic translator may be connected to a vibration analyzer, or the sound samples may be reviewed through spectral analysis software on a personal computer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to NASA research, âUltrasonic monitoring of bearings provides the earliest warning of bearing failure. They noted that an increase in amplitude of a monitored ultrasonic frequency of 12 decibels over baseline would indicate the initial (incipient) stages of bearing failure. This change is detected long before it is indicated by changes in vibration or temperature.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Other opportunities for ultrasonic mechanical inspection include: cavitation in pumps, compressor valve leakage, faulty gears, excessive rubbing and poor connections, to name a few.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Leak detection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The reason ultrasound is so versatile is that it detects the sound of a leak. When a fluid (liquid or gas) leaks, it moves from the high-pressure side of a leak through the leak site to the low-pressure side where it expands rapidly and produces a turbulent flow. This turbulence has strong ultrasonic components. The intensity of the ultrasonic signal falls off rapidly from the source. For this reason, the exact spot of a leak can be located. This can apply to pressure leaks, such as compressed air, and negative pressure (vacuum) leaks, leaks in valves and in steam traps.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reciprocating compressor valves are very noisy and produce a lot of extraneous vibration. By isolating the sound with the advantage of the shortwave nature of ultrasound, it is possible to listen to and view the sounds of these noisy valves in real time and to determine a leaking valve. As it opens and closes, there will be a definite, pronounced clicking sound, and sound from any leaking valve will be clearly distinguishable from normal valves. Similarly, many other steam, air and/or H2 leakages also can be located by these instruments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When a leak occurs, the turbulent flow produces sound pressure waves all along the spectrum from 0 hertz to100 kHz and beyond. Lower frequency sounds travel greater distances and interfere with ambient noise such as running machinery. Also, these sounds have greater energy and can easily reflect off surfaces, minimizing the ability of a low-frequency microphone to accurately locate the leak. High-frequency waves (those far above 40 kHz) do not have sufficient energy to be detectable from reasonable distances. An ultrasonic sensor that is used for the detection and location of leaks should:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Have a narrow bandwidth with center of frequency at 40 kHz 
&lt;LI&gt;Have a narrow directional pattern of reception 
&lt;LI&gt;Have controls for adjusting the sensitivity of the receiver in order to pinpoint location 
&lt;LI&gt;Have an analog meter that rapidly displays small changes in the input signal 
&lt;LI&gt;Have a good signal-to-noise ratio as noise will minimize the sensorâs ability to detect a leak 
&lt;LI&gt;Have a long battery life &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Electrical emissions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some preliminary experimentation has demonstrated that the main harmonic of an electrical emission (60 Hz in the USA, 50 Hz elsewhere) will be most prevalent in corona. As the condition becomes more severe, there will be fewer and fewer 60/50 Hz harmonics observed. As an example, arcing has very few 60/50-cycle components. Mechanical looseness will demonstrate harmonics other than 60/50 Hz with little to no frequency content between peaks.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lubrication&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the concept of âpredictiveâ lubrication vs. time-based (âpreventiveâ) lubrication has emerged, there are times when it is useful to use spectral analysis combined with sound. Instead of lubricating bearings on a routine, âtime-basedâ schedule, inspectors can routinely test bearings and identify those that need lubrication, leaving the others alone. In this manner, lubrication technicians can be taught how to effectively apply just enough lubricant to prevent over-lubrication.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When a bearing has exceeded a baseline by 8 dB with no change in acoustic quality, the bearing should be lubricated. While applying lubrication, the technician should stop when the sound level has dropped to the predetermined baseline level. A way to demonstrate this process is to view a sound image while noting changes in amplitude and listening to acoustic properties in real time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Spectral analysis software&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the introduction of spectral analysis software, a similar type of FFT diagnosis can be performed on a standard PC as long as the PC has a sound card. These programs not only provide the spectral and time series views of sound, but enable users to hear the sound samples simultaneously as they are viewing them on the PC monitor. Typically, a sound sample is recorded using an MP3 recorder or tape recorder. Some ultrasonic instruments have on-board sound recording, which can be downloaded to a PC via a compact flash card. When played back in real time, the acoustic properties can be analyzed. Based on a known âgoodâ or ânormalâ condition, an anomaly can be quickly determined.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, before going for this technology, we must consider the following turnkey implementation program for ultrasonic technology integration:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identify critical components and systems for testing 
&lt;LI&gt;Identify the right products such as sensors, software and accessories 
&lt;LI&gt;Identify test points and take initial readings for benchmarking 
&lt;LI&gt;Document test points, readings, components and products 
&lt;LI&gt;Train personnel to properly operate ultrasonic sensors and software in accordance to the documentation 
&lt;LI&gt;Establish attainable milestones for integration 
&lt;LI&gt;Maintain flexibility, expand product integration, and continue to evaluate key areas of integration including condition monitoring and leak detection &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Conclusion&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Airborne ultrasound instruments are becoming an important part of condition monitoring, fugitive emissions and energy conservation programs. Their versatility, ease of use and portability enable managers to effectively plan and implement inspection procedures. By locating leaks, detecting high-voltage electrical emissions and sensing early warning of mechanical failure, these instruments contribute to cost reductions, improved system efficiencies and reduced downtime. For optimum effectiveness, it is recommended that all major technologies â infrared, vibration and ultrasound â be used as part of a comprehensive inspection program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If properly implemented and used on a regular basis, ultrasound technology can be a fast, cost-effective means of monitoring critical components at our plants. The approach to implementation should include the right product, training of personnel, identification of critical components, benchmarking, and the determination to follow through on good intentions. A lack of training and understanding, irregular monitoring and a lack of commitment to the predictive maintenance program will lead to poor results. However, proper implementation of ultrasonic technology will increase reliability, decrease troubleshooting time, and decrease time spent putting out fires by our operation and maintenance staffs.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Why do steam traps fail? What can you do about it?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Properly functioning steam traps open to release condensate and automatically close when steam is present. Failed traps waste fuel, reduce efficiency, increase production costs and compromise the overall integrity of the steam and condensate systems. Traps should be tested on a regular basis â or the neglect may be quite costly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Failed steam traps negatively impact the entire steam system: They â¦&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Waste energy 
&lt;LI&gt;Adversely affect production 
&lt;LI&gt;Increase maintenance costs 
&lt;LI&gt;Create safety issues &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Steam energy conservation is important to our national interest; examine the government figures below:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;More than 45 percent of all the fuel burned by U.S. manufacturers is consumed to raise steam. Steam is used to heat raw materials and treat semi-finished products. It is also a power source for equipment, as well as for building heat and electricity generation. But steam is not free. It costs approximately $18 billion annually to feed the boilers generating steam. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Many manufacturing facilities can recapture energy through the installation of more efficient steam equipment and processes. A typical industrial facility can realize steam savings of 20 percent by improving their steam system. If steam system improvement were adopted industry-wide, the benefits would be $4 billion in fuel cost reduction and 32 million metric tons of emission reductions. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Source: U.S. Department of Energy. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;OK, so just why do steam traps fail?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Obviously, anything mechanical will malfunction; steam traps are no exception to the rule. Proper maintenance improves longevity and helps reduce maintenance costs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are three general conditions which adversely affect traps:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Dirt is by far the leading cause of failure, resulting in either a leaking or plugged trap. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Pressure surges (due to sudden steam valve openings, improper piping or trap misapplications) result in water hammer and subsequent damage to the internal steam trap components. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Over-sizing IB traps can lose their prime; TD traps can experience rapid cycling. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG border=0 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_uesystems02.jpg" width=280 height=210&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A 600 psi rated steam trap is being ultrasonically tested&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How do we keep problems to a minimum and keep energy costs in check? One simple way is to look for warning signs. Letâs review the most evident signs that should signal a distress call from your steam system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The once-lazy plume from your condensate stacks is now an out-of-control freight train. The steam that is standing at attention from your stack, like a soldier standing at attention, is costing you dearly. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Condensate back pressures that have slowly been rising have been causing your electric condensate pump to self-destruct. High-temperature condensate cannot be handled by conventional electric pumps. Temperatures over 212 degrees Fahrenheit cause conventional electric condensate return pumps to cavitate. Motors burn out and mechanical seals begin to leak when steam is present. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Pressure reducing valves (PRVs) or control valves fail to maintain set pressures. Fully or partially plugged traps prevent condensate from being eliminated from the steam space. Undrained condensate at PRV stations will back up into the steam line and will wiredraw the heads and seats of the reducing valves. Wiredrawing is when high-velocity water in the steam system cuts (scores) the surfaces of heads and seats. Even small microscopic cuts will prevent the proper operation of these valves. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;A production capability has been reduced. Open or closed traps that have failed will negatively impact production. Plugged traps will back condensate up into the process and dramatically reduce system efficiency. Blowing and leaking traps are costly to production due to the added and unnecessary energy consumption. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Pipe wall thickness of the condensate system has become an issue. Fully open or partially opened steam traps that are not repaired in a timely manner will deteriorate the condensate return piping. Some of the early warning signs begin with steam leaks. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost to maintain heat exchanger bundles, humidifiers, HVAC coils and other equipment has dramatically increased. Failed traps will prevent proper operation of sensitive equipment. When steam traps fail in a closed position, over time, the stagnant condensate will turn to carbonic acid (CO3). Carbonic acid will deteriorate all the metal with which it comes in contact. Beyond increased energy consumption, failed open traps also will cause control and efficiency issues. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Water hammer can develop in neglected or mismanaged steam and condensate systems. Water hammer literally sounds like someone is hitting a pipe with a hammer. In some cases, water hammer can occur when a portion of the steam condenses into water within steam piping. Left undrained, condensate will spill into the steam system and begin to accumulate. Eventually, a wave of water will be created. This slug of water can be carried at high velocity until it reaches an obstruction like a closed valve, a lower elevation or a sudden change of direction. A trap that is blowing steam can also cause water hammer. Blowing traps create back-pressure in the condensate system piping. If condensate piping is already undersized, the problem will be compounded by the additional pressures found by the faulty traps. Undrained condensate can back up into the steam distribution piping. From the standpoint of plant safety, it is essential to test and maintain the steam trap population. Type âsteam water hammer accidents and fatalitiesâ into a search engine. The results should be convincing enough to create an immediate action plan. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG hspace=12 align=middle src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_uesystems04.jpg" width=280 height=283&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;After an ultrasonic test found the trap to be blowing, the downstream condensate line was shut and the test valve was opened to verify test results. The system pressure was 270 psi. At the cost of $10 per thousand pounds of steam produced, the energy loss for this single blowing trap is $21,000.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The action plan&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Perform a regularly scheduled steam trap survey. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identify system design issues. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Perform an insulation audit. Areas where insulation has been removed and never replaced will significantly add to your overall steam production costs. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Using ultrasound detection equipment, test bypass valves if they exist in your steam system. They may be leaking through when they ought to be shut. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Turn off seasonally operated equipment such as unit heaters. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Periodically test control valves or shut off valves in the HVAC system with a hand-held IR temperature instrument and an ultrasonic leak detector. If they are even partially leaking through, they are adding to overall energy costs. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Audit the system and unused inventory equipment. Remove defunct systems. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Whenever possible and practical, use a computerized system to control and monitor processes. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Purchase proper test equipment&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Even if outside technical professionals are contracted to test the steam system, from time to time, a problem will occur. Time is money. Having the proper equipment and just one trained employee can avoid costly downtime. The two basic pieces of equipment to own are an infrared thermometer and an airborne ultrasonic instrument. Such equipment is readily available in all price ranges. A thermometer with simple features is fine; however, an ultrasonic listening device should be selected more carefully and must have clear signal quality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is similar to purchasing an audio system for your home and comparing one set of speakers with another set. When listening to a quality speaker system, the nuances of what was actually recorded open your ears to a new level of listening.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;The same is true of listening to a steam trap. With a fine instrument, you can even hear the snap-crackle-pop of steam passing across the head and seat of a wiredrawn inverted bucket trap. After all, âhearing is believing.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Before you begin&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Before you spend your hard-earned money, consider some of the following characteristics of the ultrasound instrument: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;How is the sound quality heard through the headphones (external speakers will be hard to use in most steam environments)? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Does it lack in versatility? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Will it include the ability to change frequencies and test modules? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Is it heavy and/or awkward to handle when up on a ladder? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Does it have an extended warranty period? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Is there proper technical support via phone or in the field? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Can batteries be easily charged and replaced? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Are trial rentals available? &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Purchasing an ultrasound device should take intelligent consideration. The instrument must be capable of providing you a clear and discernable signal quality. Labor hours and equipment costs depend on it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Why use ultrasound to test traps?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Of all the inspection methods, ultrasound is the most recommended and reliable. Ultrasound is a shortwave, high-frequency signal that does not travel far from its source. By listening to the ultrasonic components of a working steam trap, a user can isolate the signal and easily identify operational sounds. Ultrasonic testers translate high-frequency emissions generated from the mechanical and fluid flows of traps into the audible range where they are heard through headphones and seen as intensity levels on a meter. Some units have frequency tuning to filter out additional signals and to tune in to the sounds of steam and condensate. Testing steam traps with ultrasound provides results in real time. It isolates the area being tested by eliminating confusing background noises. A user can quickly adjust to recognizing differences among various steam traps.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ultrasonic detector may be the easiest to use, most flexible and most accurate of the sound testing methods. However, the ultrasonic instrument cannot tell if a trap is cold or blocked. Therefore, first use a temperature indicator instrument to be certain that the system is operating. Then use the ultrasound instrument to determine if the trap is partially blocked or if back pressure exists at the traps outlet.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The importance of qualitative SDT methods in acoustic lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Friction between a bearingâs rolling elements and races produces ultrasonic sound which has an amplitude level directly proportional to the friction. This relationship is the fundamental principle for acoustic lubrication. As the lubricant film becomes less effective at separating the metallic surfaces, friction increases in concert with the measurable ultrasonic amplitude. Restoring the lubrication film will decrease the friction and, consequently, the amplitude. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lubrication technicians use ultrasonic detectors equipped with special contact probes to evaluate &lt;EM&gt;qualitatively&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;quantitatively&lt;/EM&gt; the state of lubrication in rolling element bearings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Qualitative evaluation depends on the ears of the inspector to judge what is heard through the headphones of the ultrasound detector. Using his own criteria, experience and best judgment, the lube tech listens to the ultrasonic signal of the bearing and decides if it requires greasing and, if so, how much grease to add.&amp;nbsp;While there is an art to this method, there may not be very much science. The reality is that all bearings produce some level of ultrasound and, in certain situations, it is hard to evaluate if the sound is normal or abnormal, simply based on what was heard. Furthermore, it is impossible to baseline, compare or consult because it is absolutely possible for two people to hear the same signal in completely different ways. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are acoustic devices available on the market that are based solely on qualitative interpretation. Greasing decisions should not be based on hearing alone, but rather on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Quantitative evaluation is the science that makes ultrasound effective for acoustic lubrication. By the very definition of the word, âquantitativeâ suggests some level of measurement, benchmarking and trending will help decide conclusively the lubrication needs of the bearing. Quantitative can refer to static measurements where digital decibel metering is used for trending. Or, it can go a step further and refer to Ultranalysis, the science of analysing dynamic ultrasonic signals in the time and spectrum domains. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Static dBÂµV measurements are the standard best practice for lube techs, and Dynamic Ultranalysis is the advanced best practice. Where static measurements are well established and understood, dynamic measurement methods are in their infancy and a lot of the rules are still being written. But that is a discussion for a future article. For now, let us focus on static digital dBÂµV testing (SDT). With SDT, methods lube techs can: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Define numerical values for amplitude (baseline) VS time &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Write acoustic lubrication best practice procedures that anyone can follow &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Eliminate the human factor due to differences in hearing perception and ability between two technicians &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Create a source of historical information to optimize lubrication and identify problems &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

            <title>Using ultrasound to locate low-level leaks in heat exchangers</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Ultrasonic leak detection has been used for a variety of applications ranging from energy reduction by locating compressed air leaks to quality assurance inspections such as locating wind noise and water leaks in automobiles. The secret to success is to understand the nature of what type of leak produces a detectible ultrasound and what does not, along with the techniques that can be used for effective leak identification. Once understood, there are instances where the limits of detection can be enhanced to help locate a leak in difficult situations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Typically, ultrasound leak detection is used to locate leaks where the pressure differential is enough to produce a turbulent flow as the gas moves from the high-pressure to the low-pressure side of a leak. Most often, any leak with a rate below 1x10-3 std. cubic centimeter per second will not generate a detectable, turbulent flow. For this reason, the majority of leak applications for ultrasound are limited to leaks above this threshold. One of the advantages of ultrasound is that leak detection is not limited to a specific fluid. The technology is open to identifying leaks in all types of gas and even fluid systems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When confronted with a potentially difficult situation that involved locating low-level leaks in a particular shell-in-tube heat exchanger they were fabricating, Dan Rennert of Mason Manufacturing decided to investigate ultrasound. Having used the technology for a previous employer, Rennert was aware of the potential for success as well as the downside. He understood that ultrasound instruments detect a turbulent flow, and that to produce this turbulence, the flow rate would have to be in excess of some of the types of leaks he suspected heâd need to find. He had performed a standard hydrostatic test on the exchanger and did locate several leaks, but felt there might be more, smaller leaks present.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mason Manufacturing fabricates a variety of pressure vessels and heat exchangers for chemical, food and grain processors. Some of their clients are very demanding in terms of the quality of products they order. They expect Mason Manufacturing to deliver a leak-free product, and Mason in turn pursues all options to meet these demands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rennert considered utilizing helium testing, which he felt would find smaller leaks than ultrasound typically can sense. His concern was two-fold: the proximity of the tubes and the time it would take to identify the leaks. Typically, helium detection is time-consuming in that the sensor has to be carefully manipulated around the test area. In addition, there is the potential for confusion should the helium from one site drift to the sensor as it is scanning an adjacent site. In this instance, the tubes in the heat exchanger were in close proximity. There was a 3/8-inch distance between tubes, which could make identification of a particular leaking tube difficult. This was a large exchanger with more than 8,000 tubes in a 15- to 16-foot diameter tube sheet with the tubes extending several inches from the tube sheet. The time it would take to manipulate a sensor around this configuration could take days for completion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since Rennert had decided to investigate the use of ultrasound leak detection for this application, he consulted with Mark Goodman, vice president of engineering at UE Systems. Goodman agreed with Rennertâs concern that the leaks might not produce enough detectable ultrasound since they were slow forming and low level. He suggested that they use a method called âLiquid Leak Amplificationâ. This incorporates the use of a surfactant with low surface tension. The heat exchanger is pressurized and the liquid is applied to sections of the tube sheet. This is similar in nature to the typical âbubble testâ, with one exception. The fluid used has low surface tension so that a low-flow leak will form a bubble that will burst almost immediately. This produces a detectable ultrasound. Standard soap and commercially formulated bubble test solutions when used on low-level leaks (typically below 1x10-3 cc/sec) will take a much longer time to form bubbles and an even longer time for the bubble to burst. Plus, with unusual configurations such as in this case, where the tubes extended beyond the tube sheet, the bubbles would not be seen and, therefore, the leak would not be detected. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rennert decided to try the Liquid Leak Amplification method. He pressurized the heat exchanger to about 50 pounds per square inch (psi) and sprayed the Liquid Leak Amplifier on 4-foot square sections of the exchanger tube sheet. It is usual with this procedure to have a number of bubbles form upon contact with the tube sheet, so he waited until the initial formation of bubbles subsided. Rennert then plugged in the scanning module and began to scan along the tube sheet section with the ultrasonic sensor. He repeated this process of spraying the liquid onto one 4-foot section at a time, waiting and scanning. He identified the leaks by detecting what he describes as a slow âpop-popâ sound occurring about 1 to 2 seconds apart. While he did not see the bubbles, he was able to confirm the leak by noting that the popping sounds did not occur around any adjacent tubes. It took him only eight hours to complete the scan of 8,000 tubes. Three leaks were identified in addition to those he had located previously with the hydrostatic test. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Convinced that he had found and repaired all the leaks, he sent the heat exchanger to his customer. It would have been extremely expensive for Masonâs customer if it had a leak in the heat exchanger, since the leak would have contaminated the companyâs product. With this procedure, Mason was able to deliver a leak-free heat exchanger to a very satisfied customer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the future, Rennert anticipates using ultrasound for large exchangers in order to be sure that the gaskets are tight. They will use it before a hydro test on these exchangers. As Rennert explained, âIf you have an exchanger thatâs 10 to 11 feet in diameter and fill it up with water, thatâs a lot of water.â Rennert estimates that this will save them many gallons of water. His procedure will be to add 5 psi of air after the gasket has been installed and test with Liquid Leak Amplifier.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since he had used the ultrasound equipment previously in a chemical plant testing for steam leaks, he was familiar enough with the technology to adapt it to his current position. He anticipates using ultrasound in the shop to cut energy waste by locating air leaks. In fact, he recently walked along one area in his plant near a wall and found leaks in the airline, a crack in the housing of an air dryer and another leak in an air hose.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One word of caution, any method established for leak detection has its benefits and its limitations. Leak detection is generally âhard workâ. It requires knowledge of the test subject, test conditions and an understanding of the type of leak to be detected. For example:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Is it a liquid or a gas? 
&lt;LI&gt;Is it a slow-forming leak or a high-flow leak? &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once understood, the inspector must then decide on the technology and method best suited for the particular leak. It also requires strategy for preparation, safety, application, identification and confirmation of the leak. Some types of testing might need to conform to specific codes and standards. In addition, a method for leak management must be implemented so that the leaks are not only identified but also repaired and rechecked for quality assurance. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;About the author:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Alan S.

            <title>Ultrasonic technology for lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Reliability in Action department features case studies submitted by our readers. To have your article considered for inclusion in a future issue, e-mail it to &lt;A href="mailto:parnold@noria.com"&gt;parnold@noria.com&lt;/A&gt;. This issue's article was written by Dave Garner, the global solutions development manager for Dow Corning Molykote:&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A successful lubrication program rests on one basic concept: the correct amount of the correct lubricant at the correct place at the correct time. For anyone who has spent time in a maintenance or reliability role, this is not as simple as it sounds. Today, ultrasonic technology provides pump and system pros unparalleled insight into the condition of the lubricant in an operating unit of machinery. As lubrication quality diminishes during operation, friction creates vibratory energy at a frequency around 30 kilohertz (kHz), creating an ultrasonic beacon. Devices are available to measure and record ultrasonic signals, and "shift" (or heterodyne) the ultrasonic signal down into the audible range. This lets you hear the otherwise inaudible, tell-tale signal of inadequate lubrication. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200801_Reli_Action-Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ultrasonic readings taken on a dry screw vacuum pump show a 7 dB rise and subsequent return to normal after bearing relubrication. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By taking periodic ultrasonic measurements and trending those values, you can gain insight into the actual condition of the machine's lubricating system during operation. Typically, bi-weekly or monthly ultrasonic readings are taken and trended. Ultrasonic emission increases of around 7 decibels (dB) indicate the lubricant has depleted to a point where friction has notably increased. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasonic technology is also useful in preventing over-lubrication. As the grease is pumped in, ultrasonic levels reduce to a point at which a squirt of grease results in a slight increase in dB. After the slight increase, the dB level resumes its decline until an additional squirt results in another slight increase followed by another decline. Subsequent squirts of grease are added until the levels increase and do not decline. This indicates that the bearing cavity is filled to the point that the rolling elements are continuously plowing through the new grease. Additional grease will over-lubricate the system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Figure2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200801_Reli_Action-Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Infrared images taken before and after relubrication. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pros responsible for a facility's lubrication face challenges ranging from simple lubricant storage to procurement and application engineering. Often, fundamental concepts of lubrication get lost in the cultural practices and plant procedures intended to provide reliability. Ultrasonics help you deliver the correct amount of the correct lubricant to the correct place at the correct time, extending machinery reliability, reducing waste and minimizing costs. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/ultrasonic_inspection/~4/B6_YPK8Mjf8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How are you using ultrasonic analysis?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;My focus this issue will be on airborne and structure-borne ultrasonic analysis. We refer to it as such because we need to distinguish this type of ultrasonic analysis from pulse-echo ultrasound. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Airborne and structure-borne ultrasound is sometimes referred to as passive ultrasound. This is because the source of the ultrasound isn't coming from the ultrasonic meter but from the component being analyzed (e.g. pump bearing, steam trap or high-voltage switchgear). Pulse-echo ultrasound is active ultrasound, named for the fact that the meter/sensor combination is the source of the ultrasound. The signal is generated from the sensor and transmitted into a material. This is done to measure material thickness and/or detect subsurface discontinuities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the rest of this article, I will concentrate on passive ultrasound and refer to it simply as "ultrasonics". Ultrasonic analysis has a wide variety of uses. There are numerous examples of applications for detecting failure modes on mechanical, electrical and stationary equipment. The technology is powerful and flexible in that numerous failure modes can be detected on different types of components. It's easy to implement (relative to other technologies) in that a single four-day class is all most people need to start detecting machinery defects. And, it is affordable (relative to other technologies). You can buy a basic ultrasonic device for less than $2,000. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The data collection methods determine the types of detectable failure modes. The two methods are contact (structure-borne) and non-contact (airborne). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Contact methods are typically used for mechanical applications such as bearing faults, lubrication issues, gear damage and pump cavitation. What did you notice about these four faults? What do they have in common? They are all defects that give off high-frequency noise (vibration). We have now discovered one of the limitations of ultrasonic analysis. It's only capable of detecting high-frequency defects. This is a function of how the ultrasonic meter works. By manipulating the ultra-high-frequency sounds, the meter makes it possible for us to hear them. So, the meter was designed specifically for high-frequency sounds. Low-frequency faults like imbalance, misalignment, looseness and coupling issues can't be detected using ultrasonics. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Contact methods are also very useful for detecting electrical faults on motors. Motors with problems like loose/broken rotor bars produce a very high-frequency, rhythmic pattern that is easily detected with the ultrasonic meter. As for stationary applications with contact methods, steam traps are a very common application. Steam traps that have failed often are "blowing by" (steam constantly leaks past the internal seals) and parts of the trap may be rattling. Both of these produce ultrasonic noise that can be detected through contact measurements. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Uses for non-contact measurements include pressure and vacuum leaks on compressed gas (including air) systems and numerous electrical applications. Airborne ultrasonic analysis is the perfect way to find compressed gas leaks. Air leak surveys, as they are often referred to, can produce big money-saving opportunities in the form of reduced production costs for compressed air and extended compressor rebuild schedules. The most well-known electrical application is the use of airborne ultrasonics to detect the presence of arcing, tracking and corona in high-voltage electrical apparatus. This is especially powerful as infrared thermography can't detect arcing and tracking and can only detect corona under very special circumstances. This makes the use of airborne ultrasonics a key part of your electrical asset health program. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another application that is often overlooked is the use of airborne ultrasonics as an added safety measure when opening electrical cabinets. An example of this might be during a routine IR thermography scan. Pre-screen the cabinet doors with an ultrasonic meter to detect any arcing that may be occurring in the breaker or starter. This arcing will ionize the air inside the cabinet. When the cabinet door is opened, the fresh air becomes a welcomed path to ground, producing an extremely dangerous arc flash. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These are just a few applications for ultrasonics. How many of these does your program have? Does your equipment maintenance plan call for the use of this highly flexible, very capable and quite affordable technology? Are these tools available to operators and crafts personnel for daily inspections and troubleshooting? Or, are they solely the domain of the condition monitoring personnel?&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The word on ultrasonic monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Ultrasound inspection offers a unique position for condition monitoring as both a "stand-alone" inspection technology and as an effective screening tool that can speed up the inspection process and help inspectors determine effective follow-up actions for mechanical, electrical and leak applications. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whether you refer to proactive inspections as "predictive maintenance" or "condition monitoring," the goal is the same - to note a deviation from a normal or baseline condition in order to determine whether or not to take corrective action in a planned orderly manner and to prevent an unplanned incident. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ideal end result is to maintain asset availability, reduce maintenance overhead and improve safety conditions. Not one technology can cover everything. The recommendation is to incorporate as many technologies as possible into inspection procedures to assure reliable results. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This paper will review the basics of ultrasound technology, what is new to the technology and how it is used for condition monitoring to locate safety hazards, reduce energy waste and improve equipment availability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Ultrasonic1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200703_Applied_Reli_Ultrasonic1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Photo 1. Ultrasonic instruments can help your maintenance organization become more proactive and accurate. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;ULTRASOUND &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;TECHNOLOGY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Airborne/structure-borne ultrasound instruments receive high-frequency sounds produced by operating equipment, electrical emissions and leaks. These frequencies typically range from 20 to 100 kilohertz and are beyond the range of human hearing. The instruments electronically translate ultrasound frequencies, through a process called heterodyning, down into the audible range where they are heard through headphones and observed as intensity and/or decibel (dB) levels on a display panel. The newer digital instruments utilize data management software where information is data-logged on the instrument and downloaded to a computer for analysis. Some instruments contain on-board sound recording to capture sound samples for spectral analysis. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What makes airborne ultrasound so effective? All operating mechanical equipment, electrical emissions (arcing, tracking, corona) and most leakage problems produce a broad range of sound. The high-frequency ultrasonic components of these sounds are extremely short-wave in nature. A short-wave signal tends to be fairly directional and localized. It is, therefore, easy to separate these signals from background plant noises and to detect their exact location. In addition, as subtle changes begin to occur in mechanical equipment, the subtle, directional nature of ultrasound allows these potential warning signals to be detected early, before actual failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of the sounds sensed by humans range between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz (20 to 20,000 cycles per second). The average human high-frequency threshold is actually 16.5 kHz. These frequencies tend to be relatively large when compared with the sound waves sensed by ultrasonic translators. The lengths of low-frequency sound waves in the audible range are approximately 1.9 centimeters (3/4 of an inch) up to 17 meters (56 feet), whereas ultrasound wavelengths sensed by ultrasonic translators are only 0.3 cm (1/8") up to 1.6 cm (5/8") long. Since ultrasound wavelengths are magnitudes smaller, the "ultrasonic environment" is much more conducive to locating and isolating the source of problems in loud plant environments. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The high-frequency, short-wave characteristic of ultrasound enables users to accurately pinpoint the location of a leak, electrical emission or a particular sound in a machine. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The basic advantages of ultrasound and ultrasonic instruments are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasound emissions are directional. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasound tends to be highly localized. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ultrasound provides early warning of impending mechanical failure. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The instruments can be used in loud, noisy environments. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;They support and enhance other predictive maintenance technologies or can stand on their own in a maintenance program. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When used as part of a condition monitoring program, ultrasound instruments help improve asset availability and save energy. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once established, ultrasound can be used as the first line of defense to: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;quickly inspect equipment &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;screen out anomalies &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;set up alarm groups for detailed analysis and further action &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the most recent advances over the past few years, ultrasonic detectors have become much more sophisticated and have gone from just a listening device that is quite subjective to a system that can store test data, record sound samples and analyze both the data through data management software and the recorded sound samples with spectral analysis software. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With these new advances, using ultrasound to separate good operating equipment from bad is as easy as 1, 2, 3. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Listen and observe. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Note deviations and record the translated ultrasonic signal. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Analyze and review. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let's examine the possibilities of what can be done to save time, locate deviations and save energy. First, listen to the translated ultrasound and observe the decibel level. Note any deviations from previous readings as you continue your route. Record the data and any sound anomalies. Then, analyze the data and sounds to consider if additional action is necessary. All of this can be accomplished very quickly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here are a few case studies of how ultrasound helped avoid equipment breakdown. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Ultrasonic2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200703_Applied_Reli_Ultrasonic2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 2. Spectrum of inner bearing. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;COMPRESSOR VALVE LEAK DETECTION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a shutdown scheduled with very little advanced notice, a major mining operation had to determine ways to reduce the manpower requirements on their preventive maintenance schedule. Normally, it changed out all of the valves on its large (2,000-horsepower) compressor, but the site decided to use ultrasound as a method of determining which valves to change, and thus reduce the manpower requirements. After checking the valves, it found that only a small fraction of the valves needed to be changed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure1.gif src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200703_Applied_Reli_Figure1.gif"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. UE-UT reading on outboard and inboard oil pump bearings. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;MAIN POWER TRANSFORMER ANOMALY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A main power transformer for a large utility began to show signs of heating up with infrared scans on the top of the transformer near two of the three output insulators. It was decided to investigate the oil recirculating pumps to see if they were possibly the problem. These pumps had been in service for seven years and had an expected life of more than 10 years. An ultrasonic scan of both the inboard and outboard bearings on several transformer oil pumps of the same age found that most had readings of 20 to 30 dB. Twelve of the 14 pumps on the suspect main transformer had readings in the range of 50 to 70 dB. The increase of 30 to 35 dB in only these 12 oil pumps out of more than 100 oil pumps tested was considered to be very unusual, and needed further investigation. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These decibel readings on the oil pump inner and outer bearings give the ultrasound operator excellent information about what might be causing the higher temperature readings on the top of the transformer and subsequent high gas readings. They can be used to help evaluate risk of going to higher loads. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Figure 2 (on Page 40) is a time series image of the inner bearing wave file. It is very close to the pump outflow, and from the "spikes" that come considerably above the baseline, it is easy to see that there is a high probability that there is cavitation occurring at the pump output. This has initiated further action to determine if the high decibel readings were caused by the pumps being wired incorrectly, causing the pump to rotate backward. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;FAULTY GEARS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An ultrasonic signal viewed through a vibration analyzer can help isolate faulty gears. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The time waveforms at below (figures 3 and 4) were taken on identical gearboxes in a tubing manufacturing facility. There are six gearboxes coupled together, each driving tooling that bends steel to form tubing. The inspector was out collecting data with a vibration analyzer and an ultrasound instrument when he came across the following gearboxes. A vibration time waveform was taken with an accelerometer. When listening to the gearboxes with the ultrasonic instrument, most of them had a hissing type sound. One gearbox had a ticking sound to it and was captured in a time waveform first using an accelerometer and then with the ultrasonic instrument. These were then compared to the gearbox right beside it. The time waveforms in figures 3 and 4 show the results. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By comparing the two time waveforms, a slight difference in the two gearboxes can be observed. Note the time waveforms that were captured with ultrasound in figures 5 and 6. The problem becomes more defined. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ultrasonics time waveform shows the broken tooth or teeth in Gearbox A. By the use of ultrasonics, this problem was caught in an earlier stage. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;ELECTRICAL INSPECTION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ultrasound instruments detect ionization produced by arcing, tracking and corona, and can be used to locate problems in all voltages with the majority of applications in the mid- to high-voltage range. While infrared is typically used to locate electrical problems, there are "sound" events that could go undetected when relying on infrared thermography alone. Enclosed cabinets can be scanned, transformers can be probed and corona can be detected in high-voltage equipment. Sound samples can be recorded for analysis and spectral or time series views placed in reports. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The images at left demonstrate the effectiveness of ultrasound when used with infrared. An inspector who utilizes both ultrasound and infrared technologies was inspecting switchgear. Some of the doors could not be opened. There were no infrared ports on the closed cabinets and, therefore, this switchgear couldn't be tested with infrared. By scanning the door seams and air vents with the ultrasound instrument, the inspector heard a very distinctive arcing sound. He recorded the sound, and after the cabinets were opened, he took visual and infrared images. The results are displayed in figures 7 and 8. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The infrared image (Figure 9) shows that this failure condition could have resulted in flashover at any moment, which would have produced a catastrophic event. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;LEAK DETECTION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The category of leak detection covers a wide area of plant operations. It can be looked upon as a way of keeping a system running more efficiently. Some plants include leak detection as part of an energy conservation program, while others perform leak detection for safety purposes or to reduce an environmental impact. No matter what, leaks can cost money, affect product quality and can wreak havoc with the environment. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reason ultrasound instruments are so versatile is that they detect the sound of a leak and are not limited to just one type of leak. Leakage can occur in liquid or gas systems, pressurized and vacuum systems, internally (in valves or behind walls) or externally (through exposed piping). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For those instances where no pressure or vacuum can be created, an ultrasonic tone test can be used. An ultrasonic transmitter is placed on one side of a test item to flood an area with ultrasound. By scanning on the other side for sonic penetration, a leak can be located. As an example, this is used in the transportation industry to locate wind noise and water leaks around windshields. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The most common leak detection applications are used to save energy by locating compressed air and steam leaks. The U.S. Department of Energy has programs to help industry reduce energy loss through the Compressed Air Challenge, Steam Challenge and Motor Challenge.

&lt;P&gt;Compressed air is one of the most costly utilities in plants today. The Department of Energy estimates that upward of 30 percent of all compressed air produced in the U.S. is lost to leaks. An ultrasonic compressed air leak survey can offer fast payback. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is not uncommon to read of reports demonstrating savings in the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars from compressed air leak surveys. A recent survey at a manufacturing plant is a typical example. This plant averaged an electric cost of $1.76 million to generate compressed air. The survey identified 3,561 leaks totaling 6,340 cubic feet per minute at an annualized cost of $597,000 of energy waste. A program of leak detection and repair can have a dramatic effect on the profitability of a company such as this. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Steam is another costly utility. Leaks in a steam system add to the energy cost. In fact, leaking steam traps not only waste energy, they can cause water hammer, which can damage steam system components and add to the operating costs. One steam trap can leak an average of 43 tons of steam per year. A steam leak and steam trap survey can provide substantial savings. One chemical company reported that the results of a steam trap survey in one of its plants demonstrated a savings of $1 million. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With escalating energy costs, the impact is affecting not only the bottom line but jobs. A recent National Association of Manufacturing newsletter reported that many companies are forced to cut jobs due to the high cost of energy. They mentioned that "energy prices have been a primary factor in the loss of 100,000 jobs in the chemical industry alone." &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ultrasound condition monitoring provides many opportunities to improve asset availability, keep production on schedule and save energy. Applications for mechanical analysis, electrical inspection and leak detection cover just about all plant equipment. The basic ultrasonic instrument is relatively easy to use, while advancements in the technology have helped improve data management, analysis and reporting. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With escalating energy costs, ultrasonic technology can provide a cost-effective approach to reducing energy waste in compressed air and steam systems. &lt;/P&gt;
