		<description>LUXEMBOURG&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The European Union on Thursday won a key legal round against US airlines fighting EU plans to force foreign carriers to buy carbon permits to fly to and out of the 27-nation bloc.

An EU system that will require airlines to pay for their CO2 emissions from January 1 "is compatible with international law," the advocate general of the EU Court of Justice, Juliane Kokott, wrote in a legal opinion.

The opinion is a blow to US airlines, which argued that the rules violated international climate ...</description>

		<description>MOSCOW&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia had no immediate plans to break up its natural gas export monopoly despite growing pressure from the European Union.

Putin's comments at a Moscow investment forum came one week after EU officials searched the office of Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom as part of an unprecedented anti-trust probe.

The Russian premier and overwhelming frontrunner in March presidential elections accused the European Union of using the raids to put f...</description>

		<description>ANKARA&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Turkey will continue searching for gas and oil in the Mediterranean waters, where the rival Cyprus government has already started drilling, the Turkish energy minister said.

"We will not leave the Mediterranean. There are zones that we had spotted earlier," Energy Minister Taner Yildiz was quoted as saying by the Anatolia news agency on Thursday.

"We could shift the weight (for gas and oil seach) from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean," he said.

Moody's "has today downgraded the long-term senior unsecured ratings of ENI and its guaranteed subsidiaries to A1 from Aa3", the ratings agency said.

		<description>PANAMA CITY&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The world remains far away from meeting UN-backed goals on holding back climate change, setting the stage for major damage without more ambitious efforts to cut emissions, a study said Tuesday.

Scientists who support climate action said that China, the largest source of carbon blamed for rising temperatures, is on track to surpass its own targets but that its overall emissions are growing more quickly than thought.

"Decreasing dependence on Russian arms exports and a growing number of alternative energy suppliers mean that China has taken the upper hand in the relationship," the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in a report released Monday.

A key to the changing dynamic, the report said, is that China "is...</description>

		<description>PARIS&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The ability of forests, plants and soil to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air has been under-estimated, according to a study on Wednesday that challenges a benchmark for calculating the greenhouse-gas problem.

Like the sea, the land is a carbon "sink", or sponge, helping to absorb heat-trapping CO2 disgorged by the burning of fossil fuels.

A conventional estimate is that soil and vegetation take in roughly 120 billion tonnes, or gigatonnes, of carbon each year through the natural proce...</description>

"Such an investigation, however it ends, is symbolically important and meaningful as the beginning of common energy policy," President Dalia Grybauskaite told reporters.

Lithuania has locked horns with Gazprom, its only gas supplier, over what it claims is unfair pricing -- a charge the Russian group denies.

		<description>WASHINGTON,  USA&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;The World Bank and IMF are proposing global carbon taxes on aviation and ship fuels in developed economies to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, according to a draft proposal seen by AFP Friday.

The proposal suggests an international charge on aviation and maritime bunker fuels of $25 per ton of CO2, which it said would "reduce CO2 emissions from each sector by around five to 10 percent."

Such a charge, if implemented well, could also bring in $250 billion in taxes in 2020, according to...</description>

		<description>haining,  China&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;A major anti-pollution protest has forced the Chinese government to take swift action for the second time in as many months, spurred by a rising environment movement that is spreading online.

More than 500 residents living near a plant making solar panels protested for three days last week in the eastern city of Haining, forcing authorities to temporarily shut the factory, which belongs to the US-listed Jinko Solar.

The incident came just over a month after authorities in the northeastern ...</description>

		<description>ANKARA&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Turkey threatened Monday to start oil and gas exploration "very soon" and under naval escort in the eastern Mediterranean, after the Greek Cypriots said they had already started their own operations.

"His reason is that he takes issue with APS's stance on climate change."

		<description>SYDNEY&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon on Thursday singled out sustainable development as the top issue facing the planet with the world's seven billionth person expected to be born next month.

Key to this was climate change, and he said time was running out with the population set to explode this century.

"Next month, the seven billionth citizen of our world will be born," the UN secretary general said during a speech at Sydney University.

Ban stopped in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati on his way to New Zealand for the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and described the two small nations as "on the front line" of the climate change issue.

At a joint press conference with Prime Minister Julia Gillard in Canberra, Barroso welcomed the divisive levy, which has driven thousands to attend anti-carbon tax rallies and call for new general elections.

On current trends, Asia will make up half the world's economic output by 2050, and another three billion people will have joined the ranks of the affluent, their incomes matching those of Europe today, said the report.

But the ADB study also pointed to a paradox -- the fact that the world's fastest-growing r...</description>
