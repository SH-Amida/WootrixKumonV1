            <title>Lower Costs through Green HVAC</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For years, environmentalists have been pushing for changes to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) standards, hoping to make them less harmful for the environment. While creating a safer environment is great, in the business world, money talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you own a business, a large chunk of your business dollar is probably going to heating and cooling. However, there are many actions you can take to not only make your building&amp;#39;s heating and cooling systems more eco-friendly and energy efficient but also save you money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any time you can lessen the load on your HVAC system while maintaining the building&amp;#39;s internal temperature will obviously save you some dough, but it isn&amp;#39;t all about the machinery. There are things you can do &amp;mdash; or encourage your tenants to do &amp;mdash; beyond&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.grainger.com/category/hvac-and-refrigeration/ecatalog/N-k00"&gt;HVAC maintenance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to get more ecological benefit from your money while managing your energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of these actions, along with some pertinent information about energy use in general, are outlined in the following infographic. Read through them and consider how you might make a few changes to help businesses save the world as well as their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A discussion on HVAC coil coatings and corrosion</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many HVAC manufacturers, distributors and contractors may not realize that hundreds of thousands of coil failures have occurred during the last decade from corrosion. The cause is most typically environmental pollutants, which range anywhere from salt-air, to household cleaning agents, pesticides, formaldehydes, building materials, and even off-gassing of food. Each of these contaminant sources can initiate corrosion in coil tubing in a year or less when the conditions are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, refrigeration coils were continually failing in a South American fruit processing plant&amp;rsquo;s banana room that used fruit-ripening ethylene gas generators. Gaseous by-products from the catalytic generator combined with the moisture in the ripening area formed a weak acid that resulted in pinhole leaks in the coil tubing after a year or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Aside from fruit processing plants, most coastal area HVAC equipment &amp;ndash; whether it&amp;rsquo;s commercial or residential &amp;ndash; is also bombarded with corrosion from ocean salt.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Common Types of Coil Corrosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The two most common forms of coil corrosion are pitting and formicary. These two corrosive processes can occur in as little as a few weeks after installation. More typically, corrosion will begin appearing within a one- to four-year period. The ability to distinguish pitting from formicary corrosion might help detect and eliminate the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pitting corrosion is typically caused by the presence of chlorides or fluorides. Chlorides are found in numerous items such as snow-melting crystals, toilet bowl/tile cleaners, dishwasher detergents, fabric softeners, vinyl fabrics, carpeting, paint strippers, etc. Fluorides are used in many municipal water treatment plants. Unlike formicary corrosion, pitting is usually visible on the exterior of the copper tube with the naked eye. Pitting is caused by an aggressive attack of negatively-charged chloride/fluoride ions carried to the metal surface by condensate. The negative ions attack the oxide film the metal usually uses to protect itself, essentially forming a corrosion driven battery that consumes the copper. After pits have formed in the copper, they will progress through the thickness of the copper tube until a pinhole is formed causing the coil to leak refrigerant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Formicary corrosion is caused by organic acids such as acetic and formic acids. Acetic acids are abundant in numerous household products such as adhesives, paneling, particle board, silicone caulking, cleaning solvents, vinegar, foam insulation and dozens of other commonly found products in the home or commercial/industrial workplace. Formic acid can be found in cosmetics, disinfectants, tobacco and wood smoke, latex paints, plywood, and dozens of other materials. The corrosion caused by these substances is usually not visible to the naked eye, although black or blue-gray deposits can sometimes be seen on the surface. Formicary corrosion can form a sub-surface network of microscopic corroded tunnels within the tubing wall resembling ant nest-type structures that are substantially larger than the surface pinholes above them. Eventually one or more of these tunnels will progress to the surface of the copper and form a pinhole which quickly results in coil leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the Right Coating For the Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The first step a contractor must take when confronted with coil corrosion is to determine if it will happen repeatedly when coils are replaced. It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult diagnosis to determine if the coil corrosion is a one-time phenomenon or a continuing problem in that particular location. In the case of the banana processing plant or a coastal area unit, coils most likely will continually corrode, and their replacement units should have a protective coating. In less corrosive environments, owners should attempt to eliminate in-home corrosive elements such as cleaning solvents from the return airstream by storing them in areas that are not near a return duct. These actions might eliminate the expense and need to coat a replacement unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Choosing the most appropriate coil coating for the application could save the project thousands of dollars and eliminate repeat treatments. Choosing the wrong coil coating could reduce heat transfer capabilities and lead to higher energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Heat transfer is a major issue to consider when coating a coil with any substance, especially in a retrofit application because the coil may no longer perform at its manufactured specification. The thinner the coating, the better the heat transfer, while thick coatings can lead to significantly diminished heat transfer. Another issue is a coating&amp;rsquo;s hydrophobicity, or how well it drains condensation off the coil, to create optimum heat transfer capabilities. Ideally, water would drain quickly off of the coil to avoid reductions in efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Water accumulation is also detrimental because it can lead to the growth of mold and mildew. Most coatings do not actively resist biological growth, but their hydrophobicity can passively deter such growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Four basic coating types are prominent in the HVAC industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Polyurethanes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Epoxies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fluoropolymers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Silanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All four types of coatings offer differing degrees of advantages in terms of corrosion resistance, scratch resistance, flexibility, weight, thickness, hydrophobicity, and heat transfer capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Polyurethane (PU)&lt;/strong&gt;, invented in the 1940s, is used in a variety of applications. It can be manufactured as hard as fiberglass, bouncy as rubber, sticky as glue, and soft as upholstery foam. Many of the off-the-shelf PU-based coil coatings available to the HVAC trade can be applied in the field. PU formulations are fairly inexpensive, less viscous, more flexible, and thinner (typically 25 to 50 microns) than most coatings. The disadvantage is they are not as resilient or long-lasting as other coatings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Epoxy&lt;/strong&gt;, or phenolic-based, coatings are generally the cheapest of available coatings. Epoxies, developed in the late 1920s, are known for their excellent chemical and heat resistance, and are well known for coating floors and other surfaces. The high viscosity of epoxy-based systems leads to thicker coatings (approximately 50 to 100 microns) with poor flexibility and adherence characteristics. An epoxy coating is difficult to apply in the field. Therefore, the coil is typically disconnected and then shipped to a factory setting for a professional treatment. Because they are thicker, epoxy coatings will reduce heat transfer from the air to the refrigerant in the coil, and thus cause a decrease in system efficiency and capacity. Epoxy coatings might best suit new installations where heat transfer losses are accounted for in the system design specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Fluoropolymers&lt;/strong&gt;, first developed in 1938 by DuPont under the trade name Teflon, are now available in many different forms under a variety of trade names. Fluoropolymers are known for their high resistance to acids, solvents and bases. They are most effectively applied to metal through electrostatic powder coating or a thermal sintering process, as is done during the manufacturing of cookware and other non-stick products. Additionally, many field-use fluoropolymer sprays are available to contractors. The field-use sprays generally have very poor adhesion and their effectiveness will diminish significantly in a very short period of time. The cost of fluoropolymer-based field-use coatings is typically less than the more advanced epoxy and PU based coating system but their lifetime and effectiveness is very limited. Fluoropolymer coatings applied in the correct manner, through thermal sintering or electro-static powder coating, have not gained traction in the HVAC industry due to the expense of such processes and their inability to be performed in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Silanes&lt;/strong&gt; are well known as excellent coupling agents where two dissimilar materials such as paint (an organic) and glass (an inorganic material) can be bonded together. A variety of silane chemistries are available, many of which are tailored to have particular characteristics such as flexibility, hydrophobicity, and scratch resistance. Thus, the proper formulation of a silane coating can provide a flexible, resilient glass-like coating with good corrosion resistance and water draining capability that bonds extremely well to aluminum and copper (an inorganic). Silanes form an extremely thin coating when cured (less than 10 microns) that has very little, if any, adverse effects on heat transfer. They are very resilient against cracking and corrosion, are hydrophobic, and reduce airflow friction. Silanes can be quite difficult to apply properly in the field unless a trained applicator is hired to do so. The coil surfaces must be cleaned thoroughly and prepared properly for a successful application and therefore, it is best if the coating is applied at an off-site application center. Although silane coatings are typically somewhat more expensive that the other coatings described, they also exhibit the best heat transfer properties and typically have a much greater lifetime as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To conclude, our research indicates that a silane-based coating provides the best protection from the environment, and has minimal impact on heat transfer while remaining a long-lasting barrier that protects a HVAC coil against corrosion for an extended period of time (typically five years or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each of the coating technologies described carry different levels of toxicity. Service technicians planning to apply any of these coatings in the field should be outfitted with proper OSHA equipment and the appropriate breathing apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Report shows HVAC control market ripe for innovation</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;The heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) market, like nearly all other markets, has been significantly impacted by the economic turmoil that materialized in 2008 and accelerated through the first half of 2009. The HVAC market enjoyed a strong 2007 and early in 2008 the market looked like it was going to enjoy another strong year, but the collapse of the United States&amp;nbsp;housing market and subsequent chain reaction of events made for a very difficult business climate for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;The HVAC controls industry is in the middle of a very interesting transition. The market seems to be mature and stable â the seven largest suppliers account for more than four-fifths of all sales. âHowever, fundamental changes taking place in the market, such as the need for enterprise visibility, integration of HVAC systems with other building automation systems, increasing use of analytics in HVAC control, energy management initiatives, and the impact of Web-enabled systems and cloud computing make this dynamic market ripe for innovation,â according to ARC research analyst Joseph Gillespie (&lt;A href="mailto:jgillespie@arcweb.com"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;jgillespie@arcweb.com&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;), the principal author of ARCâs âHVAC Control Systems Worldwide Outlookâ (&lt;A href="http://www.arcweb.com/res/hvac"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;www.arcweb.com/res/hvac&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;). &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Increased Focus on Building Lifecycle Costs &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;One aspect of HVAC control systems that was not always considered in the past is that energy efficiency, lower environmental impact, and improved employee productivity all add up to a lower total cost of ownership and more attractive bottom line. However, this oversight is quickly dissipating and as building owners and engineers plan new projects or prepare for renovations, they are considering more than just the cost of buying, installing, and commissioning individual elements. Intelligent control systems can monitor and optimize energy consumption, quickly send out alarms and notifications that can prevent downtime, provide reports of systems that may be in override mode, and record historical data to monitor trends in energy consumption. Systems that are geared towards lowering the total cost of ownership over the entire lifecycle of the building and have the ability to tie this information into the enterprise level will experience the strongest growth over the forecast period.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;The adoption of Internet communication standards and Web Services in the HVAC controls market is extending the concept of smart buildings by including intelligent analysis of building data. In sharp contrast to traditional HVAC solutions, the new requirements for HVAC solutions include providing facilities managers the tools to perform the same sophisticated business intelligence analysis typically reserved for enterprise applications. Recognizing the emerging need for increasing business intelligence, more HVAC controls suppliers are focusing on providing these capabilities. The goal is to develop intelligent HVAC solutions capable of providing facilities managers the ability to base operational decisions on real-time performance data, uncover hidden costs, and find opportunities to reduce energy consumption and save money through comprehensive facilities management.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

There have been several major pieces of legislation in the US within the past five years that provide framework and financial incentives via increased tax deductions, loans, and grants to increase energy efficiency in buildings. At a time when the primary factor inhibiting growth in nearly all markets is the availability of capital and heightened opportunity costs for capital investments, new and increased incentives provided by the government to spur investments in building efficiency may be enough of a âshot in the armâ to counteract the substantial headwinds facing the overall economy and lead to healthy growth in the HVAC market beyond 2009.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Energy savings make the case for an HVAC upgrade</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;It was a familiar challenge for Mike Klingler, service manager for Farber Corporation, an HVAC/R contractor in Columbus, Ohio: Prove to a customer that investment in a major HVAC system upgrade would pay for itself in energy savings, without compromising occupant comfort or indoor air quality (IAQ).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âI work in all kinds of buildings,â says Klingler, âand I am often asked to reduce the energy costs of the HVAC systems.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The subject this time was an older six-story building that once housed an insurance company, but now serves students at a Columbus-area law school.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Working on a project to replace two outdoor cooling towers and install variable-frequency drives in the buildingâs HVAC system, Klingler noticed that one of the facilityâs two big 200-ton capacity chillers was kept running to supply cold water for the system, even in winter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âA lot of buildings we can cool with outside air,â Klingler says. âWhen we get down to 50 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit and below, we can just draw that outside air in and use it for free cooling. But because of the setup of the law school building, they had to run one of the chillers even when it was 20 to 25 degrees F outside. Because of the duct distribution system, we couldnât rely on outside air in certain areas of the building.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a result, one chiller kept running to supply water chilled to 45 F to the air handling units and keep the buildingâs occupied spaces comfortable. The big motors powering the device were consuming a lot of energy and money â power and cost the school could save if Klingler could find a better way to cool. Of course the solution would have to deliver acceptable indoor air quality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Klingler had a plan in mind, but didnât want to guess how much energy the big chiller was consuming. The return on investment (ROI) for his system optimization program would hinge on energy savings. The law building uses hot water heating and chilled water cooling, with a dual-duct system for air distribution. Hot and cold air travel to terminal units (also called mixing boxes) which mix flows to the required supply temperature.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Water chilled to 45 F is pumped to the air handler, where it cools supply air. In the process, excess building heat is transferred to the water, warming it to about 55 F. That warmer water then returns to the chiller, where it is cooled back down to 45 F and pumped back through the loop.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the original configuration, the chiller used the refrigeration cycle to transfer the waste heat to another water loop on the condenser side. Condenser water at about 85 F was then pumped through rooftop cooling towers that rejected the heat into the outside air.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Taking the guesswork out&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;âWhat if I figure another way to cool the system?â Klingler asked himself. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There was plenty of cold air available outside during the Columbus winter, where temperatures average 33.5 F in December, 28.3 F in January, 32 F in February and 42 F in March. Klingler figured he could bypass the chiller entirely. We can use the water from the cooling towers on the roof, he reasoned, to cool the chilled water. Instead of running the chiller, why not use the cooling towers to cool the condenser side water down to 45 F, and simply pump it through a plate and frame heat exchanger to extract waste heat from the chilled water loop? Instead of the chillerâs powerful compressor motors, the system would run with just a small pump. The cost of the upgrade would be significant, but Klingler felt he could prove it financially with accurate data on the potential energy savings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finding the ideal balance between building energy consumption and indoor air quality requires a careful balance of multiple factors. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOne of the areas we look to are ventilation rates for the building,â Klingler said. âDecreasing ventilation rates may reduce overall energy consumption and reduce operating costs, but at the same time, we have to maintain good indoor air quality standard, too. Thereâs usually a very tight ventilation standard that the service provider has to control in order to reduce energy costs and maintain quality indoor air conditions. Considering the dynamic changes in a building and a functioning HVAC system, in many cases, itâs not real easy.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But Klingler was well equipped to find the balance point. He could measure multiple IAQ factors before the upgrade, then check afterward to ensure air quality was not compromised, using the Fluke 975 AirMeter test tool. And, he didnât have to estimate energy consumption, or guess. He logged actual kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumption at the chiller over multiple 12-hour cycles, using a beta test version of the new Fluke 1735 Power Logger.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIâm saying OK, I have to run that 100-horsepower motor in the winter time,â Klingler said. âWhatâs the real kWh? Then I can go back to the owner and say, hereâs how much is it costing us to run that chiller. The Fluke 1735 will measure and monitor over time and tell me the real power consumption of that equipment. It takes the guesswork out of it. Before having the power analyzer, you would have to say well, itâs probably consuming about this much power. But you can set this tool up and walk away, then come back and get the information. You can see what your real power consumption is for any equipment in your building, and then equate that to real dollars.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Proving in the payback&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Klinglerâs measurements with the Fluke 1735 showed that the big chiller averaged 790 kWh of power consumption over a 12-hour period. He computed a total power consumption over the four cold-weather months of 189,600 kWh. At a cost of six cents per kWh, running that chiller was costing the law school $11,376 every winter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Klingler figured his alternate approach would cut that bill by 87.5 percent, for an annual energy saving of $9,954. He estimated that installing the heat exchanger, piping, valves and controls would cost $46,000. That meant the payback period for the project would be just 4.62 years. And, that estimate did not include possible savings due to reduced wear and tear on the chiller unit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While heâs waiting for a response on his proposal for a system upgrade, Klingler has found lots of other uses for the Fluke 1735 and the 975 AirMeter. Beyond simply measuring power consumption, the Fluke Power Logger collects all kinds of power quality information that Klingler figures will help him do his job. And the AirMeter makes it a snap to calculate percentage of outside air required to meet standards. Working on a one-floor remodel in a 10-story office building, Klingler had to calculate the percentage of outside air delivered to a newly laid-out conference room. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe go to ASHRAE 62 and the local building code, and they say 15 percent of the air delivered to the space needs to be outside air,â he said. âHow do you know that 15 percent is really outside air? You have to go back to the big air handler, take a reading and say, howâs this air handler set up right now? Whatâs the percentage of outside air weâre providing to the entire building? With the 975 AirMeter, the service company can go right into the air handler and take those readings and it will tell us, based on temperature or carbon dioxide. Itâs a very quick, easy, labor-saving tool.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On the power quality side, the Power Logger measures voltage on three phases and current on three phases and neutral. It records multiple parameters that can help determine system load, including voltage, current, frequency, real power (kilowatts, kW), apparent power (kVA), reactive power (kVAR), power factor, and energy (kWh). It can also perform power quality measurements. And, the Fluke 1735 downloads to a PC and comes with software for creating reports.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A more savvy contractor&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;âThe power logger makes it real easy for the contractor or engineering group to come in and measure power consumption on individual components in a building, a plant or an industrial facility,â Klingler said. âWhen you start to look at the individual components, it allows you to think in terms of control strategies: How can I control this piece of equipment to reduce energy consumption? How much is it costing me, and what can I do for savings?â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Beyond such applications, Klingler sees the Fluke 1735 as a tool that can help him move his business to a higher level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFor a mechanical contractor such as myself, youâre adding service offerings through the use of this product,â he said. âIt allows you to be a more savvy contractor. It allows you to be more advanced and offer the additional services that I think we should be providing to our customers. You can export the data to spreadsheets, which you can use for presentations to the building owners. Thatâs a big feature when I sit down at the table.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to measuring power consumption, as Klingler did at the law school, the Fluke 1735 measures and logs voltage, amps, frequencies, waveforms, harmonics and power anomalies. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFor maintenance and servicing, itâs a troubleshooting tool,â Klingler said. âYou can see if youâre having a problem with power, or when youâre not sure whatâs happening and you canât see it with a snapshot from your meter. You can measure it, record it and view it with this device. As a contractor, I would use it as a diagnostic tool, and it would be just as valuable to me in that regard as it is as a power consumption tool. I can use it both ways.â&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>State-of-the-art HVAC system for Shanghai auto factory </title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;During the design phase of a new automobile manufacturing factory in Shanghai, China, ITTâs Bell &amp;amp; Gossett unit was called in to resolve problems with the siteâs heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The result was an advanced and efficient set of pump sensors and controllers that power the large industrial facilityâs HVAC system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shanghai General Motors Company Ltd. (SGM) is a 50-50 joint venture with U.S. auto giant General Motors and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation Group (SAIC), the leading passenger car manufacturer in China. The largest automotive joint venture in China, Shanghai GM was formed in June 1997. It manufactures a family of Buick products, as well as engines and transmissions. Shanghai GM is fully supported by a network of sales, aftersales and parts centers. Shanghai GM has an annual production capacity of 200,000 vehicles operating on three shifts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With sales success came the expansion of production facilities in Shanghai. SGMâs latest expansion is the South Plant. Covering 230,000 square meters, the plant is equipped with the most advanced automobile production line and equipment. Five main workshops adopt the management process of modularized design and flexible production lines to satisfy the variable requirements of the market by producing several different model cars in a single production line. The new SGM factory produces luxury Cadillac model cars. The output of the new SGM factory is predicted to reach 200,000 cars per year.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the first phase of the factory construction, the HVAC system was equipped with pumps and common variable-speed controls. After tests during the design period, the HVAC equipment supplier was not able to resolve a number of unsatisfactory phenomena and performance problems. In order to resolve these system problems, the plantâs master designer began a process of engaging HVAC experts and investigating alternatives.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Educating HVAC Professionals&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In China, ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett is viewed as a manufacturer, and as an educator and expert in HVAC equipment and system analysis. Every year, an instructor from Bell &amp;amp; Gossett holds seminars and advanced lecture series around China for HVAC designers and ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett distributors. This education is built on the 50-year history of the âLittle Red Schoolhouseâ, a center for HVAC education that ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett runs from its headquarters near Chicago. The master HVAC system designer in charge of the SGM project was invited to attend the ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett seminar held in Nanjing. The principles, formulations and systems analysis shown in the seminar ultimately satisfied the master designer that ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett could resolve the HVAC system problems at the auto plant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After the seminar, discussion began with SGM regarding the new factoryâs HVAC system. Piping layout drawings and system drawings were analyzed and ideas were shared to solve the HVAC design problems. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Variable-Speed Drives Save Energy&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Powering the huge HVAC system in the auto factory is the power plant, which takes up 5,000 square meters. This plant includes seven 2,000-ton chillers and three 400-ton chillers. Tying these chillers into the plantâs HVAC system are ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossettâs primary and secondary systems with variable-speed design. Integrated into the new factoryâs HVAC system is a large contingent of ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett pump systems, including nine large ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett Series VSCS pumps, 14 Series HSCS horizontally split pumps and 14 Series 1510 base-mounted end-suction pumps. The pumps are controlled by the primary and secondary variable-speed system and provide the factory with excellent energy savings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pressure sensors were placed in a number of positions throughout the plant; these sensors pass a signal to controllers. The controllers then change the frequency of the variable-speed drive to the pumpâs rotation speed control, allowing an accurate flow in the HVAC system. In a comparison to the variable transmission that many cars are now equipped with, the ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett systems can provide the factoryâs HVAC system with any capacity of flow by changing the pumpsâ rotation speed. The initial cost of the variable-speed controller equipment is offset within short running period by minimizing energy expense.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A local team including Fluidtech, the ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett distributor in Shanghai, and Alex Jiang, the ITT Bell &amp;amp; Gossett sales manager in Shanghai, assisted the SGM design engineers and successfully finished the HVAC primary-secondary variable-speed system design for the plant. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information, visit &lt;A href="http://www.bellgossett.com/"&gt;www.bellgossett.com&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/HVAC/~4/FbNAxH9gpxA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ANSI standards span HVAC, document management</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In an effort to communicate the vital role that standards play in daily life, the American National Standards Institute publishes, on an ongoing basis, a series of snapshots of the diverse standards initiatives undertaken in the global and national standards arena, many of which are performed by ANSI members and ANSI-accredited standards developers. Two of the latest selections follow: &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Topping many springtime âto-doâ lists is the annual test run of air conditioners to determine whether a unit needs to be upgraded or replaced. This year, a new American national standard lends a helping hand, outlining national requirements for the quality installation (QI) of residential and commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

The standard spells out consensus requirements for quality installations, procedures for measuring or verifying conformity with those requirements, and acceptable forms of documentation to demonstrate compliance. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Written to meet the needs of contractors, equipment manufacturers, HVAC trainers and building owners, the standard defines steps to ensure that HVAC equipment is properly sized, selected, and installed for residential and commercial applications.
