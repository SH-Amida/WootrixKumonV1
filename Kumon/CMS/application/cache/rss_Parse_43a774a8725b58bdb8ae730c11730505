			<description>Among older men with heart attack, heart failure or pneumonia, hospitalization at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, compared with hospitalization at non-VA hospitals, was associated with lower 30-day all-cause mortality rates for heart attack and heart failure, and higher 30-day all-cause readmission rates for all three conditions, both nationally and within similar geographic areas, although absolute differences between these outcomes were small, according to a study.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/O8cCLXUm7_Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Infectious diseases cause significant emergency visits, hospitalizations for older adults</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/p7j8wMzp8LQ/160201141728.htm</link>
			<description>In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers calculated that infectious diseases account for 13.5 percent of emergency room (ER) visits involving older adults -- a higher percentage than ER visits for heart attacks and congestive heart failure combined. Infectious diseases are those that can be passed from person-to-person and caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/p7j8wMzp8LQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Studying 'inflamm-aging': Monocytes, cytokines, and susceptibility to pneumonia</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/PfxK2qW339w/160114152306.htm</link>
			<description>The chronic state of low-level inflammation seen in many elderly individuals (sometimes called 'inflamm-aging'), is associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, as well as susceptibility to infections, especially pneumonia. A new study reveals a crucial role of monocytes in the immune system changes that occur with age, and may help explain why older people are more susceptible to pneumonia.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/PfxK2qW339w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/-rALE1xpsr8/151124112144.htm</link>
			<description>An exciting advance provides hope for developing novel potential method of treating pneumococcal diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia. A team of researchers uses a technique called X-ray crystallography to see the individual atoms of the toxin. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than 1.6 million people every year die from pneumococcal infections, including more than 800,000 children under 5 years old.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/-rALE1xpsr8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Early childhood bronchiolitis increases asthma risk in adulthood</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/o67qQowD6rU/151123103330.htm</link>
			<description>People who have had bronchiolitis in early childhood have an increased risk of asthma at the age of 28-31 and a weaker health-related quality of life than their peers. In lung function tests, they also demonstrate changes indicative of irreversible airway obstruction, according to a new study. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia are common lower respiratory tract infections in early childhood. During their first year, around 30 per cent of children have bronchiolitis, leading to hospitalization in 1 to 3 per cent.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/o67qQowD6rU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; is both a transient skin colonizer and a formidable human pathogen, ranking amongst the leading causes of skin and soft tissue infections, as well as severe pneumonia. Scientists attempt to work out new strategies to fight against this pathogen, of which numerous strains are now resistant to antibiotic treatments.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/urcE62rpjig" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>When paired with coinfection, social isolation might fuel rather than foil epidemics</title>

			<description>When social isolation and coinfection occur together, diseases can spread faster and further than with either effect alone, new research shows. At the heart of the new study are two effects that have gained a lot of attention in recent years -- social clustering and coinfection -- but haven't been studied together. That, the authors say, turns out to be a major omission.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/2BUZDJ8BkjU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Links between household air pollution, lung infections examined, including pneumonia</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/5ve9pslBWr4/150508082627.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have come a step closer to understanding why people exposed to household air pollution (HAP) are at higher risk of lung infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Three billion people worldwide are exposed to HAP from the fuels they burn to cook, light and heat with at home. Frequently, charcoal, wood and food waste are burned and generate high concentrations of smoke particles. This exposure is associated with increased risk of pneumonia, particularly in low and middle income countries where bacterial pneumonia is the biggest cause of infant mortality. This risk is well known, but the reasons are not.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/5ve9pslBWr4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Older adults often are readmitted after hospitalization for heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction, a significant issue that has caused Medicare to target hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates for financial penalties. Older adults are also often admitted for reasons other than the original hospitalization. This vulnerability to readmission has been referred to as 'post-hospital syndrome.' However, whether younger patients also experience a similar pattern of readmission has not been well studied.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/O5Oechhljo4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>How pneumonia bacteria can compromise heart health</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/Azv44QwX4c8/140918141441.htm</link>
			<description>Bacterial pneumonia in adults carries an elevated risk for adverse cardiac events (such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart attacks) that contribute substantially to mortality -- but how the heart is compromised has been unclear. A study now demonstrates that Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium responsible for most cases of bacterial pneumonia, can invade the heart and cause the death of heart muscle cells.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/Azv44QwX4c8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Previous pulmonary disease linked to increased lung cancer risk in large study</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/XB_us_Fw_fY/140815102035.htm</link>
			<description>Links between a number of common respiratory diseases and an increased risk of developing lung cancer have been found in a large pooled analysis of seven studies involving more than 25,000 individuals. "The variations in the associations between lung cancer and different patterns of previous respiratory diseases that we observed in our study may indicate differences in the underlying etiological mechanisms," said the lead author. "Better understanding of these associations may help guide the type and frequency of clinical surveillance needed for patients with each of these diseases."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/XB_us_Fw_fY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Prognosis of pneumonia: value of respiratory rate often overlooked</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/oSdyMU3qmF8/140812121845.htm</link>
			<description>Pneumonia â a severe lung infection â is the most common disease calling for hospital admission. More than one out of ten pneumonia patients die of the disease. Thus it is vital to accurately predict and closely monitor the clinical course. Here, measuring the respiratory rate â the number of breaths a person takes in a minute â provides valuable information. However, far too little use is still being made of this vital sign in clinical practice, researchers conclude.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/oSdyMU3qmF8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The bodyâs assailants are cleverer than previously thought. New research shows for the first time how bacteria in the airways can help each other replenish vital iron. The bacteria thereby increase their chances of survival, which can happen at the expense of the personâs health.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/VnVgomUskgQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Drugs used to treat lung disease work with body clock</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/gKT-kqRkVWc/140727165641.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have discovered why medication to treat asthma and pneumonia can become ineffective. The findings show that drugs widely used to treat lung diseases work with the body clock. The research found out that cells lining the lung airways have their own body clock which is the time-keeper for lung inflammation - both conditions cause swelling (inflammation) in the lungs.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/gKT-kqRkVWc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A postoperative pneumonia prevention program for patients in the surgical ward at a California Veterans Affairs hospital lowered the case rate for the condition, which can cause significant complications and increase the cost of care. Pneumonia is a common infection that accounts for about 15 percent of all hospital-acquired infections and as much as 3.4 percent of complications among surgical patients.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/0FZ_onqLFwY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Bacterial colonization prior to catching flu may protect against severe illness</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/VzE2WiObF-0/140710131047.htm</link>
			<description>Severe illness and even death are likely to result if you develop another respiratory infection after catching the flu. Now, however, a team of researchers has determined that if you reverse the order of infection, pneumococcus bacteria may actually protect against a bad case of the flu. The bacterial protein pneumolysin, a bacterial virulence factor, might protect certain immune system cells (macrophages) in the alveoli of the lungs, preventing inflammation and, thus, pneumonia.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/VzE2WiObF-0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Mechanism that prevents lethal bacteria from causing invasive disease is revealed</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~3/U5_O4uiz1yY/140707134356.htm</link>
			<description>An important development in understanding how the bacterium that causes pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia remains harmlessly in the nose and throat has been discovered by scientists. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a 'commensal', which can live harmlessly in the nasopharynx as part of the body's natural bacterial flora. However, in the very young and old it can invade the rest of the body, leading to serious diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis, which claim up to a million lives every year worldwide.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/U5_O4uiz1yY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Treatment for pneumonia that included azithromycin compared with other antibiotics was associated with a significantly lower risk of death and a slightly increased risk of heart attack, according to a study that included nearly 65,000 hospitalized older patients. Pneumonia and influenza together are the eighth leading cause of death and the leading causes of infectious death in the United States.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/UMi4qteRfWY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Differences in the genetic code of pneumococcal bacteria have been identified by researcher that may explain why it poses such a risk to children with sickle cell disease and why current vaccines donât provide better protection against the infection. The findings will aid efforts to improve vaccine effectiveness and inform research into new ways to protect young sickle cell disease patients from life-threatening pneumococcal infections that can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, bloodstream infections and other problems.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/eDs_gl1nu-o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Bacteria donât have sex as such, but they can mix their genetic material by pulling in DNA from dead bacterial cells and inserting these into their own genome. New research has found that this process -- called recombination -- is more complex than was first thought. The findings could help us understand why bacteria which cause serious diseases are able to evade vaccines and rapidly become drug-resistant.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/pneumonia/~4/GBa53u4gndM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
