			<description>In people suffering from cystic fibrosis the CFTR protein is not located in the right place in mucus-producing cells: it remains inside the cell while it should be in the cell wall. Those cells secrete a tough mucus with serious consequences. However, researchers have now succeeded in conducting the CFTR to the cell walls.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/89bR1YwgWkc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A new study provides an answer for a long-standing scientific puzzle: why don't mice with CF gene mutations develop the life-threatening lung disease that affects most people with CF? The answer to the puzzle identifies a proton pump called ATP12A as a potential target for new CF therapies.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/gJeL22EkN6s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A powerful new machine-learning technique can be applied to large datasets in the biological sciences to uncover previously unknown features of organisms and their genes. For example, the technique learned the characteristic gene-expression patterns that appear when a bacterial pathogen is exposed to low-oxygen conditions and robustly identified changes that occur in response to antibiotics.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/Rf9QUjalvZk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Why do some infections persist? Blame bacterial socialism</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~3/2ppOdxoYOxE/160113100841.htm</link>
			<description>New research uses time lapse microscopy to show that bacteria use a hedging strategy to trade off varying degrees of antibiotic resistance even when they are not under threat. This new insight could explain why some infections persist in spite of antibiotic treatment and suggests that a different dosing strategy that would wait out trading off strategy could be effective.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/2ppOdxoYOxE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>New research findings add further clarity to a question that has polarized the cystic fibrosis (CF) research community. It is well established that people with cystic fibrosis have two faulty copies of the CFTR gene, but debate continues on the question of whether certain symptoms of the airway disease are caused by the mutation or if the genetic defect precedes, but does not directly lead to some of the worst symptoms patients face.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/mKgW45OJMYY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Ethnic differences in cystic fibrosis genetic coding not addressed in screening tests for nonwhite patients</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~3/NolTu79TGqM/151216081929.htm</link>
			<description>Cystic fibrosis (CF) occurs less frequently in nonwhites than in whites, and nonwhites tend to be diagnosed at a later age. Delaying diagnosis can result in postponed treatment and clinical deterioration. A new study has found that one reason for this ethnic disparity in CF diagnoses is that the variants examined in the most common CF newborn screening panels do not sufficiently include the variants present in nonwhite populations.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/NolTu79TGqM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Researchers have been studying mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, and their primary goal was to design inhalable therapeutic nanoparticles that cross the cystic fibrosis mucus barrier in the lung. But the work recently led the researchers to the unexpected discovery that mucus appears to change as the disease progresses; the mobility of these nanoparticles could vary widely in mucus from different patients.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/ptFGIUiOtGc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>If you have two faulty copies of the CFTR gene, you will have cystic fibrosis. But the severity of your disease will depend partly on many other genes. Now, researchers report that five regions of the human genome are home to the genetic variations that play major roles in disease severity.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/Geg7lCavk-E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) have added years to the lives of thousands of Americans. But they can be difficult to administer, and most don't fix the underlying cause. Scientists have now found that a small molecule, when tested in yeast, can substitute for a protein and restore a key cellular function related to those missing in people with CF and similar conditions.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/t42oEug5zyM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Treatments for the same opportunistic bacteria found in cystic fibrosis patients can work in one area in the lung and be less effective in others. The reason, researchers report, is that bacteria become isolated from one another and evolve region-specific traits. Researchers saw differences in bacterial nutritional requirements, host defenses, and antibiotic resistance. The findings suggest that other chronic infections may yield similar bacterial diversity.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/N1DdSRsrD8k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. A defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and leads to life-threatening lung infections, obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/Ogl9-MaeVUI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A new method of testing the most common cause of life-threatening infection in people with cystic fibrosis could improve efforts to study and combat the illness, researchers say. In cystic fibrosis, a serious genetic disease that causes recurring lung infections, bacteria colonize a patient's lungs, usually beginning in childhood, leading to difficulty breathing. One of the most dangerous of these bacteria is P. aeruginosa, which, within the unique mucus that forms in the lungs of a person with cystic fibrosis, develops into large, antibiotic-resistant colonies.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/PZM_jb0OYCI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Preventing lung infections in childhood could stop later life-threatening infections for people with cystic fibrosis (CF), according to recent research. Scientists are investigating how bacteria found in children with CF can disarm their natural defence mechanisms, making it easier for more virulent bacteria to infect their airways. By the time many CF patients reach adulthood, they have already contracted the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strain, which can cause extensive and eventually fatal damage to the lungs. The infection is currently extremely difficult to treat effectively.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/NSlNfAfb0Fk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Potential targets for therapy for some adolescents with cystic fibrosis who develop advanced liver disease have been found by researchers. They found that those with liver disease had a different microbiome (gut bacteria), slower small bowel motility and more signs of small bowel inflammation compared to those without liver disease. This suggests that there is an interaction between the gut bacteria in cystic fibrosis and the liver that may lead to liver disease.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/PxHj0R18BbA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Following lung transplantation, resistance to the anti-viral drug ganciclovir may be more likely in cystic fibrosis patients, scientists report. Ganciclovir is given to lung transplant patients to protect against a life-threatening virus that is common after transplantation, and reduces mortality due to the virus from 34 percent to between 3 and 6 percent. But between 5 percent and 10 percent of patients infected with the virus have strains that are resistant to the drug.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/J8EtnVuPk3o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Canadians with cystic fibrosis are living almost 20 years longer than they did two decades ago, according to a new research paper. In addition, the median age at which Canadians with cystic fibrosis die has risen to 32 years in 2012 from 21.7 years in 1990. The death rate declined from 1.4 deaths per year in 1990 to 0.99 deaths per year in 2012, authors report.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/w7Sa__G5DiE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~3/ocPApAvbhNM/141014152538.htm</link>
			<description>By screening over 2,000 approved drugs and natural products, scientists have shown that tannic acid may help ease the impact of bacterial lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Tests completed using experimentally modified frog oocytes show that tannic acid counteracts the harmful effect of an enzyme produced by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). However, more research is needed to find out if tannic acid can help treat S. aureus infections in humans.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/ocPApAvbhNM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A potential new treatment that reverses the effects of pulmonary fibrosis, a respiratory disease in which scars develop in the lungs and severely hamper breathing, is being studied by scientists. The treatment uses a microRNA mimic, miR-29, which is delivered to lung tissue intravenously. In mouse models, miR-29 not only blocked pulmonary fibrosis, it reversed fibrosis after several days.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/C1kMHNJposQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Mucus is key to keeping our lungs clean and clear of bacteria, viruses, and other foreign particles that can cause infection and inflammation. When we inhale microbes and dust, they are trapped in the mucus and then swept up and out of the lungs via a process called mucociliary transport. New research shows that cystic fibrosis causes a specific defect in this process, reducing the ability to clear particles and germs out of the airway.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/SWUpCdOe1s8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Increased mucins pinned to worsening cystic fibrosis symptoms</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~3/WHmS8FARhKA/140602204446.htm</link>
			<description>The first quantitative evidence that mucins â the protein framework of mucus â are significantly increased in cystic fibrosis patients, and play a major role in failing lung function, has been presented by researchers. The research shows that a three-fold increase of mucins dramatically increases the water-draining power of the mucus layer. This hinders mucus clearance in the CF lung, resulting in infection, inflammation, and ultimately lung failure.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/WHmS8FARhKA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Many people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes. The reasons for this have been largely unknown, but now researchers have identified a molecular mechanism that contributes to the raised diabetes risk. Cystic fibrosis is the result of a genetic mutation in an ion channel that normally regulates salt transport in cells, primarily in the lungs and pancreas.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/4yPAT6HnOxc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Boosting Immune process with IFN-Î³ helps clear lethal bacteria in cystic fibrosis</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~3/4RVfG6mEjo0/140520133220.htm</link>
			<description>Boosting a key immune process called autophagy with interferon gamma -- IFN-Â³ -- could help clear a lethal bacterial infection in cystic fibrosis, a new study suggests. The work offers new information about immune function in patients with the disease. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a malfunction in the CFTR gene, which is responsible for transporting chloride and water across cell membranes. In people with the disease, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas and other organs produce unusually thick and sticky mucus that clogs the airways -- creating an ideal environment for pathogens.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cystic_fibrosis/~4/4RVfG6mEjo0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
