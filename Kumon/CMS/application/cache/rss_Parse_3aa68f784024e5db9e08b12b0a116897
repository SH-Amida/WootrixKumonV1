            <title>Noria Named Among Oklahoma's Top Workplaces</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/19/f43baad1-8e3b-4170-9bda-e5a5fe84b03c_Best-Places-to-Work-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 111px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Noria Corporation was recently named among the top workplaces of 2015 in a survey of Oklahoma companies conducted by &lt;em&gt;The Oklahoman&lt;/em&gt; and Philadelphia-based research firm WorkplaceDynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The Oklahoman&lt;/em&gt; and WorkplaceDynamics considered 1,210 companies employing at least 35 personnel within Oklahoma. Of those, they selected the best 70 candidates, with Noria ranking among the top 40 companies employing fewer than 125 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our research of employee feedback concludes the common thread is having a healthy organization,&amp;quot; wrote WorkplaceDynamics CEO Doug Claffey. &amp;quot;Healthy organizations thrive on people who feel connected to their workplace through meaningful work and the belief that their company is moving in the right direction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Criteria for the top workplaces were based on the results of employee surveys in which staff members from participating companies evaluated their workplaces on seven different factors: work, manager, pay and benefits, direction, execution, connection, and engagement. Across the board, Oklahoma employees&amp;#39; top priorities pertained to organizational health and connection, with pay and benefits scoring the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Employees among &lt;em&gt;The Oklahoman&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; top workplaces buy in to where they&amp;#39;re going and how they&amp;#39;re getting there,&amp;quot; Claffey noted. &amp;quot;So much so, they&amp;#39;re not afraid to use the &amp;#39;L-word&amp;#39; when it comes to their jobs &amp;ndash; &amp;#39;I love my job.&amp;#39; WorkplaceDynamics has determined for many years that more money or perks do not account for the difference between an average and poor workplace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Noria Corporation is the education resource of choice for numerous Fortune 500 companies. In addition to publishing and providing conferences and employee training, Noria provides a range of services related to advanced machine reliability and maintenance technologies. The majority of its editorial staff are practicing professionals who make up the leadership of Noria&amp;#39;s consulting and services team.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Will the Internet of Things Affect Your Business?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/14/39ab2a27-3493-4aa9-a3aa-e7a5aa4d8369_iot.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 222px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;What is the Internet of things (IoT)? It can be explained as the network of physical objects or things embedded with electronics, software, sensors and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. This includes anything with an on and off switch, such as your thermostat, light switches or water meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IoT could also be described as the relationship between people and people, people and things, and things and things. How does this impact you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The research firm Gartner predicts there will be more than 26 billion connected devices by 2020. The new rule for the future will soon become &amp;ldquo;anything that can be connected will be connected.&amp;rdquo; There are several examples of what this will look like in your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, imagine you are on your way to a morning meeting. Your car could access your calendar and already know the best route to take. If there is traffic, your phone could send a text message to the attendees in the meeting to let them know you may be a few minutes late. Or, you may want to adjust the temperature in your office building five to 10 degrees at the end of the day to save on energy costs. These are the types of things that are quickly becoming reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Economic Impact of the IoT on Businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By 2025, the IoT has a potential economic impact of $3.9 to $11.1 trillion per year. Sensors/modules and connectivity account for more than 50 percent of spending on the IoT, followed by information technology (IT) services and software. This economic value will be derived from revenue generated by device installations and sales as well as savings from efficiency gains. It is reported that 36 percent of companies in North America had IoT initiatives in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With sensors getting cheaper, more and more physical objects are becoming part of a network of things changing the way we live and work. The IoT is about connecting devices and acquiring data to create more visibility in machine performance, where a company is losing energy, where potential savings could be found and how these issues can be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	How Maintenance and the IoT Work Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integration of systems will be the difference between hundreds and thousands of dollars saved within a company. By integrating the IoT and preventive maintenance, you will be able to tell more quickly and accurately if one of your assets is faltering quicker than expected and determine what changes need to be made to avoid those problems from becoming disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IoT will be fundamental in improving productivity and efficiency in maintenance by adjusting environment controls and increasing cost savings. It can also help generate real-time data analysis, a greater adoption of predictive maintenance and recommended repair actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies that have started using IoT initiatives, such as smart metering, have shown that energy-monitoring technologies can help reduce energy consumption by 5-15 percent. The IoT can also be utilized to save time, manual labor and costs throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re tracking 16 meters manually with a labor cost of $16 per hour, checking the meters once per day will cost you $3,840. Now imagine checking the meters once per hour, per minute and per second. It becomes impossible to manually check your meters that often without the Internet of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Combined with an enterprise asset management (EAM)/computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), the IoT can allow your team to capture data, quickly see trends emerging with your assets and aggregate other information based on new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So is your company ready for the IoT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/VthiixA_jso" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Keys for Developing a Sustainable Reliability Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2016/1/7/53c5e02f-5c88-47e0-83c8-d53216a4c4e2_reliability-program.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 320px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Organizations often rush into implementing internal reliability programs and do not obtain the expected results. In some cases, these programs are eventually abandoned. This lack of success is due to not spending the time upfront to evaluate existing maintenance processes and developing a comprehensive reliability roadmap tailored for the company&amp;#39;s specific needs. The three main components of a reliability program &amp;mdash; processes, people and technology &amp;mdash; should all be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementing a good and sustainable 5-S program will improve the efficiencies of the maintenance team and promote a safer environment. Engaging operators to perform minor checks and inspections as well as training them to understand failure modes will increase equipment reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next step is to develop a root cause analysis (RCA) thought process and to train maintenance technicians to follow an easy-to-understand RCA process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the proper troubleshooting mindset is developed, you must implement a preventive maintenance (PM) optimization program and evaluate the effectiveness of existing PMs. The main question you should ask is, &amp;quot;Are my PMs generating follow-up work orders?&amp;quot; An effective PM program not only will generate follow-up work orders but also minimize or eliminate asset breakdowns between PMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For critical assets, a reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) program ensures that the PM program has tasks to mitigate failures, which are identified through the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) process. RCM also considers the most cost-effective way to increase the reliability of the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upgrading the skills of the maintenance team plays an important part in your reliability roadmap. The first step in developing the maintenance team should be to create a skills matrix showing a rating of the skills for each technician. This matrix will serve as the foundation for the technical training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interpersonal training can help maintenance technicians interact better with equipment operators and production personnel. Maintenance technicians need to be able to interview operators to understand the conditions that caused the failure. Once a repair is completed, the technician must ensure that the repaired asset is returned back to production and the operator is satisfied with the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tools and Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improving efficiencies by using mobile technology can free up maintenance personnel and allow them to focus on increasing asset reliability. Automating certain tasks and making RCA and RCM databases available to your maintenance teams will enable them to perform their tasks faster while employing best practices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/3bJCLgtYQlc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Boeing Agrees to Improve Maintenance Planning Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;#39;s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently announced a comprehensive settlement agreement with Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) that resolves multiple pending and potential enforcement cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the agreement, BCA pledged to implement and improve several certification processes to further enhance the airworthiness and continued compliance of all BCA products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Compliance requires all certificate holders to develop and implement internal controls that ensure they&amp;#39;re operating according to the highest standards,&amp;quot; said FAA administrator Michael Huerta. &amp;quot;Boeing has agreed to implement improvements in its design, planning, production and maintenance planning processes, and has already implemented several of these improvements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BCA&amp;#39;s obligations commit the company to meeting specific performance targets. They are designed to enhance BCA&amp;#39;s early discovery and self-disclosure of potential regulatory compliance problems, as well as the timely development and implementation of effective corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also must make an immediate payment to the U.S. Treasury in the amount of $12 million and faces stiff penalties for failing to follow through on its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BCA&amp;#39;s obligations include improved management oversight and accountability, internal auditing, enhanced supplier management, quality and timeliness regulatory submissions, specification simplification, stampings and other verification records accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	BCA will face up to $24 million in additional penalties over the next five years if it fails to implement its obligations under the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The performance period for BCA&amp;#39;s commitments begins Jan. 1, 2016, and will continue for five years unless the FAA and BCA agree to an extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The agreement settles two initiated cases and 11 other matters that were opened during the last several years. The first initiated case involved BCA&amp;#39;s tardiness in developing information for the installation of fuel tank flammability reduction equipment on Boeing 747 and 757 aircraft. The second initiated case involved the company&amp;#39;s insufficient corrective action after discovering that a supplier had been providing incorrectly shaped fasteners. The FAA did not allege that these issues created unsafe conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The uninitiated matters involved allegations of delays in submitting required safety information, production quality control problems and failures to implement corrective actions for those production problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Should You Measure Maintenance Costs?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/12/16/646530d6-1187-45d2-8db5-27f5c52a20f5_measure-reliability.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 215px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Maintenance is a cost of doing business and is required to be reported as such in your financial statements. In manufacturing plants, it is common for all maintenance costs to be charged to work orders, which are in turn charged to assets, usually at the equipment or functional location level. In some facilities, all costs, including labor, are charged to work orders. This process requires extensive and costly administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As with any other measurement, the purpose of measuring maintenance costs is to compare actual equipment maintenance costs to some target and to take action when the difference is significant. Most commonly, that action will be to rebuild, redesign or replace the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, for fixed manufacturing equipment, the cost of maintenance is seldom a reason for such action. Major rebuilds, redesigns or replacements usually occur because the equipment is unreliable, has operating costs that are too high, can no longer manufacture a product that can compete in the marketplace, can no longer meet changing environmental standards, or requires too much downtime for routine inspection and servicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unusual for the cost of maintenance itself to be a significant factor. If maintenance costs for a specific equipment item are thought to be too high, it is extremely likely that the equipment is also unreliable, and the cost of the losses resulting from that unreliability is many times greater than the maintenance costs. For this reason, it is much more important to measure reliability than it is to record the cost of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, work order records of maintenance labor costs are notoriously unreliable for several reasons, such as the people who enter labor records in the maintenance computer system recognize that this information has minimal value and as a result sometimes make little effort to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because detailed work order labor cost records are unlikely to have sufficient value to justify the recording cost, the practice of charging maintenance labor to area accounts is probably the most sensible approach. It is quite different for most mobile equipment, where maintenance costs may be the most significant factor when making decisions to overhaul or replace units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For infrastructure in manufacturing plants and especially service institutions, maintenance costs are critical, although the decisions that maintenance cost information may drive are more subjective and based on management standards. For example, the decision on whether to paint a facility every five years or every 10 years will normally be driven by a subjective assessment of appearance rather than a need to protect the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the budgeting process in many publicly funded institutions requires that maintenance and redesign activities are charged to different accounts, which significantly increases the administrative cost as well as the importance of accurately recording maintenance costs at the work order level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Z39PSCQa03s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SFA Soft Launches New Apps for Electrical, Pump Professionals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SFA Soft recently launched two new smartphone apps with more than 30 technical calculators for pumping machinery professionals and those who design and install electrical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric Calcs and Pump Calcs, which are available for both Apple and Android devices, can be downloaded for free through the App Store and Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Electric Calcs app calculators can determine the voltage drop in copper and aluminum wiring circuits, calculate real (true) power in three-phase transformers, and analyze transformer ratio data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Pump Calcs app calculators can estimate the required brake horsepower for a given centrifugal pump application, determine efficiency of a motor-driven centrifugal pump, and calculate the average fluid velocity in a pipe when the flow rate is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both free versions allow access to the basic technical calculators. There is a one-time cost of 99 cents for Electric Calcs and $1.99 for Pump Calcs to remove ads and enable the use of the more advanced calculators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Machine Criticality Ratings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/18/174bd8fd-ff49-4021-87b2-282ab021ed97_criticality.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 299px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;It is not uncommon for criticality ratings to be assigned to equipment. While this practice has some merit, the overall value may be questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment criticality is usually defined as &amp;quot;the consequence of failure of the equipment&amp;quot; and may be given a rating. A typical criticality rating for consequences that impact production in a multi-line process manufacturing operation is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where such a scale is used, there likely will be similar ratings for consequences related to safety, the environment and the impact on employees, the community or customer relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/18/89d15fc2-028a-4432-a778-fa8b32095a9e_table2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 309px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The criticality rating may be recorded against each item of equipment in the register and used by various maintenance business processes to provide special functions, e.g., to automate the expediting of repairs to spare parts or to select a distinctive label for repair tags. If used for such purposes, the rating has value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Using Criticality for Setting Maintenance Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem with criticality ratings is that they sometimes change and do not take into account the probability of failure. For example, a particular pump may be so important to production that it has an installed spare. Because of this spare, a failure would shut down a production line for only one hour to switch pumps and would thus result in a criticality rating of 6. However, if the pump or its spare is removed for repair, then the failure of the remaining pump would shut down the line for 10 hours while it is repaired. Its criticality rating should change from 6 to 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping criticality ratings up to date for this kind of change is an administrative task that is unlikely to be managed with discipline in most operations. Criticality ratings can also change when spare parts are being replenished (i.e., temporarily out of stock) and when different products are being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, just because a piece of equipment has a high criticality rating based on its impact on production, it does not mean that the failure of all of its components should have the same rating. For example, a large piece of mobile equipment may be very critical to the operation. However, while the failure of an engine or a wiper blade may both shut down the equipment, the time out of service will obviously differ. Similarly for a pump handling a dangerous chemical, the safety consequences of a mechanical seal failure may be much greater than a motor failure. For this reason, some have recommended that criticality ratings be assigned at the component level or even the failure mode level. Of course, this introduces a much greater level of administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The probability of a production interruption must also be considered. Very critical equipment usually will have some modes of failure that have a long development period (e.g., wear on boiler super-heater tubes), so their repairs may be planned for months or years in advance while maintenance on much less critical equipment continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance work on production equipment should be prioritized in terms of risk, typically the risk of a breakdown occurring prior to the next scheduled opportunity to make the necessary repairs. This risk is calculated as the consequence of failure (or criticality) multiplied by the probability of failure in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the consequences of a failure mode for any component can normally be estimated, the probability of failure is much less easily determined. Predictive maintenance techniques may help to quantify the probability, but experienced maintenance and operations personnel will generally be in the best position to make such an assessment. These individuals usually have a good idea of the equipment&amp;rsquo;s criticality without needing a rating system. In fact, they are the ones who likely will provide the criticality ratings for recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good operations/maintenance relationship with disciplined backlog management supported by a practical preventive maintenance program is preferable to a formal criticality rating system. The cost of implementing and maintaining criticality ratings can be significant, and if used blindly for setting work priorities, incorrect ratings will undoubtedly result in some unnecessary losses or costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Designing for Criticality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most manufacturing plants have a set of component standards to assist in the purchase of parts and to minimize the number of spare parts in inventory. These components are usually selected to provide the required reliability at the lowest cost. However, an experienced designer will also take the criticality of service into account when selecting components. The schematic below is of the water distribution system for a large paper mill with three independent operating lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/18/2714a6b2-4e23-424e-ab4a-c5c7c68ff56c_graphic.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 417px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Valves A and B both see the same conditions (cold water at about the same pressure and temperature), so the same valve would do an adequate job of isolating each pressure gauge. Should valve B fail, a very local shutdown, or perhaps no shutdown at all, would be required to replace it. However, if valve A were to fail, it could not be replaced without a total plant shutdown. If criticalities are considered during design, valve B should be a good industrial-quality valve, while valve A should be the best that money can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, the main header isolating valves each require a major plant shutdown for maintenance access and should also be of a very high quality. They are likely to be closed infrequently, and the valve selection should take this aspect of their operating context into account. Main isolating devices in electrical, water, air, effluent and other essential plant services are often the only equipment or components in the plant that will have a criticality rating of 1 (using the rating table above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, equipment criticalities are essential to consider during design and when setting work priorities. However, a criticality rating in the equipment records may be of little help to experienced maintenance and operations people. Where these ratings have value is for providing guidance to staff who support the operation but are not closely involved in day-to-day operations and maintenance, such as purchasing and the storeroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/fTbB7Hhlyz4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Power of Maintenance KPIs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/11/ac9b7d97-0995-4b6f-886a-794f792fade8_maintenance-kpis.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 283px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Managing maintenance is no different than any other business. You must make good decisions that add value. This means you need input and lots of it. Making decisions based on gut feelings just doesn&amp;#39;t cut it these days. Once repair and maintenance (R&amp;amp;M) dollars have been allocated, your organization will expect value to be delivered in the form of reliable assets. Key performance indicators (KPIs) can provide the input you need to help meet this lofty objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Ground Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KPIs can be very specific to an individual&amp;#39;s activity or broad enough to measure an entire plant&amp;#39;s performance. They can be leading or lagging, simple counts or complex calculations. However, they should follow a few simple ground rules to ensure quality input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should be easily connected to the business value that strong performance will deliver.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should be aligned with the current state of the organization. The percentage of proactive work will be very misleading if you are only capturing 50 percent or your work on work orders.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should be automated. Manual counts are riddled with errors and often get neglected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should follow a process or practice. Activities should not be added to a process solely to make the KPI measurable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should have reasonable, defined and understood targets. Be careful of the law of diminishing returns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metrics should be monitored, and responsible parties held accountable for their results. Building them into performance objectives and incentives has proven very successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Alignment to Business Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A well-defined maintenance business process must be executed in order to deliver the desired results. In other words, the engine needs to be running on all cylinders to provide the necessary horsepower to win the race. The figure below illustrates ArcelorMittal&amp;#39;s maintenance business process. Each component contains specific activities and practices that are essential to delivering business value to stakeholders. Each component&amp;#39;s activities are monitored with a set of standardized KPIs to provide managers with the input needed to make informed decisions and enact corrections and improvements as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/11/c6a5c0c9-5eb5-4497-8e47-08f04d53dfa8_plan,improve,control.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 373px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan component of the business process sets the stage for all other activities. It involves understanding the business objectives, identifying physical assets that support those objectives, analyzing the consequences and risks those assets represent, and establishing performance requirements needed to reach the business requirements. While these activities primarily lead to the development of targets for metrics used to monitor downstream activities, there are some examples of KPIs used to monitor this component, such as the percentage of assets with asset prioritization analysis completed and the maintenance budget as a percentage of the replacement asset value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improve component is all about work identification. This involves the development of a technically valid maintenance program for the assets identified in the plan phase. It is accomplished by using methodologies such as reliability-centered maintenance, maintenance task analysis and root cause analysis to identify the tasks that will most effectively mitigate the consequences of failure. Some examples of KPIs used to monitor progress include the number of failure modes identified, the percentage of maintenance action plans implemented, and the number of condition inspections implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The control component is about effectively executing the maintenance program developed and implemented in the improve component. Maintenance tasks are planned, scheduled and executed, and follow-up activity is performed to improve maintenance plans. This is called the &amp;quot;sustained maintenance loop.&amp;quot; Metrics monitor many aspects of this phase to understand the quality of maintenance planning, the effectiveness of scheduling and the efficiency of execution. Some examples include the percentage of backlog ready to work, planned vs. actual man-hours, the percentage of scheduled outage work orders completed, and the percentage of preventive maintenance compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The assess component is where performance is compared to targets to understand where further improvement is needed. Lagging KPIs are primarily reviewed in this phase. These KPIs vary based on the type of unit. For example, mean time between failures is valuable for continuous processes where each line stop results in significant yield loss. Batch processes tend to look more at delay rates or production metrics. Some examples include working ratio, heats per day, budget vs. actual repair and maintenance spending, and prime yield&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Calculation and Reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	KPIs can be automatically calculated and made available in real time on dashboards within reliability software. The input to the calculations come from the reliability system, the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), operating data and financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/11/9e47b785-d514-4402-b4c8-b0b135c46551_kpis-image3.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 378px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A standardized list of KPIs should be deployed at the corporate level, plant level and the individual business level within each plant. They can then be accessed for real-time data at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/11/9925d3af-24d1-4ad5-a83b-441396db56d8_kpis-image4.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dashboards can be created to meet the needs of specific roles in the organization such as plant managers, maintenance managers or planners. KPI data can also be compiled in monthly reports for review meetings and distribution to upper management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/11/e722a383-0803-4d07-adbf-16eaac301622_kpis-image5.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 484px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These key performance indicators can provide valuable input for making informed decisions. Good decisions will ensure business value that moves the company toward meeting its objectives. Just be sure your KPIs are defined, understood and communicated across your organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Grm2uM8mkTk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Can All Maintenance Work Be Planned?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/11/4/c4f0cd02-bf11-4884-b948-e94dc0ddc6fc_maintenance-work.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 314px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;A job that is well-planned will ensure that the intended scope is achieved, the quality is high and that time and effort are not wasted. On average, a well-planned job will take about half as long as a job that is not planned. This article looks at the function of planning in more detail and suggests some ways to ensure that all maintenance work, except genuine emergencies, is properly planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the definition of planning is deciding what to do and how to do it, then by definition, every maintenance job that is done is planned by someone. Where a position with the title &amp;quot;planner&amp;quot; exists, it is often assumed that the incumbent spends his or her day planning work. In reality, planners spend much of their time processing work orders, which is not planning, and completing other administrative tasks, such as scheduling. They actually may spend little time performing detailed planning. For the majority of work, the decisions on what to do and how to do it are left to the maintenance supervisor and, more often, the tradespeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The common process for handling smaller maintenance tasks, which often accounts for the majority of the maintenance effort, is to assign tradespeople to work that has not been well-defined. The scope of the work assignment then includes &amp;quot;planning&amp;quot; (i.e., identifying the problem, deciding on a workable solution, and finding tools and materials) and executing the repair. Work of this nature is difficult to estimate and schedule because the scope is unknown. If the planning function is left to the tradespeople on a job-by-job basis, it is most unlikely to be an efficient use of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ideally, all work should be planned in advance, especially work that has a tight deadline, such as shutdown work, and work that is isolated from the source of supplies and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the work management process, a decision should be made on the assignment of the planning function for each new job. If new work orders are reviewed daily by the maintenance and operations supervisors (a good practice), then this is an ideal time to decide if each job should be planned by a planner or by tradespeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the planning function is assigned to tradespeople, then it should be properly managed. Examples of good management include allowing time during PM inspection tours to plan the repair of problems that are found. A supply of simple forms for recording the work steps and the materials and tools required for each step should be included in the work order package for PM inspection tours. The PM work order should also specify the time allowed for this planning activity. Of course, this will work only if the PM administration process is designed to allow inspectors to quickly check to see if problems identified during their inspection already have a repair work order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another example of good management would include scheduling the planning of work by tradespeople as a part of their regular activities while following proper scheduling practices. For instance, if there is a high-priority job to be planned or executed in a remote location, then other lower priority work at that location should also be planned at the same time whenever practical. Work orders for these planning assignments can be readily estimated and need not be charged to the equipment. This planning effort will also allow a realistic estimate to be applied to the resulting repair work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, never allow any restrictive trade practices to interfere with planning. If a pipefitting trade exists and pipefitters have jurisdiction over pipe repairs, this should not prevent a PM inspector from another trade from listing the job steps and materials (bolts, gaskets, ladders, etc.) to replace a leaking gasket. Contractual restrictions should only apply to the physical repair work. In conservative organizations, this may be a highly contentious point, but it is worth resolving for everyone&amp;#39;s benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the planning function is assigned to tradespeople, its scope should be made clear. Typically, tradespeople will identify the job steps as well as the materials, tools and equipment required, while another non-trades position such as a planner and/or storeroom employee will have the responsibility to gather those items into a suitable work order kit prior to the work being scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Detailed planning, which is the process of thinking through a job, breaking it down into logical steps and listing all the materials, tools, equipment and labor required to do the work, does not come naturally to many people. However, it can be learned and will improve with practice. It is a skill that can be used for many activities in life, both on and off the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/xTPq7Wn6BCI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Entergy Plant Completes $58-million Maintenance Upgrades</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Entergy&amp;#39;s Palisades nuclear power plant in southwest Michigan recently returned to service after a $58-million investment to upgrade and inspect plant equipment, along with a $63-million investment in new fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant shut down on Sept. 16, 2015, to begin a planned refueling outage and was reconnected to the grid on Oct. 19, 2015. The outage put 1,600 skilled professionals and $58 million to work completing more than 9,000 tasks to refuel and make upgrades, inspections and replacements to prepare the plant for continuing safe and reliable service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This refueling outage was a great success,&amp;quot; said Tony Vitale, Palisades site vice president. &amp;quot;The equipment maintenance, replacements and upgrades prepared Palisades to deliver another 18 months of safe, clean, reliable electricity to southwest Michigan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the outage Palisades also completed safety enhancements ordered after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. Those enhancements will serve as greater defense against potential external events, such as tornados, flooding and earthquakes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In early September, Palisades also underwent an inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to address occupational radiation safety related to control rod drive replacement during the 2014 refueling outage. Because of corrective actions the plant has taken, the NRC returned the plant to the agency&amp;#39;s highest safety category. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations, Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including nearly 10,000 megawatts of nuclear power, making it one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading nuclear generators.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Boeing Introduces New Maintenance Record-keeping Tool for Airlines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Boeing recently introduced a digital records management capability to its Maintenance Performance Toolbox suite of products to optimize maintenance operations and reduce costs for airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Maintenance Performance Toolbox Records module provides an industry standard platform to manage scanned and digitally produced maintenance and flight records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new tool eliminates the operational challenge of managing paper-based maintenance records, working in tandem with other Maintenance Performance Toolbox application solutions to increase efficiencies related to both day-to-day airline maintenance operations and the management of leased airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Automation of the maintenance record-keeping process is a new and essential component of our Maintenance Performance Toolbox, and we are pleased to provide airlines with the foundation for establishing more efficient maintenance operations,&amp;quot; said Per Nor&amp;eacute;n, Boeing Digital Aviation vice president. &amp;quot;Our new records solution lowers costs related to daily records and the end of lease management, as well as eliminating redundant processes and reducing delays in aircraft maintenance processes. This new system truly allows airlines to unlock the potential of fleet-wide digital records management.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The records module creates intelligent digital maintenance documents featuring dynamic records search capabilities. The record-keeping tool also can improve airline maintenance workflow capabilities and tie into maintenance planning solutions, establishing systems that work in concert to further enhance the automation of processes and overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simple access to the records module is provided through Boeing&amp;rsquo;s Maintenance Performance Toolbox application. Boeing also offers access to records management capabilities for non-Toolbox customers through AerData&amp;#39;s digital aircraft records application.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Siemens, Minnesota Power Sign Service Agreement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/1/1683ece3-afa2-4d00-9ccd-cc9aa49054d7_siemens-image1.jpeg" style="width: 263px; height: 252px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Siemens recently signed a long-term agreement with Minnesota Power to provide service and maintenance for 149 D3-platform wind turbines installed at the Bison Wind Energy Center near New Salem, North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under terms of the agreement, Siemens will provide 10 years of service and maintenance for the D3 turbines installed in the first three phases of the Bison Wind Energy Center, as well as Bison Phase 4, which began operations in January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The commissioning of Bison 4 this past January brought the total capacity of the Bison complex to nearly 500 megawatts, making it the largest wind energy project in North Dakota. The project delivers power via a 465-mile, direct-current transmission line that connects the Square Butte Substation in Center, North Dakota, to Minnesota Power&amp;#39;s Arrowhead substation near Duluth, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Siemens and Minnesota Power have a long history of working together, and this is a continuation of our ongoing collaboration,&amp;quot; said Mark Albenze, CEO of Siemens Wind Service and Renewables business. &amp;quot;A committed supporter of renewable energy, Minnesota Power boasts the largest fleet of Siemens&amp;#39; D3 turbines in the U.S. We look forward to working closely with them to help with the continued reliability, affordability and sustainability of their renewable energy projects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Siemens currently provides service and maintenance for more than 3,700 installed wind turbines in the Americas region and more than 9,000 globally, with a combined generating capacity of approximately 22 gigawatts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Northrop Grumman, Air Force Sign B-2 Maintenance Agreement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/24/ef4a5043-d334-45d0-a310-73a590d839e1_stealth.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 157px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The U.S. Air Force recently signed a new maintenance agreement with Northrop Grumman to increase the number of B-2 stealth bombers available for combat and to reduce fleet sustainment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the contract, Northrop Grumman will give each B-2 an end-to-end overhaul &amp;ndash; a process called programmed depot maintenance (PDM) &amp;ndash; once every nine years. Each jet currently undergoes PDM once every seven years. The process, which includes a complete restoration of the jet&amp;#39;s exterior surfaces, will be performed at the company&amp;#39;s Aircraft Integration Center of Excellence in Palmdale, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This new approach to B-2 maintenance is a win-win for the Air Force and the nation,&amp;quot; said Brig. Gen. Eric Fick. &amp;quot;It will enhance the jet&amp;#39;s readiness to conduct global security missions and is expected to save taxpayers about $900 million in maintenance costs over the life of the fleet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new nine-year overhaul cycle will reduce the average length of B-2 PDM to 365 days, down from more than 400 days in previous years. Under the new rhythm, Northrop Grumman will induct a B-2 into PDM approximately once every six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The nine-year PDM cycle is part of an aggressive ongoing effort by Northrop Grumman and the Air Force to increase bomber availability,&amp;quot; said Pat McMahon, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems vice president and general manager. &amp;quot;Our experienced workforce has critically reviewed every PDM material and process for potential improvements. As a result, we&amp;#39;ve been able to reduce the length of the PDM process and increase the time between PDM periods.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the only long-range, large-payload U.S. military aircraft that can penetrate deeply into denied-access enemy air space, the B-2 can fly 6,000 nautical miles without refueling and more than 10,000 nautical miles with just one aerial refueling, giving it the ability to reach any point on the globe within hours.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Machine Troubleshooting</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/6/10/303ab842-3540-4c6d-92a8-52161992b15b_Troubleshooting.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 294px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Troubleshooters are highly skilled workers but are becoming an increasingly rare breed in the workforce. Managers from large manufacturers often have problems finding qualified troubleshooters. In the past, training courses only taught the basics, while the real troubleshooting skills were learned on the job over a long period of time from shadowing experienced maintenance personnel. Unfortunately, the majority of these skilled workers are now leaving the workforce for a well-deserved retirement, while an insufficient number of new maintenance workers possess this valuable skill set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real issue is that troubleshooting is essential for any manufacturer to stay competitive in today&amp;#39;s tough markets. Quick and effective machine troubleshooting is vital to keep paper-thin profit margins from slipping into the red. This places a huge responsibility on technical instructors to prepare workers to hit the ground running. Long gone are the days of a machine sitting idle for long periods of time while troubleshooters substitute one component after another based on their personal experiences or conjecture. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since it is not feasible to allow promising young troubleshooters to take years to acquire troubleshooting skills on the job, teaching these skills in a classroom environment is key. Future technicians and operators must gain real-world troubleshooting experience before they reach the production floor. Therefore, institutions such as community colleges and company training centers must be able to create equipment issues in many combinations to build troubleshooting expertise. Use of training equipment with the ability to insert a wide range of realistic faults into a system is critical so that workers can gain hands-on experience diagnosing and fixing the broad range of problems seen in the real world. To ensure proper procedures are being taught, a troubleshooting training program should use an industry-vetted curriculum that ensures the outcomes for every worker is consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Community colleges and industrial training centers are stepping up to meet this challenge with programs geared specifically toward teaching troubleshooting skills. While these programs may vary in teaching methods, effective troubleshooting, regardless of the specific technology, follows five basic steps: identify the symptoms, isolate the problem to a particular component, test the suspected component, repair or replace the component and test the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Identifying a malfunctioning machine&amp;#39;s symptoms is critical because it can shorten the troubleshooting process by placing the focus on only those components capable of causing those particular problems. Teaching future troubleshooters to first ask the operator to identify any observed symptoms in a malfunctioning machine is essential. No matter how well a troubleshooter is trained, the operator who daily runs and monitors that particular machine is much more familiar with its operation than anyone else, and his or her input is quite valuable at this stage. Too often inexperienced troubleshooters assume they know the answer when they truly don&amp;#39;t understand the question. When training troubleshooters, it is important to teach them not to overlook this crucial resource. Once the operator has identified the machine&amp;#39;s specific symptoms, it is much simpler to draw useful conclusions concerning the fault that is causing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Categorizing the probable fault based on the symptoms focuses a troubleshooter&amp;#39;s efforts to a significantly smaller area, which saves valuable time and money. A well-trained troubleshooter should be able to quickly categorize the problem into machine sequence, machine performance or system-related issues. Machine sequence relates to the order in which events occur, including actuator movements, pressure changes or speed changes. Machine performance refers to the characteristics of an actuator&amp;#39;s motion or output, such as speed or force output. System-related issues involve the overall system characteristics, including vibration, fluid temperature, overall system pressure, fluid leaks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, let&amp;#39;s consider a fluid power system to see how categorizing the fault is helpful. Machine sequence faults indicate problems with components that control movement, such as sensors, directional control valves or a PLC controller. Conversely, machine performance faults are commonly caused by output components or components that affect output like pressure-reducing valves, relief valves or pumps. Symptoms that fall into these two categories can quickly narrow troubleshooting efforts to specific machine areas and parts. When system-related faults such as leaks are reported, these point to issues likely to cause machine failure. In some cases, system-related faults accompany a sequence or performance fault and are helpful indicators of what may be causing the problem. This systematic approach quickly focuses the troubleshooter on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the problem is categorized, a testing methodology should be used to properly identify the failed component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Shotgun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every component or connection in the affected area is tested until the problem is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Half-Split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This method continually tests a point halfway between a known good test point and a known bad test point until the problem is identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Output-Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The output-back approach starts testing the system outputs and systematically works back toward the inputs until the problem is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Symptom and Cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This technique isolates the problem according to whether the component could cause the observed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many highly skilled troubleshooters recommend the symptom and cause method as the most effective. Teaching troubleshooters to focus only on those components that are capable of causing the observed symptoms saves time, which is why proper identification of a machine&amp;#39;s symptoms is critical. For this method to be effective, troubleshooters must not only understand a component&amp;#39;s function but also how it operates internally to achieve that function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the faulty component is identified through in-circuit testing, it should be tested out of circuit to verify its failure. Out-of-circuit testing isolates the component from the rest of the system and can prevent time wasted in replacing the wrong component. One parts manufacturer stated that nearly 70 percent of its returned parts were not defective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the problem is &amp;quot;fixed,&amp;quot; testing the system&amp;#39;s operation is the last step before signing off on the job ticket and walking away from the machine repair. The following example illustrates the importance of this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a hydraulic system&amp;#39;s main relief valve was replaced, the system started to show leakage. However, once the maintenance personnel left, the machine operator attempted to adjust the valve to the proper system pressure only to discover that this could not be done because the wrong replacement valve had been installed. This resulted in yet more downtime and almost double the labor cost to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industry needs more troubleshooters. As manufacturers strive to create quality products in less time, they are facing a desperate lack of these skilled workers. While community colleges and training centers are teaching these skills today, they are needed in a much greater capacity than is currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/HhYwKZ8nNuU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>2 Key Strategies to Reduce Downtime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/6/3/49ff3115-c572-41af-a142-65a882eee16d_sm strategy-1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In a recent industry survey, respondents attributed more than 20 percent of their unscheduled downtime to operator error. Since these respondents used canned answers as choices in their responses, it&amp;#39;s not surprising that the finger was pointed in the other direction. But what about maintenance error?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;#39;ve got a dirty little secret to share with you. More than 70 percent of failures are self-induced, and upward of 40 percent of that number is human error. There&amp;#39;s plenty of blame to distribute across all functions (engineering, maintenance, operations, purchasing, quality and management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the book &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Just Fix It, Improve It! A Journey to the Precision Domain,&amp;quot; the authors equate behaviors with 84 percent of failures. With these numbers being so high, don&amp;#39;t you think we should do something about them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two key components that can help you develop a strategy to address these bad behaviors. The long-term focus must be on defect elimination in order to achieve the precision domain. This will be discussed later. In the short term, the focus should be on standardized work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Standardized Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s amazing how many organizations rely on what I call &amp;quot;tribal knowledge.&amp;quot; They don&amp;#39;t have any operations checklists or startup and shutdown procedures. Maintenance has no traceable basis for the preventive maintenance (PM) tasks they have chosen. Often, tasks are written at a macro level, i.e., &amp;quot;check pump.&amp;quot; Check it for what? Corrective job plans rarely exist, or if they do, they seldom contain details such as clearances, torque, belt tension, etc. Without standardized work, there is no expectation of performance or behavior. How can you build these processes and procedures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Defect Elimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a defect elimination perspective, you must create small groups that are empowered to take action and fix things. If you were to ask an operator or mechanic, most of the time he or she could tell you exactly what the problem is or at least point to symptoms of the root causes. The problem is no one asks, and they don&amp;#39;t feel qualified to address it themselves, so the problems continue. Empower these small action teams to fix errors in procedures and improve the items identified as failure modes. People buy in to what they help create.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Best Ways to Measure Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/4/8/d6f3dd24-f246-4b80-a79a-304c6bf7fcde_measuring-reliability.jpeg" style="width: 301px; height: 283px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In an industrial setting, reliability is the &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; of maintenance, so it&amp;#39;s very important that it be measured. Maintenance is expensive, and you should know what it is buying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many ways to measure reliability, and the measurements should provide information that is useful for reliability management. The measurement process should also not take too much time or effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best way to make reliability measurements useful is to record losses at the &amp;quot;equipment location&amp;quot; level, which is normally the level at which individual items of manufacturing or processing equipment are identified and numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot; are the units of production that were not manufactured (or were not of saleable quality) but could have been if all had gone as planned. Losses may have a number of causes, including insufficient incoming inventory, too much outgoing inventory, raw material quality, equipment breakdowns or slowdowns, lack of trained operators, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best way to record losses is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish the maximum production rate for each major manufacturing unit (usually a manufacturing operation, which has some incoming and outgoing storage for process inventory) for each product or product grade.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish a target production for each manufacturing unit for each product (e.g., 90 percent of maximum production) for each shift worked.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Account for all losses below this target using a simple recording system, as described below.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review all losses for each shift and ensure that they have been recorded in a way that will allow the information gathered to be used to identify opportunities for improvement. There should be a position, such as a reliability or process engineer, with the responsibility for these daily reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regularly analyze loss records and use the information to develop and maintain a program of continuous improvement, always focusing on the highest value opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Losses should be recorded as soon as they occur, usually by the department operator because that&amp;#39;s the one position that is always there and knows about each event. A simple paper form could be used, but an electronic log is preferred so that the information does not have to be re-entered for analysis. Some maintenance computer systems have the functionality to record losses, but most do not. A suitable log can be designed and built for your operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The information to be recorded by the operator for each event as soon as it occurs should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The name of the manufacturing unit&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The date and time the event started&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The date and time the event ended&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of production units lost&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The cause of the loss (if known)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The equipment number and description if the loss is caused by an equipment problem&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Any other information that may be of use in future analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The daily assessments by the operating specialist should review the information, confirm the cause and assign responsibility, e.g., operations, mechanical, electrical, etc. Please note that the department to which the loss is assigned should be the department that is in the best position to ensure it does not happen again. It is not the department that is &amp;quot;to blame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The graph below shows one result of using such a loss recording system. After analyzing two years of production loss records, it was determined that 87 of 12,000 equipment items contributed 80 percent of all unscheduled downtime. A preventive maintenance program focusing on these 87 items and similar equipment resulted in the loss reduction shown in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/4/8/d1661d75-908a-4fc9-8905-359dcc6dc604_Veleda.jpeg" style="width: 561px; height: 455px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are other ways of measuring reliability, such as automated overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) instrumentation, that may well be justified in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is the most important and useful key performance indicator (KPI) for maintenance and should be reported regularly, with the ability to filter for each operating department and maintenance discipline. The results form the basis for a program of continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/gUmmGmqZyA8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Ensure Your Reliability Journey is Successful</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/25/6d68238c-d6c2-489a-a298-a1966f6af97d_dupont-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 253px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Today&amp;#39;s manufacturing plants are a mosaic of many moving parts. In some cases, the same part is used to do different things. In one application, failure of the part may only be a small consequence, while in a different application, the failure may cause a major catastrophe, resulting in considerable loss of time and product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As each plant is different, with its own unique set of potential problems and mitigating tasks, the identification and mitigation of high-consequence failures requires conscious effort, experience and knowledge. A strong focus on reliability is vital to maintaining first-pass, first-quality production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to remember that reliability is not a characteristic but rather a continuous journey. One of the most important objectives of this journey is to identify and eliminate defects that can compromise systems and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where reliability is concerned, a defect is anything that is not perfect, whether that condition is related to a single piece of equipment or an entire operation. A defect can be as simple as a broken gear tooth or as complex as an entire production line that cannot handle the demands being placed upon it. What is most important is to track the defects back to their sources and address the issues to prevent the defect&amp;#39;s return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Defects are caused by a variety of sources, including normal degradation of items in their environment, design deficiencies, improper manufacture or use of the item, exposure to contaminants, improper repairs, collateral damage from other failures or inadequate preventive maintenance. A defect condition may lie dormant for years, only to be revealed when the defective item is stressed in an abnormal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the principles of defects and their sources can be described broadly, specific failures are defined in terms of their causes and their consequences. A pump impeller failure will have different causes from a motor bearing failure. Depending on the location of a part within a system, a failure could cause anything from a reduction in product quality to a complete line shutdown. Fundamental to understanding how to improve reliability of a manufacturing facility is the understanding of how the items can fail and, once they fail, understanding the effect of those failures. Once you understand the effect of the items, you can then design an appropriate mitigating task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mitigating tasks are all around us, and they protect us in many different ways. Some common mitigating tasks include applying sunscreen to prevent sunburn, using a speedometer to avoid getting a speeding ticket or washing your hands to avoid getting sick. In other words, mitigating tasks are the things you do to prevent or minimize harmful consequences. Mitigating tasks do not happen automatically, nor are they free. They are part of a reasoned analysis done by an expert. The expert makes a recommendation for mitigating tasks based on a cost-benefit analysis of the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, once these high-consequence items are identified, systems must be designed to reduce the consequence. Once the systems are in place, they must stay active to protect against future failure events. The effort needs to be ongoing so that as things change, the analysis is repeated to ensure the systems are still adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7 Steps to Improved Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The old saying goes, &amp;quot;The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&amp;quot; This also is true of the journey to reliability. But what is the first step?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Know the Bad Actors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A popular approach to reliability improvement is to identify those items that seem subject to chronic failure and tag them as the &amp;quot;worst actor.&amp;quot; Among the metrics to look at in determining bad actors are mean time between failures (MTBF), maintenance costs, emergency work or average maintenance costs over a period of time for equipment or groups of equipment in the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Understand the Trends and Root Causes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In studying bad actors, the following questions can help uncover the root cause of the chronic failure: &amp;quot;When did the problem begin?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Was it always like this?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Was there some initiating event that caused the level of reliability to change?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Know the Condition of Critical Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A popular practice is known as &amp;quot;predictive maintenance,&amp;quot; though this is often a misnomer. In general, this refers to a given number of diagnostic tests routinely conducted on plant equipment with the goal of providing information on incipient failure of the machine under test. However, in practice, predictive maintenance does not provide a prediction, but rather it flags equipment showing signs of trouble. The routine diagnostic tests are cost-effective, and the information they produce is highly valuable if used to make timely decisions about the equipment&amp;#39;s maintenance requirements. A more accurate name, and one that inspires proper use of the tools, is &amp;quot;condition monitoring,&amp;quot; which can be a valuable failure mitigation task. While it does not prevent the failure, it often gives clues as to the cause and future prevention of the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Know the Pattern of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers can evaluate the failure history of equipment items to find out if an item is performing as expected or if it is subject to quality issues from poor quality parts or poor assembly techniques. This process is called distribution analysis, and it is a powerful failure analysis technique that, if applied correctly, can identify and ultimately eliminate chronic failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Understand the Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance and reliability are the convergence of multiple effective resources correlated in time. A great deal of skill and attention to detail is required to organize resources so the right people with the right tools use the right procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Experts in root cause failure analysis categorize the data they collect about a failure into five categories, called the five &amp;quot;Ps&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;People &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;What is the skill level for the jobs they need to perform? How is their attention to detail?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Parts &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;What parts are commonly used for repairs? How are they stored? How many? Who provides the parts? What is the quality?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Procedures&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Do written procedures exist? Are they followed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;What documentation is used to track the activities of people and usage of equipment? Where are the maintenance records?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Practices &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;What practices are common? Where did they come from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers look at the five &amp;quot;Ps&amp;quot; whenever they are investigating the reasons for poor reliability. Whatever defects are causing low reliability can be found within these five &amp;quot;Ps.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Model the Production Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the appropriate systems and organizational structure to support those systems are in place, the design of the equipment must be considered. Ideally, this would be done before the production line is built, but companies often inherit production lines that were designed years ago. Does this mean they are stuck with poorly designed equipment and systems? Not if there is an opportunity to improve the design. The question is not &amp;quot;can we afford to do it?&amp;quot; but rather &amp;quot;can we afford not to do it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the tools that can help uncover weaknesses in the design of a system is reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) modeling. Modern RAM models can show the value of design improvements along with structured preventive and predictive tasks that are part of an overall reliability improvement strategy. Models also give indication of the benefits of proposed improvements before the improvement is made. This can contribute to a significant reduction of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Make Focused Investments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where the analysis indicates that a weakness exists, a focused improvement can help. A focused improvement effort can help to substantiate the idea that &amp;quot;we can do this.&amp;quot; Once effectively addressed, bad actors (usually one at a time) cease to cause problems. This gives the organization a chance to embrace requisite changes, implementing them slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the organization begins to understand that the changes are positive, resistance drops and the pace of change can accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that once these short-term goals in reliability have been achieved, the journey is not over. Reliability depends on gaining ground against defects and then setting new goals in a process of continuous improvement. Once accomplished, the steps described above are merely the groundwork for achieving improved and consistent product quality, uptime that meets or exceeds demand, and safety records that may at one time have been considered out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Nbx02FBSOw8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Simple Tips to Decrease Downtime, Increase Productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/11/04c3b011-554c-48e3-9876-71f40da5276c_productivity.jpeg" style="width: 425px; height: 285px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Every plant manager&amp;#39;s goal is to decrease downtime and increase productivity. Here are some tips for optimizing processes without putting strain on employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Train and Retrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Put a student driver behind the wheel of a Formula One race car, and you&amp;#39;re not going to get the most out of that vehicle. Industrial machinery is the same. Put it in the hands of untrained operators, and productivity is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers of industrial machinery usually perform onsite training during and after installation. However, many of them are happy to provide ongoing training &amp;mdash; but you may have to ask. It is in a manufacturer&amp;#39;s best interest to make sure plant personnel get the most out of their equipment; it results in fewer breakdowns, faster troubleshooting and repairs, greater customer satisfaction, more business and more referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial trade shows are opportune times for operator training as well. Manufacturers spend tens of thousands of dollars to exhibit their equipment and are eager to get a return on that investment any way possible. Providing training to plant personnel is a very good use of their time &amp;mdash; and yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Retraining is also a vital part of the productivity equation. Operators and foremen should not only receive scheduled training, but should be required to pass a test or obtain a certification based on your criteria. Operator complacency and outdated skill sets lead to productivity losses, and are often hard to see. A formal training and certification program is a reliable method of overcoming these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Upgrade and Retrofit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers improve their equipment regularly and relentlessly. While it is a vital business attribute, manufacturer innovation means a plant that purchased a machine two years ago has a productivity disadvantage versus a competitor who purchased a newer version of the machine six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are, however, opportunities to upgrade old equipment to bring it up to the performance level of newer generations and models. Perhaps the most obvious candidates for upgrading are in controls and diagnostics. Computer technology advances at lightning speed. Retrofitting state-of-the-art controls and diagnostics technology on a piece of equipment can pave the way for dramatic productivity gains. Machine performance can be tracked and analyzed more quickly and accurately, operational problems can be identified and repaired more quickly, throughput data can be collected and reviewed in more detail, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operations leadership should meet with equipment manufacturers regularly to discuss upgrade and retrofit options. In addition to improving productivity, upgrades offer tremendous financial benefit because they extend the life of the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Look for Less Obvious Productivity Killers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What brings down productivity in many operations are not big problems with training or equipment but a lot of little problems that go unnoticed. Highly efficient operations notice them, understand their impact on productivity and address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Environmental factors fall into this category. If a plant is too hot, cold or noisy, workers lose energy, enthusiasm and the ability to focus clearly on the task at hand. Even something as simple as putting a padded floor mat on a concrete floor can produce immediate improvement in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material handling is another area where relatively small changes can produce meaningful productivity gains. For instance, connecting two high-performance machines with 30 feet of conveyor rather than have workers manually transport work in process might save several man-hours over a three-shift operation &amp;mdash; as well as reduce injury and health-care expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Parts and maintenance are two other areas where the downtime battle can be won or lost. Most important is to not be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Saving a few thousand dollars by keeping spare parts and replacement inventory levels low could cost tens of thousands of dollars if a $100 machine part fails and the company has to shut down for two shifts while waiting for a new one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Likewise, companies may be tempted to scale back on maintenance staffs and hours when business conditions are unfavorable. But there is a good reason why those Formula One cars make frequent pit stops. No matter how good the machine and how efficient the operators are, wear and tear will eventually bring the entire operation to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reduce downtime and increase productivity, look carefully at the equipment, the operators and all aspects of the operation that affect them. Above all, look at productivity holistically. Focusing on only one or two things may indeed improve productivity, but those gains could be wiped out by ignoring something else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ROuOTOPp7ZI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Use Benchmarking to Improve Reliability and Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/2/11/e6203ba2-d69b-404e-ad4c-a8864c166f8a_benchmark.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;It&amp;#39;s commonly understood that safety in the workplace is a collective responsibility within an organization.&amp;nbsp;But this wasn&amp;#39;t always the case.&amp;nbsp;Decades ago, safety was the responsibility of the safety department.&amp;nbsp;Then &amp;quot;thought leaders&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; those informed and innovative thinkers who inspire and enlighten us &amp;mdash; realized how critical safety is to the success and sustainability of a manufacturing facility.&amp;nbsp;Culture change ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In much the same way, reliability is now arcing its way along the path safety once took.&amp;nbsp;The significance of reliability is making its way out of reliability departments and into corporate boardrooms.&amp;nbsp;Many executives are beginning to realize that reliability is one of the most overlooked opportunities for growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No manufacturing facility is 100-percent reliable. There is always some level of waste due to inefficiencies and unreliability. So opportunities to improve exist, and these improvements can impact three key areas in which every organization wants to improve: customer loyalty, employee satisfaction and, of course, profitability. However, improvement is a journey that requires time, culture change and dedication to performance. There are no shortcuts, and the journey can never be completed without a commitment to continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, an increasing focus on reliability is putting many forward-thinking organizations on the path to high-level performance and even higher profitability. The path begins with executive support and is marked by a company-wide shift in focus toward reliability.&amp;nbsp;This shift in focus is what sets top organizations apart from others when an improvement initiative is undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Proactive Culture Change is Linked to Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The more proactive an organization is about change management, the more adaptable it is to change. Successful behavioral shifts drive a company to become failure-free more quickly, significantly impacting the speed at which the reliability journey develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Achieving reliability becomes possible when management believes it is possible and encourages proactivity. Failing to address an abnormal indicator (however small) immediately makes it more likely that the sub-par will become accepted as normal &amp;mdash; and that a slide to failure will begin. First-quartile (Q1) performers encourage proactive measures at the earliest sign of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every year, new technology and tools become exceptional reliability resources. However, as with safety, unless the organization is proactively striving toward becoming failure-free, improvements will be slow to materialize. Q1 performers actively address technology improvements, streamlined work processes, and improved diagnostics and communications. And they continuously devote effort toward becoming more proactive, seeking to understand any failure mechanisms that occur in the system so that they can pass this knowledge onto others for the benefit of the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Shortcuts to Top Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations can get sidetracked on their reliability journey when there is pressure to put cost-cutting measures ahead of failure-free performance.&amp;nbsp;When cost-cutting becomes the chief mechanism for achieving financial targets, reliability suffers &amp;mdash; as does customer service.&amp;nbsp;Organizations who succumb to the cost-cutting approach may realize short-term (but unsustainable) improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Top performers understand that improved performance follows a path known as the inverted C (with the C turning counter-clockwise). This path may initially require more spending in order to improve reliability, but the resulting reliability culture will have a significant, positive impact on cost. Organizations that try to cut costs directly will have less success. Studies show that it is simply not possible to achieve sustainable improvement through cost-cutting mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Achieving sustainable performance means initially investing more to create results. In time, however, the spending becomes more targeted and realizes higher returns. Spending is then driven down, while reliability is on the upswing, creating the aforementioned inverted C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	High Performance and Reduced Spending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Higher performance and reduced maintenance spending can be achieved once a certain level of reliability is attained.&amp;nbsp;When companies can commit to the journey and apply long-term focus on continued process improvement, reliability is established.&amp;nbsp;Then, continuing proactive performance improvement combined with targeted maintenance spending leads to sustainable reliability increases and spending decreases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultimately, the highest performing organizations are able to consistently find the optimum amount of maintenance spending that delivers the highest operational availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Time for Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Becoming reliable does not happen overnight.&amp;nbsp;The journey requires significant planning, effort and buy-in from all staffing levels.&amp;nbsp;Understandably, the further an organization is from Q1 performance, the longer it will take to achieve top-tier performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, most companies begin to make progress four years following the launch of a performance improvement initiative. Throughout the process, these organizations must stay focused, even amidst the temptation to cut costs in order to realize short-term financial gains.&amp;nbsp;But staying on course is critical. Along the journey, companies must modify work practices and processes and, at times, increase spending in targeted areas to revitalize assets. These are not easy tasks. It takes time to realize sustainable gains, but in the end the journey to reliability pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Continuous Improvement through External Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once organizations start seeing year-over-year performance improvements, they begin to realize that the next level of performance measurement will require an external lens. The only way to truly measure whether performance levels are competitive is with external benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations that focus on improving reliability eventually realize that they must measure themselves against the best in the industry to know if their approach toward improvement is keeping pace with the competition. Only through consistent, external benchmarking is an organization able to measure itself competitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When companies fail to set out on the journey of reliability and performance improvement, profitability isn&amp;#39;t maximized. In addition, without external benchmarking, untapped potential is unknown and opportunity may be left on the table. Top performance can only be achieved by improvements in reliability as verified by external benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/PSLYL_ngm0U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Importance of Ground Testing in Electrical Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/2/4/98aeea4d-65e7-4b9f-acaf-e5c7a7ced0a0_electrical.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 403px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;There are two types of ground testing that should be performed at your facility. The first is done during the building process to ensure that the electrical system is installed properly. The second is routine ground testing that should be completed to make certain the grounding system continues to function in the manner it was designed. This ground testing must be done correctly, as errors can be dangerous and costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Understanding Grounding and Bonding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The grounding path provides a low-resistance path for electricity to travel. Electrical power must travel from the source through a load and then return to the source&amp;nbsp;through the neutral connection. The ground connection offers a secondary path for safety. This return path must provide the least resistance to the current. The general requirement of the National Electric Code (NEC) is no more than 25 ohms of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bonding offers a connection to all of the ground conductors of an electrical system. Grounding fault systems primarily protect equipment, while ground fault circuit protection keeps individuals safe. However, the best grounding system in the world will not provide any protection if the electrical components in your facility are not bonded to it. Likewise, bonds will not offer protection without grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Consequences of Ground Failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not having a solidly grounded system can result in the loss of expensive equipment, critical data and even human lives. Equipment without adequate grounding can experience&amp;nbsp;damaging spikes or voltage surges. The loss of ground can cause sensitive equipment to lose data or process it incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Intermittent failures can also create problems from random electrical shocks to equipment failures that are difficult to locate. The equipment often is blamed for the failure when, in fact, it is a lack of a solid ground. For example, when random electrical shocks were experienced in a fire station shower area, it was determined after extensive testing that a portion of the building was operating like a capacitor. Static electricity was building up, and without a proper ground bond, the electricity discharged through an individual using the facilities. The problem was intermittent because it took time for enough energy to build up and reach a discharge potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reasons for Grounding or Bonding Failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, connections or bonds can loosen. The wrong materials used to form the initial connection can fail even after being previously adequate. Corrosion can damage the connectors and the ground rods. In one extreme case, chemicals were contained in soil-dissolved ground rods that had been fully tested at installation. While the tops of the grounding rods were present and visible, only a few inches of material were remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Professional Ground Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The correct methods and equipment must be used to produce the right data for your grounding system. For example, a clamp-on test or&amp;nbsp;stakeless method enables testing to be faster and easier. However, it should not be used to measure soil resistance. This technique is also not recommended for complex grounding systems that have a metallic loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All factors of the grounding system must be calculated properly. For instance, after&amp;nbsp;heavy rainfall, the soil being tested might offer much less resistance than it would under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thorough ground testing should be part of your facility&amp;rsquo;s complete electrical maintenance plan. The 2015 edition of the National Fire Protection Association&amp;rsquo;s 70E standard includes new requirements for electrical safety. Make sure your facility is in compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Keys to Improve Maintenance Workflow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/21/60bdb695-21fc-4b93-b8d2-22f1f3860788_image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Regardless of what your company manufactures, two things are essential for product quality and customer satisfaction: how you manage, maintain and measure employees&amp;#39; work; and how you manage your equipment&amp;#39;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The road to these two goals isn&amp;#39;t always a clear path. Many organizations try to gain control of their work processes and equipment without first establishing the means to control the work and measure outcomes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before discussing some strategies to help you improve workflow and better integrate equipment availability and maintenance into your planning, let&amp;#39;s explore the biggest challenge that companies face: developing a strong, viable work management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This goes against our standard operating procedures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have time to change the system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve always done it this way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;#39;ve heard these statements within your organization, it&amp;#39;s time to go deeper. It&amp;#39;s impossible to address the organizational behaviors that encourage or discourage change without first understanding your organization&amp;#39;s culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what&amp;#39;s culture? It&amp;#39;s the pattern of shared basic assumptions that your management team and employees have learned over time by solving the company&amp;#39;s internal and external challenges. It&amp;#39;s how they perceive, think and feel about your company&amp;#39;s problems. And it&amp;#39;s about how they&amp;#39;ve historically addressed those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cultural forces are powerful because they operate outside of our conscious awareness. This is why individuals cannot consistently outperform their organization&amp;#39;s embedded culture. Even in the face of overwhelming challenges, people continue to act according to their cultural assumptions, even when they are not correlated to actual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cultures exist in stable states and will always revert to the state of lowest stress (comfort zone). Each state exhibits a predictable set of behaviors, i.e., sub-optimization, change resistance, risk aversion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s difficult to get just a little better and have that become a permanent state. This is why improvement initiatives often underperform and sometimes fail. The best process is of little value unless the organization&amp;#39;s culture is aligned to support it. In other words, implementing any improvement measure requires aligning both process and behavior. This is the single biggest challenge for any organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leadership must provide positive reinforcement of the new direction and its value to the organization. Through training, ongoing coaching and performance feedback, behaviors can change. They won&amp;#39;t change all at once, and not for everyone at the same pace, but they will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How will you know when the improvements are sustainable? As with almost everything else, behavior must be measured, and changes in behavior must be trended to ensure that improvement efforts are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have a good handle on your company&amp;#39;s current culture and how its evolution can support new processes, you&amp;#39;ll be in a strong position to assess your workflow, your resources and the equipment that supports it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Workflow and Maintenance: Models for Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If your company is already on the road to cultural evolution, it&amp;#39;s time to assess your work products and the processes that support (or hinder) them based on your overarching goals and objectives. The model below shows the elements that must be fully implemented to gain control of your work process and the maintenance measures that support them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/21/a988a970-eeff-4d1e-8d17-8b915060d5a7_figure 1a.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 315px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The process begins by identifying the steps to be implemented and culminates by defining the most efficient use of available, but limited, labor resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once your facility has mastered workflow, the focus shifts to gaining control of the equipment. By systematically applying work-control efficiencies and proactively maintaining equipment, you&amp;#39;re effectively deploying resources toward equipment availability and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As this model illustrates, work control enables more work with the same level of labor resources. Equipment control allows a more effective application of fewer of those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/21/7bd301cd-1c3b-4633-b071-00e362bc93f1_figure 2a.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 431px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the steps above offer a roadmap, your company will also need to establish a high order of discipline to fully implement your improved approach to efficiency. This includes establishing clear responsibilities for every step of each element in the process, which will involve a good deal of training and practice. You&amp;#39;ll also need to set up a viable management system to monitor and report key performance indicators (KPIs), key results indicators (KRIs) and the process behaviors that sustain your improvement measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Successful organizations with productive employees and happy customers have robust work processes that are supported by reliable, available equipment. When they master how work flows and equipment is maintained, they are able to more proactively focus on sustaining and growing the new process and less and less on reactive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that in order to gain the most benefit from these processes and practices, the organization&amp;#39;s culture and its attendant behaviors must be in synch with its plans and goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Gi6WES19umo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Day &amp; Zimmermann Awarded Maintenance Contract at Palo Verde</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Day &amp;amp; Zimmermann recently announced that its engineering, construction and maintenance group has been awarded a three-year contract by Arizona Public Service Company (APS) to provide maintenance services at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Phoenix. Mobilization and transition is underway for a January 2015 start work date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a significant contract for Day &amp;amp; Zimmermann,&amp;quot; said Guy Starr, president of DZ Atlantic. &amp;quot;We are excited about expanding our partnership with APS to enhance value for Palo Verde and to provide more opportunities for Day &amp;amp; Zimmermann and its employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Arizona&amp;#39;s largest and longest-serving electricity utility, APS serves nearly 1.2 million customers in 11 of the state&amp;#39;s 15 counties. Palo Verde is operated by APS and jointly owned by APS, Salt River Project, Southern California Edison Co., El Paso Electric, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, Southern California Public Power Authority and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We anticipate a strong, mutually beneficial relationship with Day &amp;amp; Zimmermann that will serve to continue to improve our processes, reduce our costs and strategically position us to safely and efficiently generate electricity for the long term,&amp;quot; said Bob Bement, senior vice president of operations at Palo Verde.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Improve Maintenance with the Internet of Things</title>

	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/11/25/77198f14-a384-4959-89ab-bc5f67e6f460_IOT-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 280px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Every day we are hearing more and more about the Internet of things (IOT), the next generation of the Internet, but what exactly does it mean? Essentially, the Internet of things is the interconnection of everyday devices to the Internet. The concept of the IOT is so big that it has been described as the fourth industrial revolution after steam, mass production and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, you can control your heating system via your phone or tablet so your house is at the right temperature when you get home. In the future, technicians will be able to see equipment failure codes on their Google glass in real time as the breakdown is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to&amp;nbsp;Gartner Inc., there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the Internet of things by 2020. This growth is largely due to the availability of faster and more reliable mobile networks, where no fixed line connection is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the coming years, the IOT will be fundamental in improving productivity and efficiency everywhere. It will lead to more efficient power management at plants and factories by automatically adjusting environment control systems to reduce energy consumption when it is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, lighting and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems can be switched to a lower mode when systems in the immediate area are powered down. The IOT will also enhance asset management processes by introducing more automation, real-time data analysis and intelligent decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are seven ways the IOT can improve the way assets are managed, but undoubtedly there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Greater Adoption of Predictive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The main reason for applying IOT to manage your assets is predictive maintenance. Rather than performing routine calendar-based inspections and component replacement, predictive techniques monitor equipment for pending failures and notify you when a part replacement is required. Sensors embedded in equipment check for abnormal conditions and trigger work orders when safe operating limits are breeched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When a predictive maintenance strategy is working effectively, maintenance is only performed on machines when it is required, thus reducing the parts and labor costs associated with replacements.&amp;nbsp;With more and more systems shipping with Internet connectivity, the concept of predictive maintenance is likely to expand exponentially in the Internet of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Real-Time Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Machine-to-machine (M2M) is defined as the technologies that allow machines to communicate with each other. The Internet of things takes M2M to the next level by including a third element: data. The availability of all machine data in one virtual network gives original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) the ability to aggregate and analyze the data to generate better predictive analytic models. Rather than waiting for a system to fail, manufacturers are able to accurately predict failure because sensors start reporting back when operating conditions trend out of specification. By accurately mapping user behavior, identifying failure patterns and quickly recognizing recurring issues, OEMs will be able to design out failures, improve their product and guarantee uptime. This should result in increased customer satisfaction and fewer warranty claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Accurate Performance Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Availability, reliability and other key performance metrics such as mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) can be calculated automatically by the system and fed to reporting dashboards. This removes the human element in capturing all downtime, ensuring the data is as accurate as possible. In addition, reliability metrics from different customer sites can be analyzed to identify best practice for implementation around the world.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Automatic Software Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Software changes can improve equipment performance or eliminate technical issues. Internet-connected machines make the software upgrade process easier and more efficient. When software fixes or patches are needed, the OEM vendor can push the upgrades to all systems in the fleet at the same time without customer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Recommended Repair Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When equipment goes down, failure data from various sources can be gathered, aggregated and analyzed in real time within the cloud. Repair options can be taken automatically by the system, and actions can be recommended to the technician if necessary. All possible failure data will be used to direct the repair, including system operating conditions at the time of failure, previous repair data from the computerized maintenance management system (&lt;a href="http://www.maintenanceassistant.com/cmms/"&gt;CMMS&lt;/a&gt;), wear patterns and operating data from the equipment fleet. In effect, the technician will be presented with all the information needed for more effective decision-making and the fastest route to resolution. Deploying a CMMS with an application programming interface (API) that makes connection with IOT devices possible will be crucial in ensuring the actionable information can be presented to the end user in a usable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Tighter Parts and Inventory Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective inventory control can have a significant impact on limiting equipment downtime and controlling maintenance budgets. Connected stockrooms that proactively monitor inventory movements and stock on hand to ensure the site is only holding what is needed will become commonplace in facilities everywhere. Through predictive maintenance and data analysis, OEMs will be able to optimize the recommended spare parts lists, freeing up much needed capital and increasing customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	7. Remote Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to unplanned breakdown maintenance, the IOT will make repairing geographically dispersed assets a breeze. As mentioned above, it will reduce unnecessary service visits to remote or geographically dispersed assets through predictive maintenance. Imagine connected assets such as wind farms, substations and pumps generating their own work orders in the CMMS with a proposed list of action items and recommended list of spares to complete the job. This will reduce the mean time to repair, which will in turn reduce the costs associated with those emergency repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every business type can find bottom-line value from IOT devices and services, but this will only occur when the IOT seamlessly interacts with other applications such as CMMS software. The IOT can also be a game-changer for OEMs. It will redefine the business model as equipment vendors supplement their offerings with software and data analytics services. Hardware will ship with greater computing power, becoming more intelligent and more connected. OEMs will create added value through ongoing monitoring and analysis, improving reliability while reducing unnecessary maintenance costs. Organizations can then allocate their resources in more efficient ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The true value of the Internet of things can only be fully realized when you take a holistic view of asset management. Powerful virtual cloud networks will continually collect, aggregate and model data to then accurately predict failures and put contingencies in place to limit their impact on system availability. The IOT will become fundamental in improving asset reliability and driving cost takeout by delivering real-time, intelligent and actionable data to connected systems or the end user. Although it may take time for your company to become an IOT data-driven organization, the change is coming, and you should be prepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/GN1eamhWwto" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Define World-Class Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/11/6/05e690fd-64e6-4eed-986a-3d7e182b0856_ardentb83.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 388px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Most everyone would agree that striving for world-class maintenance status is a good thing, but what exactly does this mean and how do you know when you get there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An athlete knows there are world records to beat because the records for any given event are measured in seconds, pounds or feet. These metrics signal if the athlete has beaten the previous records, elevating him or her to &amp;quot;world class.&amp;quot; In business, organizations such as Fitch, Moody&amp;#39;s, and Standard and Poor&amp;#39;s rate companies from AAA through D. Again, these services use generally accepted measures that let companies know when they achieve world-class status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given all the engineering and metrics involved, you would expect a similarly crisp, uniform definition of world-class maintenance. However, if you do a&amp;nbsp;Google search for &amp;quot;world-class maintenance,&amp;quot; you will get approximately 586 million results. When you scan through some of the results, you will not see any common references cited or any uniform definition of world-class maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be fair, there are many consulting and engineering firms that provide services for improving maintenance effectiveness and efficiency to their own definition of world class, and virtually all have a set of benchmarks they use to assess maintenance performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are some common examples of world-class performance from a&amp;nbsp;much&amp;nbsp;larger unofficial list that seems to have been developed by consensus over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance schedule compliance is greater than 90 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance overtime is less than 5 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance direct work is greater than 75 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planned maintenance work is greater than 90 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PM schedule compliance is 100 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The percentage of work covered by a work order is 100 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order actual hours / work order hours planned is 90 to 110 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment availability is at least 90 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment productivity is at least 95 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overall equipment effectiveness is at least 77 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some say world-class maintenance means being in the top 5 percent of certain metrics. Of course, it would be great to be way up there, but should that be the only measure of world-class maintenance? Or is this more akin to being the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind &amp;ndash; you&amp;#39;re up here only because everyone else is down there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, is world-class maintenance just the result of achieving benchmarks that others don&amp;#39;t? What if the grading is not on the curve, as it were? My old math teacher used to say he didn&amp;#39;t care how well we did against each other but against the right answers. No one was guaranteed an A for answering more questions correctly than the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	World-class maintenance is not just about the maintenance practices of the maintenance organization in a vacuum. It is about the way the entire organization uses all the means at its disposal to protect its ability to produce exceptional value for its customers. It is a journey, not a destination &amp;mdash; a process, not a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is no shortage of metrics, benchmarks and strategies to help keep you on the path of continuous improvement, but exceptional performance comes from being part of an organization that&amp;nbsp;requires&amp;nbsp;it. This means having a world-class maintenance mindset that requires nothing less than excellence in all facets of maintenance and the production of value for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does your company do all it can to consistently enable excellence within your maintenance organization? Do you have a world-class maintenance mindset? What do you do to maintain a culture that supports world-class maintenance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/avcxdt628NI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Contrasting Lean with Maintenance Best Practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations view improving their maintenance and reliability best practices as being distinct and separate from implementing lean initiatives. However, in reality a number of the processes involved in maintenance best practices incorporate the same principles as lean. This 3-minute video details the seven wastes in lean and how maintenance best practices can help you integrate lean concepts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>6 Welding Tips for Plant Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/9/10/4e7ef713-53bf-4f3d-a869-f9cf5097c369_welding-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 449px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Welding is a crucial part of a maintenance plan for many plants. Staying focused on the safety aspect of this skill will help ensure that employees and equipment stay safe at all times. Keep the following tips in mind when maintenance projects arise that require welding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Safety is the First Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All instruction manuals&amp;nbsp;should be read for any welding equipment that will be employed. Unless a particular piece of equipment is utilized on a regular basis, employees should take the time to go over how to properly use the welding equipment they have been assigned. This is especially critical if the equipment is new to the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Practice Makes Perfect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like almost any other skill, welding takes practice to fine-tune the right techniques. Make sure that employees who will be welding have the opportunity to practice their skills on a regular basis. This is just one reason why it is a good idea to have at least one person whose primary job is to weld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Check Credentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before anyone is assigned a welding job, it is imperative that his or her credentials are checked. Ideally, the employee should hold a welding degree&amp;nbsp;or certification from an accredited school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Gather Your Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Welding can be a dangerous job, hence the need for extensive training. In addition, it is essential for plant safety that the proper equipment is available for every welding job.&amp;nbsp;Specially designed welding gear&amp;nbsp;including gloves, clothing and helmets are necessary to protect welders from the extreme heat and sparks that are emitted by welding equipment. Keeping gear such as helmets clean and free of debris helps welders maintain a clear view of their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Prep Materials Before Welding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to make a clean weld, it is vital to prep the surfaces to be joined. This involves removing as much of the rust, dirt and debris as possible. If a solvent is needed to remove these elements, make certain that the surfaces are completely dry and free of solvent before any welding begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	6. Clear Space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While some tight spaces are to be expected (especially in the manufacturing industry), if possible dismantle parts that must be welded before moving them to a safe area. This step is necessary if the parts to be maintained are located close to gas lines or other sources of flammable materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/kksbUQIrLoc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>AAR to Build New Maintenance Facility at Illinois Airport</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AAR and the Greater Rockford Airport Authority (GRAA), in partnership with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, Sen. Dick Durbin, County Chairman Scott Christensen and Mayor Larry Morrissey, recently reached an agreement to build a new maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility on the grounds of the Chicago Rockford International Airport (RFD). The new hangar is expected to employ up to 500 people and will expand RFD&amp;#39;s current service offerings and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 200,000-square-foot facility is expected to operate 24 hours a day and will service next-generation, wide-body aircraft. This will allow for scheduled and unscheduled service, modification and overhaul, and all other support services for military and commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Final agreements between the partners are currently being developed, and construction is expected to begin within the year. The hangar will be located in the mid-field area of the airport and is slated to open in spring 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rockford joins AAR&amp;#39;s six other MRO locations in Duluth, Minn.; Oklahoma City; Miami; Lake Charles, La.; Indianapolis; and Hot Springs, Ark. The site was ultimately selected due to the region&amp;#39;s centralized location, cost effectiveness, availability of specialized technical talent and RFD development amenability. The region&amp;#39;s noted supply chain was also a strong factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a monumental economic and workforce development opportunity for RFD and the Rockford region,&amp;quot; said Mike Dunn, RFD executive director. &amp;quot;We look forward to welcoming AAR and are thankful for the collaboration and tireless dedication of Gov. Quinn, Sen. Durbin and all of the partners to make this a reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gov. Quinn announced a $15-million state investment to build the new maintenance facility. The investment comes through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) from Build Illinois bond funds. DCEO also will provide the company with a $600,000 investment toward training costs for its new employees.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Maintenance Tips for Heavy Machinery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/27/b71c7996-5912-4ede-a26c-1fedd1a3625a_GEN-0200061-D13.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 354px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Heavy-lifting and earthmoving machinery are the backbone of the mining, construction and agriculture industries around the world. These necessary and expensive pieces of equipment must be used to their most effective and efficient potential to perform such demanding labor. To ensure optimal performance of these costly pieces of industrial capital and the safety of their operators, regularly scheduled and preventive maintenance is a must. Following are some key tips to keep the gears grinding and pistons pumping in your own heavy-duty machines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Keep It Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just like the annual check-up with your physician, a regular check-up on the overall functionality and condition of your heavy machinery helps keep the continuity of what is expected and the standard performance of your equipment. Any non-scheduled emergency maintenance and repair jobs done on heavy machinery are typically fraught with human error and performed in a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that up to 20 percent of industrial accidents are related to maintenance operations, with 15 percent involving worker fatalities. By taking all the necessary preventative measures, not only are you ensuring the stated lifetime of your heavy machinery, but you&amp;#39;re also keeping operators safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My grandfather always said, &amp;quot;If everything works on your truck, that&amp;#39;s just an excuse for something to break.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s this philosophy of constantly checking and maintaining equipment, catching any minor problems before they evolve into bigger and more costly ones, that further drives the point to have regularly scheduled maintenance checks on your earthmoving machinery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Use the Right Tools for the Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Matching your equipment with the exact task that it&amp;#39;s intended to perform requires consideration of a number of variables, including terrain, material composition and elemental effects such as climate, etc. Likewise, it&amp;#39;s important to make certain that all attachments and performance accessories such as buckets and ploughs are made specific to your machine. With the safety of the crew operating this heavy and potentially dangerous equipment in mind, you simply cannot afford any guesswork here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Check and double-check all machinery and attachments before using them in the field. Your workers and your wallet will thank you.&amp;nbsp;When replacing parts, don&amp;rsquo;t assume the first ones you come across are the right ones for your machinery. Bearings, roller chains, gaskets, seals, etc., must all be the right quality and size and have the correct load-bearing qualities for your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Don&amp;#39;t Overwork Your Machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Never exceed your equipment&amp;#39;s stated performance specifications and limitations as found in your owner/operator manual. As with any industry where heavy equipment is a staple of operation, effectiveness and efficiency are key to optimal performance and yielding the best results for your efforts. Knowing and abiding by weight limits for loads and inclines for transit are an easy way to keep your heavy machinery working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most modern heavy machines come programmed with multiple power modes. It&amp;#39;s essential for operators to make sure their equipment is set to the correct power mode for the task at hand. Also, minimizing your machinery&amp;rsquo;s travel and idle time can add longevity to the life of your assets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Put Your Toys Away&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While performing regular maintenance checks is an active way of preventing damage to your equipment, properly storing your heavy machinery is another necessary, yet more passive method of ensuring optimal and safe performance. All large machinery should be kept in covered, moisture-free storage with environment control if necessary. This will help save your equipment safe from the dangers of water, which can lead to rust and corrosion, as well as from the harshness of direct sunlight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Knowledge is Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your machinery is only as useful as the men and women working with it. For upholding the highest standards of operations while minimizing risk, everyone in contact with the equipment should be trained and familiar with the proper use of each piece of machinery on the job. For some machines, simple hands-on instruction is sufficient, while others may require special certifications before operating the machinery. Follow your owner/ operator manual and any other official guidelines pertaining to your specific industry, job type and equipment model before letting just anyone take your backhoe for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/jhZ68yjKWmM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Survey Finds Lack of Communication, Planning Among Manufacturers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lack of planning and tracking of inventory, poor communications among company divisions, and underutilized or non-existent technology are among the core elements holding back manufacturers, educational and medical institutions, life sciences companies, food processors, automotive makers and facility maintenance companies, according to a recent survey by Storeroom Solutions Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The extensive survey was conducted over nine months with input from diverse industries and personnel in companies ranging in size from less than 100 employees to more than 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than half of those surveyed indicated the state of their maintenance, repair and operations (MRO)/indirect materials storeroom frequently causes reliability issues or downtime at their plants. The survey also found that little to no communication exists between the storeroom, purchasing and the rest of the company. In addition, most companies surveyed don&amp;#39;t have the visibility across the supply chain to see how their inventory is moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In the U.S. alone, more than $500 billion annually is spent on MRO spare parts and services,&amp;quot; said Michael Weinberg, vice president of sales and marketing for Storeroom Solutions. &amp;quot;A tremendous amount of time and resources are consumed managing that spending in order to maintain production reliability and maintenance effectiveness. This survey confirmed much of what we already knew about how companies are managing MRO and exposed some new trends as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>University of Kansas Offers Maintenance Management Online Certificate Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance managers looking for extra training can learn new skills to advance their careers through the University of Kansas Continuing Education&amp;#39;s maintenance management online certificate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courses are instructed by Joel Levitt, a leading maintenance management trainer and director of international projects for Life Cycle Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Levitt, the maintenance profession faces workforce shortages and the loss of institutional memory and experience as Baby Boomers retire in greater numbers each year. New employees move into vacated roles lacking these important attributes, which reduces the effectiveness of maintenance management programs often with problematic results for organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Successful organizations will be ruthless about training personnel in skill sets deemed essential for the success of the enterprise,&amp;quot; Levitt says. &amp;quot;Our mission is to stop whining about the good old days, get out of our offices and download the mission-critical skills from the maintenance masters still around.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three of Levitt&amp;#39;s books,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Introduction to Maintenance Management, Planning and Scheduling Maintenance Activity,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Preventive and Predictive Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;, form the basis for the maintenance management certificate program curriculum. The program uses a live online format that eliminates travel concerns while providing flexible study time, a self-determined work pace and one-on-one interaction with Levitt through email and online access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next maintenance management online certificate course begins Sept. 23, 2014.

            <title>5 Tips for Large Machinery Maintenance </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/26/b74e9f0b-3d2e-48f2-947c-2c3bad8f74b0_machinery-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 340px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Preventive and regularly scheduled maintenance is vital to the efficiency and life of large machinery. Heavy machinery makes it possible for traditional industries to operate on a large scale. Mining and agriculture are among the global industries that could not exist in today&amp;#39;s world at the scale they do without the use of large machinery to support their operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Benefits of Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance preserves the value of the equipment. Keeping machines in good working order extends equipment life and keeps operators safe. It also ensures the availability of the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Early detection of problems allows repairs to be made before the situation worsens. Machinery that does not need to be taken offline for extensive repairs will avoid production interruptions. Regular inspections and analysis can be used to predict and prevent component failures that may create safety hazards and machinery breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Good maintenance is important for worker safety. Large machinery maintenance can be dangerous. It is often conducted in close contact with running machinery. The conditions can be closely confined and unhealthy. The work is non-routine and subject to human error. There is often time pressure involved as well. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that 15 to 20 percent of industrial accidents and 10 to 15 percent of all fatal industrial accidents are related to maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Preventive maintenance and scheduled equipment overhauls can diminish the chances of large machinery breakdown and thus lessen the risks that technicians face in onsite repairs. Accidents in the workplace are also significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are five tips for large machinery maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. Keep Daily Records of Use and Oversee Operation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Large machinery wear and breakdown are often made worse by unskilled handling. Keeping records of machinery use and monitoring daily operations can help pinpoint when and where the machinery is being used by inadequately skilled operators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new way to oversee the operations of large machinery is via GPS. The device tracks movement and records it in digital records, which are organized to be easily retrieved. Problems can be caught early, and breakdowns can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Maintain a Schedule of Planned Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Components break down, and wear is inevitable. Establish forecasts for the expected life of all components and replace them on schedule. Part replacement must be done by knowledgeable technicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bearings are key components of heavy machinery equipment and can be easily damaged or worn. Bearing housings should be regularly maintained, including inspection for corrosion and wear, and replaced when necessary. A maintenance log should also be kept to ensure regular checks are not missed and compliance is measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Lubricate and Clean Frequently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working heavy machinery requires daily maintenance. Some components, especially moving parts in engines and power trains, demand frequent lubrication. Other components, such as hydraulic lifts and bearings, must be monitored and lubricated at the first sign of need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contamination can lead to machinery breakdown. Water is a major source of corrosion. Lubrication prevents corrosion. Maintaining seals and replacing filters will help keep lubricants free of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. Inspect and Monitor Components for Wear and Damage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A planned maintenance schedule can predict component wear. Visually inspect components on an ongoing basis to monitor wear and prevent equipment failure. Components that must be replaced ahead of schedule may signal a larger problem that needs to be diagnosed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Check belts, pulleys and chains for alignment and condition. Inspect gears and sprockets for broken teeth, cracks and misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fluid analysis should also be part of a regular maintenance schedule. Analysis of used lubricants and other fluids is an excellent way to diagnose problems and prevent machinery wear and breakdown. Identifying contaminants in the fluids can lead analysts to the source of wear and damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. Protect Equipment During Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Large machinery should be stored under cover whenever possible. Motors, turbines, mixers and other equipment should be rotated frequently. Inspect idle machinery for rust, condensation and contamination. Don&amp;#39;t forget to check all lubricants. Oil-mist lubrication is a good solution for the damaging effects of warm, humid environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Enhance Profits through Industrial Asset Management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in a broad range of industries, from aviation and power generation equipment to oil and gas equipment suppliers, can enhance profits, carve a highly defensible niche in their markets and retain customers longer through world-class industrial asset management (IAM). The existing operating models, however, face two structural challenges: limited machine-to-machine coverage and suboptimal data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Limited remote equipment connectivity results in inaccurate installed base (IB) data that hinders service opportunity assessment and can compromise up to 20 percent of services revenues. Margins are then reduced because of the increased service delivery cost (as much as 25 percent) in the absence of remote machinery diagnostics. Unscheduled asset downtime impacts the end-customer&amp;#39;s profitability and consequently their satisfaction, resulting in damage to the OEM&amp;#39;s client relationship and ultimately its product range&amp;#39;s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In aftermarket service contracts, inaccurate failure forecasting and the associated costs lead to inadequate pricing. In service operations, the first-time fix rate by service technicians also suffers because of lack of proper triage, spare parts availability and poor service scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantifying and proactively managing contract risk is essential but often not done properly. Poor reliability due to not implementing the necessary engineering design changes results in higher maintenance and quality costs, which impacts service margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 shows how a poor operating model can potentially lead to the loss of 10 to 15 percent of revenues and 15 to 20 percent of profits for new and existing service contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/12/f053a323-24c3-4588-9127-7c86c7e20347_figure 1b.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A typical $1-billion service business leaves $80 to $100 million in missed revenues on the table along with $10 to $15 million in lost profits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Upside Potential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is clear that aftermarket services linked to remote diagnostic devices will see significant growth in the next five to 10 years. OEMs looking for a new profit center can grow with that demand. Based on projected demand for machine-to-machine technology, Harbor Research estimates that total value-added service revenue has the potential to grow from more than $50 billion in 2010 to $204 billion by 2014, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 32 percent. The research points to asset management, supply logistics and energy management as major drivers of this market expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two prominent examples confirm these trends. GE&amp;#39;s sales of product-related services were about 30 percent of its $43.4 billion in revenue in 2012. That was up 4 percent over the previous year. However, GE&amp;#39;s operating profit of $12.5 billion was a 6-percent increase over the year before. Rolls Royce&amp;#39;s innovative business and operating model, called TotalCare service, is a lease and maintenance contract for each engine sold. The model&amp;#39;s success can be seen in sales that have doubled in the last five years, with more than half of those revenues and about 70 percent of its profits coming from the TotalCare service business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies such as GE and Rolls Royce deliver exceptional profits and revenues thanks to an operating model fulfilling key business imperatives of &amp;quot;improvement in asset uptime&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;extending asset longevity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the financial appeal, transforming service operations often becomes a part of the CEO&amp;#39;s agenda, but many OEMs don&amp;#39;t possess the specialized knowledge and expertise to tackle the related operational and organizational issues. These issues mainly involve strategies for driving service revenue and methodologies for optimizing service costs. A failure to grasp and resolve these issues is an important reason why service-oriented companies are struggling with developing their best operating models. Experience shows three main components of existing operating model deficiencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Fragmented Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Existing operating models are frequently inadequate because of imperfect or non-existent links along the service operations chain. From setup and planning through contract management, the full range of service execution support, including transaction processing and reporting, is highly fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Setup and planning suffer from limited visibility in the existing database. Information on the customer, repair history and equipment is difficult to track due to large numbers, geographic dispersion, reselling and unconsolidated customer lists. An outdated database naturally affects the service opportunity assessment and results in non-profitable service contract pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment diagnosis process is ineffective if real-time equipment condition monitoring is done in a selective manner. Real-time condition monitoring can enable better diagnosis at the initial call level, improved availability of spare parts and tools for field visits, more intelligent field-service operations, and improved training for technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In essence, absence of real-time condition monitoring does not fulfill the &amp;quot;first-time fix&amp;quot; demands of customers, leading to low customer satisfaction. Aberdeen Field Service 2013 research shows abysmally low customer retention rates for OEMs that have a first-time fix rate of less than 80 percent. The net result is that the company is unable to develop a profitable function with service excellence that creates customer confidence and positive brand recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Insufficient Technology and Disjointed Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with machine-to-machine monitoring and other technologies, legacy field-service platforms are generally among the more disjointed service systems and frequently are incapable of providing an integrated operational view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/12/92667bbc-3fa7-4091-a35d-751b875c6136_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 579px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Explosive growth in the number of connected devices will pose a challenge if machine-to-machine monitoring is inadequate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a study of 156 companies providing field service to customers, the Aberdeen Research Group looked closely at the role of automation. The best-in-class performers were those investing in up-to-date automation technology&amp;mdash;automating or overhauling their processes for areas such as enterprise resource planning, improved billing and other financial record-keeping, customer relationship management, parts management, and workforce management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Aberdeen determined that to achieve best-in-class field-service performance, companies must integrate parts management into scheduling criteria, schedule service tasks more frequently and in a centralized manner, empower field agents with mobile tools and devices with real-time access to information, develop dynamic service resource plans, and use performance management tools to tweak resource plans, schedule parameters and workforce management processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Critical Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Resources for remote monitoring design and connectivity monitoring can be hard to find. Critical resources include senior field-service executives who help select the right machines and the operational parameters, software experts to design and support the deployment, shared services experts to set up the remote operations center, and skills ranging from basic parameter monitoring to high-end functional knowledge and equipment expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bringing these experts together for various types of equipment across different geographic regions is a complex job. A well-designed IAM operating model helps to ensure consistent, timely and effective service delivery at an optimal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To balance customization and speed, the IAM operating model should be configured according to an individual business model over a standard IAM framework that leverages best practices and industry standards. This IAM framework straddles the three key elements: smart processes, focused technology and the right people. These can be delivered through the industrial asset management portfolio shown in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/12/537b53a6-bc1f-4a93-8ff9-b3d9a74edb25_figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 380px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. An industrial asset management portfolio can deliver on business imperatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial asset management offers a unique approach that combines specialized consulting, technology and data analysis. It includes machine-to-machine design and deployment support, effective remote monitoring for select machines, robust data management, prognostics for effective asset health management, and in-depth data analysis across the service life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OEMs can benefit by leveraging industrial asset management capabilities to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Grow service revenue by 15 to 20 percent through increased base coverage (up to 100 percent)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve service contract profitability by up to 10 to 15 percent through right pricing and accurate contract risk forecasting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce overall service by 8 to 10 percent through remote diagnostics and planned service scheduling while decreasing service fulfillment costs by up to 15 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase customer asset uptime by 10 to 15 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/12/bf3be909-3863-4ba5-82ec-86a3930c1e75_figure 4.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 456px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. This example shows a steady-state operating model for best-in-class industrial asset management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A mature IAM framework clearly delineates the roles and activities of the main stakeholders: the OEM, the technology partner and the IAM service provider. The right operating model also helps cover the non-core tasks efficiently through scalable resourcing and supports the focus of OEM teams on effectiveness decisions through data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/CvGRNwAR58w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>AMP Launches Asset Management Study</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Following the release of the ISO 55000 series of standards focusing on asset management, the Association for Maintenance Professionals (AMP) has launched a new asset management study to reveal insights into current and future asset management practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The organization is seeking input from 1,000 reliability leaders for the study, which is designed to provide a 1- to 5-year look at asset management practices, investment priorities and challenges being faced by asset owners and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Participation in the 30-question survey is estimated to take only 10 to 15 minutes. While individuals may participate anonymously, all respondents must complete industry demographic information to assist in the gathering of useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information will be collected only to reveal insights and trends. No individual information or organizations will be identified in the resulting reports. Participants may choose to identify themselves in order to receive a free copy of the summary report that will be issued, but contact information will not be sold, traded or shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To participate in the asset management study, click &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/iso55000"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>United Opens New Maintenance Facility at Newark Airport</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	United Airlines recently unveiled a new aircraft maintenance hangar at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, N.J. United invested $35 million to construct the facility, which will help support the airline&amp;#39;s wide-body aircraft, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350-XWB, which United will begin flying in 2018. The hangar also expands the airline&amp;#39;s maintenance capability for wide-bodies by 33 percent at Newark Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This state-of-the-art hangar underscores United&amp;#39;s commitment to the city of Newark, the state of New Jersey and the region,&amp;quot; said Ken Burtt, United&amp;#39;s senior vice president of technical operations. &amp;quot;The facility will be an asset to our operation, helping us improve the reliability of our aircraft, maintain the highest levels of safety and provide a superior workplace for our employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	United has more than 13,000 employees in the New York metropolitan area, 700 of whom are dedicated to technical operations and maintenance at Newark Liberty. Construction of the 90,000-square-foot hangar also had a significant economic impact on the region, as more than 600 local workers helped build the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;United Airlines&amp;#39; investment of nearly $35 million in its new 21st century hangar at Newark Liberty International Airport is further evidence of the carrier&amp;#39;s longstanding commitment to New Jersey,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; said Deb Gramiccioni, Port Authority deputy executive director. &amp;quot;The Port Authority is especially pleased this wide-body aircraft hangar is designed to serve larger aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, one of the newer generation of planes for our passengers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In November 2013, United also completed construction of a 125,000-square-foot maintenance hangar at Washington Dulles International Airport. Together with this new hangar at Newark, United has significantly increased its maintenance capabilities on the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Life Cycle Engineering to Offer Asset Management Workshops </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) recently announced that it will offer three workshops on the international standard for asset management (ISO 55000). The workshops will be offered through LCE&amp;rsquo;s training entity, the Life Cycle Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISO 55000 workshops will educate leaders and the workforce on how to align business objectives with a risk-based asset management strategy and implementation plan to maximize value to the organization. The workshops will also enable executives and managers to lead asset management activities through hands-on ISO 55000 planning activities specific to each organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISO 55000 for Leaders: Developing the Asset Management Policy workshop is a privately held session customized for individual organizations. The half-day workshop will teach leadership teams the most important attributes of the ISO 55000 standard, the potential impact of standards compliance on organizational goals and leadership&amp;rsquo;s role in realizing maximum potential. Leaders will create an asset management policy, guiding principles, decision-making criteria, reporting, continuous improvement requirements and plan for communication, all unique for each organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISO 55000 for Managers: Developing the Strategic Asset Management Plan workshop is designed to be delivered in conjunction with the ISO 55000 for Leaders workshop. The two-day private workshop will build on the organization-specific asset management policy developed in the leadership workshop. The workshop is ideal for an organization&amp;rsquo;s operations, maintenance and reliability managers. Participants will create a strategic asset management plan (SAMP) and outline the implementation plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISO 55000: Creating an ISO 55000 Implementation Plan is a two-day public workshop for professionals working in operations and charged with leading the ISO 55000 planning and implementation. The workshop is ideal for maintenance managers, reliability engineers and quality assurance professionals. Participants will design and develop a strategic asset management plan based on the components outlined in ISO 55000 guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Value of an asset is defined by how much it contributes to the achievement of organizational goals,&amp;quot; said Bill Wilder, director of the Life Cycle Institute. &amp;quot;Our workshops are designed to help our clients optimize asset value and decrease organizational risks through a comprehensive asset management strategy that is built around business objectives and goals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Risks of Cutting Maintenance Costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/15/701545af-7ff1-4f02-b2b7-20bcc31b4bb7_maintenance-costs.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our competitive environment, every manufacturer struggles to do more with less and to find capital for &amp;quot;nonproduction&amp;quot; areas, such as maintenance, safety, training, housekeeping and human resources. If done in a short-sighted fashion, the employer learns through painful experience the sacred law of &amp;quot;unintended consequences.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent magazine article detailed the harm to production and profits that resulted from gradually shifting almost all maintenance functions to production employees. You&amp;#39;re probably thinking, &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t do that,&amp;quot; but many employers have eliminated certain housekeeping workers and relied upon production employees to clean up their area or machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let me share some of my experiences where &amp;quot;nonproduction&amp;quot; functions were neglected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At one company, management of change (MOC) was overlooked as conveyors were modified and used machines and lines were added. Overstretched plant engineering and maintenance departments missed the new point of operation and other areas requiring guarding. Interlocks were not connected. Holes were left in boxes and panels. Lockout training was not updated. No annual evaluation of lockout was connected, and training was not revised. After an injured line employee complained to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency issued hundreds of thousands of dollars in citations and penalties relating to guarding, lockout, training and electrical violations. Even worse, the company has significant &amp;quot;repeat&amp;quot; citation OSHA exposure throughout its many plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At another plant, the overall safety responsibility was shifted to a production supervisor (or maintenance or lab director, etc.), and the plant safety manager was laid off. The supervisor/safety manager responded to the loudest voice (the production manager) and the seemingly most urgent matters (getting product out the door). A worker was killed but not &amp;quot;directly&amp;quot; because of safety lapses (a poor safety culture was a factor), and OSHA learned that new hires had not received proper training. Written policies looked good until the company terminated the safety manager, so the decline in compliance was even more glaring. The poor pseudo safety manager was so underwater that he never acted on the recommendations from the last three yearly audits by the insurer, so OSHA cited the employer for numerous willful citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A third company didn&amp;#39;t feel that it could retain additional experts and relied on its own staff and its general mechanical contractors to select and install new food production lines. These individuals were actually solid people, but they did not have experience with the process hazard analysis (PHA) experience in selecting and operating lines with combustible dust issues. After several hundred thousand dollars in OSHA citations and retrofitting costs, the organization now wishes it had spent the money on a full-time safety manager and used a consulting engineer with combustible dust experience to address system design and management of change issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are safety and engineering-related &amp;quot;unintended consequences.&amp;quot; Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I embrace the lean movement and realize that sometimes you have to select the &amp;quot;least bad option,&amp;quot; but you must also think ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Kr_mwAYtjiY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>United Opens Maintenance Hangar at Washington Dulles Airport</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	United Airlines recently opened its new wide-body aircraft maintenance hangar at the Washington Dulles International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The airline invested nearly $45 million to construct the facility, which will enable the airline to perform maintenance on two wide-body or several narrow-body aircraft simultaneously. United employs approximately 300 technical operations employees at Dulles and has nearly 6,000 employees throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The close relationship between Dulles and United goes back decades, and this facility represents yet another important investment in this key market,&amp;quot; said Greg Hart, United&amp;#39;s senior vice president for technical operations. &amp;quot;Our new maintenance hangar, coupled with additional improvements in our terminals, gate areas, lounges and employee facilities, will deliver greater reliability for our customers and enhance their overall travel experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than 600 area construction workers helped build the 125,000-square-foot hangar, which includes 85,000 square feet of enclosed aircraft space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The opening of United&amp;#39;s new state-of-the-art maintenance hangar further solidifies Dulles International&amp;#39;s position as a world-class hub for aviation,&amp;quot; said Jack Potter, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. &amp;quot;This hangar is a significant investment in the airport and the region, and it will support smooth, efficient travel for the more than 14 million United passengers who fly through Dulles each year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	United also has maintenance hangars at its hubs in Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and is nearing completion on another wide-body hangar at Newark Liberty International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SMRP Releases Revised Metrics</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP) recently launched more than 70 new standardized industry metrics designed to provide insight into the effectiveness and accuracy of asset management in the maintenance and reliability industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The revisions give maintenance and reliability professionals the ability to uncover best-in-class target values where applicable as well as understanding into formulas, ratios, statistics, definitions and references for a consistent benchmark to measure their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While current SMRP metrics offer guidance on how to measure key performance indicators, the newly added best-in-class target values explain how to effectively apply the metrics and identify &amp;quot;what good looks like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These metrics allow organizations to measurably improve their effectiveness within their respective fields,&amp;quot; said Shon Isenhour, SMRP chair and director of education at GPAllied. &amp;quot;We are proud to facilitate an industry tool that many companies can use to examine critical internal data that will further promote the growth of our industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SMRP also added a new search feature for e-Metrics called &amp;quot;bundles&amp;quot; to help the maintenance and reliability professional quickly find key work management metrics. Bundles are summarized as work identification metrics, work planning metrics, work scheduling metrics, backlog management metrics, resource management of people and resource management of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Automating Maintenance Tasks with CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/7/17/3e1bfe15-2f5d-40f3-9723-633fc7adf5c6_Blend Tanks-small.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 233px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;The boiler at the Tulco Oils plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has never gone out of service &amp;ndash; and the company wants to keep it that way. That&amp;rsquo;s why this midsized manufacturer of industrial lubricants invested in a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) when it embarked on a multimillion-dollar expansion project that added 15,000 square feet to its main plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tulco Oils chose Bigfoot CMMS, produced by Smartware Group Inc., to automate maintenance tasks for the new machinery installed during the plant&amp;rsquo;s expansion, including seven new blending tanks, 50 pumps and an air-compression system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With the increase in the number of key components in the expanded plant, we needed a CMMS for work orders and preventive maintenance (PM) management to schedule ongoing maintenance and downtime,&amp;quot; said Don Stanton, Tulco Oils&amp;rsquo; vice president of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the expansion, the company also had to automate maintenance processes for the plant&amp;rsquo;s existing gas, air, boiler and steam systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We added a load to those systems that made it even more critical for every piece of equipment to be well-maintained,&amp;quot; Stanton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a designed lubricant manufacturer, Tulco Oils custom blends a broad array of hydraulic and gear oils, transformer oils, turbine oils and cutting fluids used to build equipment sold to original equipment manufacturers &amp;ndash; from tractors that plow Midwestern farms to machines that produce consumer goods in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, it can take from three to seven days for Tulco Oils to fill orders and deliver its products to customers. However, some local customers have sent out emergency calls for help in one afternoon and taken delivery of lubricants the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Often we have to respond to a customer&amp;rsquo;s emergency,&amp;quot; Stanton said. &amp;quot;If a customer has a failed piece of equipment and comes to us with an urgent need to get the oil to repair the broken product, we respond immediately. The giant brands make no such claims about these quick turnarounds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When expanding its plant, the company used the opportunity to redesign its maintenance operations and configure the CMMS program to fit its specific needs. Instead of using a standard-issue database template, the Tulco Oils team worked with Smartware Group to design an equipment database that matched the company&amp;rsquo;s asset-management needs and captured the most relevant information for the industrial lubricant market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t have off-the-shelf products,&amp;quot; Stanton noted. &amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t stock products because it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep on hand all the different combinations specified by our customers. We custom blend our oils and lubricants for specific orders.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because quick turnaround time is the linchpin of the company&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantage, Stanton underscored the importance of keeping equipment at Tulco Oils&amp;rsquo; expanded plant in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;If a boiler were to go down, it would kill our ability to blend products,&amp;quot; Stanton said. &amp;quot;The same goes for the air compressor. We have an air dryer on the system because oil and water do not mix, so the air must remain dry. We have to make sure these pieces of machinery work every single day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to adopting the CMMS program, staff members kept a paper trail to track service calls and maintenance tasks for its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We didn&amp;rsquo;t operate off of memory, but we used lots of handwritten records and logs,&amp;quot; Stanton recalled. &amp;quot;The more machinery we added, the more impossible it became to manage. We needed a better method for creating preventive maintenance schedules.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, thanks to the new CMMS, the operations team at Tulco Oils no longer relies on handwritten work orders. Instead, the CMMS automatically produces email reminders that go to whoever is responsible for the maintenance task &amp;ndash; whether that person is a technician on staff or an outside vendor. The system is also designed to avoid email spam to make the process even more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;One big benefit we&amp;rsquo;re getting from our CMMS system is better communication about maintenance,&amp;quot; Stanton added. &amp;quot;When a piece of equipment is not operational, we can tap in and create a work order without having to run someone down or spend time trying to contact someone by phone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also used the CMMS to set up a non-asset PM calendar, including occupational and environmental safety checks, such as for water contamination analysis and prevention, as well as other municipal safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an expanded plant and increased capabilities provided by its CMMS, Stanton foresees his company gaining even more clout in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Now we can run circles around our competitors,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Tnavmw6Cweo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Make Maintenance More Efficient with Equipment Bills of Materials</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) have the ability to create bills of materials (BOMs) for equipment or assets. These would include the components needed for a piece of equipment. All types of asset-intensive industries, from oil drilling and automotive manufacturing to food and pharmaceutical manufacturing, can benefit from equipment or asset BOMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps, like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced life without BOMs. To find parts, you either had to use cheat sheets or refer to drawings from the machine builder in order to find a manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s part number. I can recall being called out of bed in the middle of the night when a piece of equipment was down and the spare part could not be located because the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s part number could not be found. You had to look in drawings, schematics and catalogs to find a part number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early days, not everyone had access to the documentation, especially the nightshift. Everyone had their own lists, which varied from person to person. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure these personal lists were ever updated, but we all lived by them. There was always a go-to guy when you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a part. &amp;quot;Go see Johnny. I&amp;rsquo;m sure he has the correct part number.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How can good equipment BOMs increase the efficiency of your maintenance program? They can help the maintenance planner plan a task or job faster. Planners do not have to spend time looking in drawings, manuals or catalogs to find part numbers that could be right at their fingertips. BOMs can be created for certain preventive maintenance tasks, shutdowns or redundant tasks. Of course, it takes time to create good equipment BOMs. There is also some responsibility for maintaining them. If BOMs are not maintained correctly, this creates confusion and wastes time for all end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment BOMs can also help reduce downtime. Do you have craftsmen working on backshifts, weekends or nights? Having equipment BOMs will reduce equipment downtime because the right parts can be identified and procured quickly, even in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using a good BOM system can help manage system sub-components. Do you have sub-components with replacement parts that are hard to identify? For example, you may have a conveyor that uses lifts, curves, different length belts or widths, gearboxes with motors, or a hoist that is made of several components. These sub-component items can be broken out into their own BOMs and be part of a sub-BOM for a conveyor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have created BOMs for a process like injection molding. Although there were more than 20 different mold types, it was easy to set up a BOM for each type. The technician could check the storeroom&amp;rsquo;s balances, see what was out for repair and what was coming in, as well as the minimum and maximum balances.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, equipment BOMs help manage your spare-parts inventory. When a piece of equipment or asset is decommissioned and removed from the shop floor, the associated spare parts can sit in the storeroom for years, taking up valuable space. With equipment BOMs, the task of identifying which spare parts belonged to the decommissioned piece of equipment is a simple task. All that&amp;rsquo;s required is a little cross-checking to ensure the parts are not used on some other equipment along with removing the items from the CMMS and the storeroom. This helps reduce the total dollar amount of your spare-parts inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All types of industries can benefit from using equipment BOMs. While time and effort will be required to create and maintain them, you no longer will be wasting time looking for part numbers in drawings, catalogs and schematics. Once BOMs have been set up correctly and everyone knows how to access them, you will have a lot fewer headaches and less equipment downtime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ba5Ac-vT4UI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Bombardier Announces New Aircraft Maintenance Plan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Bombardier Aerospace recently announced a new maintenance plan that targets CSeries aircraft line maintenance checks at intervals of 850 flight hours and base maintenance checks at intervals of 8,500 flight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proposed maintenance plan will allow operators of CSeries aircraft to benefit from minimized downtime and more competitive maintenance costs, all while ensuring the inherent safety and reliability of the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bombardier has been developing a maintenance program for the CSeries aircraft since October 2010. Throughout the design evolution phase, the company determined that line maintenance and base maintenance task intervals could be achieved at or in excess of 850 and 8,500 flight hours, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These proposed intervals will provide our operators with a leading maintenance program for the CSeries aircraft,&amp;quot; said Bombardier vice president Todd Young. &amp;quot;We believe that this offers further evidence of our commitment to provide competitive maintenance cost solutions for CSeries aircraft operators.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to the airliner&amp;#39;s entry into service in 2014, the maintenance program for the CSeries aircraft will remain under development, with multiple working group and industry steering committee meetings before the maintenance review board report is submitted to authorities for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>4 Essentials for Reliability Excellence</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this 6-minute, 19-second video, Bill Wilder of the Life Cycle Institute describes the four competencies required to achieve reliability excellence. Understand how to build the business case, why it is important to apply the science of change management, what kinds of metrics are driving the results and behavior you seek, and why you should be looking constantly at the processes and technologies that are available in the marketplace to see what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t working. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Reliability as a Service</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The success of condition-based maintenance programs depends on the ability to drive collaboration among users and experts, and distribute results to decision-makers while having a dependable infrastructure to ensure security, reliability and flexibility. Cloud-based business infrastructures like software as a service (SaaS) can play a significant role, making it easier to share information and support a stable, actionable and sustainable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While cloud computing is sweeping through enterprises for just about every application, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance (PdM) are no different. In fact, the PdM industry potentially stands to gain more from the cloud revolution than most any other industry. To date, PdM systems have been primarily isolated to individual laptop and desktop computers. PdM was completely left behind in the client-server boom of the 1990s. By moving to the cloud, PdM systems are gaining the advantages associated with the cloud, including cost savings, accessibility, collaboration and productivity. Enter reliability as a service (RaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RaaS is a solution that utilizes the broad reaches of cloud-based resources to give more insight into the necessary tasks of the people responsible for plant performance, safety and operations. Whether this includes giving certified analysts access to data to allow for collaboration on fault diagnosis, gaining second opinions from analytics experts, tracking events from fault diagnosis through repair process or relaying risk assessment and business metrics to management, RaaS overcomes collaboration obstacles associated with resource accessibility and driving communications across key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	RaaS Adoption Made Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To encourage greater adoption, RaaS models allow plants to license an application for use as a service on-demand through a subscription model rather than purchasing hardware and software to run stand-alone applications. In the RaaS model, plants need only a computer or a server to download an application and Internet access to run the software to take full advantage of centralized data management, power and security infrastructures coupled with collaboration tools and direct access to certified PdM experts. Despite being a relatively new term to the industry, plant management and reliability and maintenance professionals need to familiarize themselves with RaaS, as it enhances operational efficiencies, improves safety, keeps PdM programs and technology current and drives return on investment (ROI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The catalyst behind plants&amp;rsquo; increasing interest in RaaS is the reduction of capital costs while assuring access to the latest technology. This provides a level of service that delivers reliable information and analysis with universal accessibility to information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. RaaS technology enables the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; business culture and removes the responsibility of implementing and maintaining an information technology (IT) infrastructure, which requires hardware investments beyond traditional data-collection hardware, software licensing, support and training costs. Rather than spending time managing an IT network &amp;ndash; a function plant personnel are not specialized to handle &amp;ndash; RaaS frees maintenance professionals to focus on reaching their reliability and uptime goals without the distraction of IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Collaboration and Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though RaaS has considerable cost benefits, plants that rely on the cloud solely for that reason are not reaping the full benefits of the technology. The first and most important reason plants should evaluate RaaS is because it enables managers and employees to collaborate and share the results of their maintenance and reliability efforts in real time. Instead of sharing information among a small group in the maintenance or engineering department, machine condition health information can be accessed by all stakeholders, including external experts in the enterprise or local plant at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With greater transparency, the condition-monitoring program becomes synchronous with improving operations that are essential to plant availability and uptime goals. RaaS is accessible to personnel from operations, management, maintenance and engineering who are then in a position to make informed decisions that affect plant production and outage planning. This ensures the plant runs smoothly and managers outside the condition-monitoring program always have the most current machine condition information and, as a result, the knowledge to make well-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, ACME Industrial Services is an integrated plant reliability maintenance company that uses RaaS to centralize all of its field engineers who are stationed all over the world. ACME&amp;rsquo;s central facility in India is fully integrated with the field engineers by using a predictive maintenance RaaS solution hosted by Azima DLI in Tukwila, Wash. At the central facility, engineers provide machine condition analysis support, and the results are published within the cloud. Customers can then view detailed condition information for their machines within their local plants rather than relying on spreadsheets delivered by email or other analog channels. In this example, the cloud provides an infrastructure that allows the Indian services company to streamline its workflow and better serve its clients from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Jumping into the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overcoming the fears of even the most risk-averse IT professionals, cloud computing has proven to be a secure and effective technology. With the right education and experienced partner, a plant can easily become more comfortable about the safety, security and reliability of its data in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The keys to alleviating cloud fears are to evaluate the potential RaaS partner&amp;rsquo;s network and security model and see how well it maps to the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. The customer&amp;rsquo;s IT department should be directly involved in these discussions from the start. The IT department will partner with plant personnel to develop a specific set of criteria to evaluate the RaaS offering within the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. Following are some questions that can be helpful to ask when evaluating a cloud service provider&amp;rsquo;s model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do you clearly understand how the cloud computing offering works from the RaaS vendor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor meet the IT security model of your plant?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does your plant have the delegated ability to control access to their system?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will your plant have clear lines of communication with the vendor for sales and technical support needs?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor have a structured change management and patch management process?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Can I obtain a copy of my data if I need to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How accessible and knowledgeable is technical support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Admittedly, RaaS is still at nascent stages of adoption for predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring initiatives, so it&amp;rsquo;s recommended that plants &amp;quot;do their homework&amp;quot; and implement a thorough evaluation of a potential partner. Customer support, uptime and security protocols should be at the forefront of discussions when evaluating vendors, especially if this is the first foray into the cloud. A good RaaS partner is critical, as it will be the key in helping achieve the performance and budget goals that will catch the eye of senior management and keep predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring programs running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Reduce Costs with MRO Data Cleansing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As competition and technology continue to evolve in today&amp;rsquo;s industrial and manufacturing industries, companies are faced with the ever-increasing challenge of reducing costs and improving efficiency while maintaining production quality. These manufacturing companies often have multiple sites spread across large geographic regions, each with thousands of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) spare parts on hand to keep operations running. In such large organizations, several different employees enter items into various enterprise asset management (EAM) systems at each site, with little or no standard guidelines, and often in multiple languages. Over time, this lack of standardization causes materials data to become inconsistent and inaccurate, resulting in many negative effects that can be felt throughout all units of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most common effects caused by corrupt materials data include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unidentifiable items&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Duplication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		False stock-outs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inefficient part searches&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased maverick purchases (direct buys)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Limited benefits from EAM systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These inefficiencies can cost companies significant time and money, while preventing them from making critical data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Data-Cleansing Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to transform corrupt data into consistent quality data, a data-cleansing process must be implemented to create one common corporate catalog that can be maintained throughout the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the data-cleansing process may appear very simple in nature, it requires a very unique and specialized set of software, people and procedures. Some data-cleansing companies pride themselves on efficiency and speed through the use of automated software, but in reality, there is no software application that can accurately cleanse mass data files without human intervention. The data-cleansing process is actually much more detailed, and for the most accurate results, requires the use of automated software applications combined with the involvement of cleansing specialists to ensure consistency, accuracy and efficiency. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To illustrate the data-cleansing process from start to finish, it has been broken down into nine steps. While every project is different based on specific customer requirements, these nine steps cover the standard procedures involved in every data-cleansing project. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 1 &amp;ndash; Segregate and Standardize the Manufacturer Name and Part Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using automated software, the manufacturer name and part number are extracted and segregated from the unstructured free text description. Once segregated, the manufacturer name and part number are corrected and standardized, ensuring each unique manufacturer name and part number maintains one consistent structure throughout the entire database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/40bd5ebe-775e-4bcf-b3f8-61c255c76f6a_Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 640px; height: 197px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 2 &amp;ndash; Assign Noun-Modifier and Required Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following the segregation and standardization of manufacturer names and part numbers, a noun-modifier dictionary is used to assign the correct identifier and descriptive properties for each item. As illustrated below, using the noun-modifier dictionary, each item is assigned a noun-modifier pair, where the noun is the primary identifier and the modifier is the secondary identifier. Each noun-modifier pair also contains on average five to seven associated attributes, which further describe the characteristics of that item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/3ea31df0-0dc4-4fb4-8050-b0b6972fb52d_Figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 238px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 3 &amp;ndash; Populate Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After standardizing and populating information provided in the customer&amp;rsquo;s raw description, the remaining attributes are populated using internal and external tools such as the master parts library, which contains millions of pre-standardized items. An online research tool assists in the search and collection of additional part information. Using these powerful tools, item descriptions are accurately and efficiently enhanced with information retrieved directly from manufacturer catalogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 4 &amp;ndash; Assign Classification Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once all items have been correctly described by a noun, modifier and corresponding attributes, they can be assigned customer-specified classification codes. The classification codes are typically used for commodity segmentation, spend analysis and other custom reports, enabling companies to leverage purchases and gain insight for improved procurement-related efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 5 &amp;ndash; Identify Duplicate Items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After cleansing and classification is complete, duplicate items within the database are identified by direct duplicate (same manufacturer name and part number) or by form-fit-function (different manufacturer name and part number but identical according to type, size and material). Once duplicates have been identified, they are assigned one common corporate part number, descriptions are duplicated to appear identical throughout the database, and the items are flagged for customer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 6 &amp;ndash; Quality-Control Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the emphasis on quality and consistency, the next step involves a final human review of all items, typically conducted by an assigned project leader or dedicated quality-control person. The quality-control process ensures that every item follows proper format and nomenclature according to pre-defined customer standards, while verifying that enhanced descriptions are correct, accurate and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 7 &amp;ndash; Send Review List to Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, 10 percent of the materials database is usually found to be review items, meaning items lacking critical information for accurate part identification such as manufacturer name or part number. During the data-cleansing process, these items are flagged and compiled into a customer review list. The review list is returned to the customer, who must then physically locate the item within the storeroom and record the necessary part information to be added into the material master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 8 &amp;ndash; Format Data to Customer ERP System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the missing information has been collected for all review items and the entire cleansed database has been approved by quality control, it is deemed complete and transferred to the IT department. At this stage, IT specialists format the data to the customer-specified enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and extract it into a return file. The formatting stage is critical to achieving the desired end result, as every ERP system has its own unique layout, headers and field limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 9 &amp;ndash; Return Cleansed File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the entire data file has been cleansed, standardized, enhanced, de-duplicated, reviewed and formatted to the customer&amp;rsquo;s ERP system, it is electronically delivered to the customer. At this time, the data can now be uploaded directly to the customer&amp;rsquo;s ERP system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Esthetically, the results of data cleansing are obvious, as the data now clearly maintains one consistent format and nomenclature throughout the entire organization while containing enhanced information for improved part identification. However, the real benefits are those that may not be as visually obvious but present the greatest return on investment. The most valuable benefits are those that come from the ability to identify and remove excess, obsolete and duplicate items while improving the ability to quickly search and locate parts when time is of the essence and minimizing equipment downtime is crucial. Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Cost reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification of excess-active and obsolete inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification and elimination of duplicate items&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of equipment downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of maverick purchases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of expedited part orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Improved maintenance efficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficient part searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Maximum ERP/EAM benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved reporting capabilities &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/0f22d95a-0f65-4ce1-9f14-dd689e5b0021_Figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 420px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a long-term perspective, quality materials data is the key to maintaining operation costs and efficiencies. This process does not end once the data-cleansing project is complete. Maintaining ongoing data quality requires a strict set of catalog management procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency as new items are added and existing items are modified or suspended. Most data-cleansing companies offer some type of catalog management software or service for customers to maintain the quality of their cleansed catalog. However, unless the customer is able to dedicate an internal resource to manage the catalog, outsourcing this activity to the experts who originally cleansed the database will always deliver the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Stay Focused to Sustain Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A terrorist with a bomb passes through airport screening undetected on Christmas day. If not for a failure to detonate, many lives would have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When this brazen attack occurred, one of the things made evident was that many of us had let our guards down since 9/11. We had grown less interested than we once were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I recognize this in a related area of my professional life. When I am not working on maintenance systems, part of my consulting practice is in &amp;quot;food defense,&amp;quot; the concept of keeping the bad guys from intentionally contaminating our food supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There was significant interest in this topic after 9/11, as you might imagine. I regret to share with you that today there is far less interest, at least in the United States. Paradoxically, workshops I have taught in Peru, Thailand, Panama and the Caribbean have received considerable interest from their governments, universities and food industry (factories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have a couple of theories why corporate America is so short-sighted. One is that our public-company, quarterly-results-driven world trains us to think and work short term instead of long term. The other is related to a term no longer in vogue but recognizable to all of us in manufacturing: the &amp;quot;flavor of the day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think this phenomenon has gotten worse in our current downsized economy. We have cut beyond the fat into the bones of our organizations. We have let so many people go that we can barely do our daily work and certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have the means to pursue more than one or two improvement initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So we went from responding to the airline terror of 9/11 and food terrorism concerns to the bird flu preparations, to the swine flu response and to the economic downturn. At each juncture, we left behind an unfinished plan or a newborn program left to die of atrophy. This was without malice but also without the energy and resources to keep multiple programs sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We have seen the same with industrial plant maintenance. The total productive maintenance and condition-based maintenance initiatives of the 1980s were never finished or sustained. They were replaced with the proliferation of product forms in the booming 1990s, the packaging initiatives of the early 2000s, the &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; initiatives of recent years and the cost-saving cuts of the past few years. As a result, many of our maintenance programs have failed to advance in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We need to learn from the airlines, which have largely sustained robust maintenance and reliability programs (albeit under Federal Aviation Administration regulation). We cannot let our guard down &amp;mdash; not in our preparations against terror in the skies, not in our defense of the food supply and perhaps, with less life-threatening drama, not in our maintenance and reliability initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/5t9ZUvBwqDQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF Launches Online Maintenance Network</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recently launched an online maintenance network that enables maintenance professionals to connect with other maintenance experts globally, get their feedback on specific problems and find potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With today&amp;#39;s ever-challenging business environment, increasing uptime in manufacturing operations can make the difference between staying competitive and struggling to survive. Consequently, maintenance departments play a crucial role in finding fast answers to equipment breakdowns and thereby minimizing downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every hour of downtime costs the company money and causes high stress levels. In many cases, the fix is only a partial solution that allows production to go on, while the real problem is not tackled until the next maintenance shutdown. The new SKF network service is designed to help find more long-lasting solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The website includes discussion rooms where people can discuss hot topics as well as specific problems and take advantage of the available expertise and solutions around one specific maintenance topic. SKF will regularly introduce different hot topics where maintenance experts can post their problems and/or help other peers. At the end of every such topic, top solution providers will be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Maintenance Network offers an incentive to the participation of solution providers by rewarding them with points. These points can be used to obtain various prizes at the network&amp;#39;s web store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How to Modernize Maintenance Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s one thing to claim customer satisfaction in marketing literature and Web content. It&amp;#39;s another to achieve it by precisely measuring customer specifications and winning ISO 9000 certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Midland Metal Products (MMP) designs and fabricates permanent advertising display fixtures using sheet metal, wire and tubing for a vast array of consumer goods and products. As a fourth-generation supplier, MMP noticed that many of its processes had simply grown with the business. While going through certification audits, it became clear that the company needed to modernize its maintenance management process. Part of that certification process was to implement a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Measurements Count&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because MMP builds advertising displays for ad agencies that serve hundreds of consumer retail brands, it receives specifications from ad agencies to fabricate displays from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Because we do custom displays, we&amp;#39;re bringing to life fabrications that haven&amp;#39;t existed before,&amp;quot; said B.J. McDonald, MMP&amp;#39;s co-owner and facility director. &amp;quot;Erroneous measures can ruin the display. Therefore, our measuring tools have to give precise measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To meet ISO standards, all 242 of MMP&amp;#39;s measuring tools &amp;mdash; from tape measurers to micrometers &amp;mdash; must be calibrated precisely to the customer&amp;#39;s measurement parameters. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The ISO 9001-2008 certification helped us look at our production system and come up with a precise process to do this one thing perfectly all the time &amp;ndash; from the moment you get the customer order to the end product the customer receives,&amp;quot; McDonald explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the close tolerances for MMP&amp;#39;s custom products, calibrating measurement devices was a major issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As part of our certification, ISO auditors looked at whether our measurement devices could fail,&amp;quot; McDonald said. &amp;quot;Bigfoot CMMS helped us win ISO certification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before MMP installed its CMMS, the company had no way to adequately track or maintain any of its measurement devices. Today, MMP uses CMMS to schedule preventive maintenance (PM) for every measurement device used in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, by employing CMMS to issue daily PMs, MMP shows ISO auditors and customers that the company is working within the tolerances of its market. According to ISO standards, each device must have a certificate of calibration to get the designation. This is one area where the company simply cannot miss a PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Maintenance Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MMP not only uses CMMS for measurement devices but also for its entire plant. Within its 110,000-square-foot facility, there are 138 pieces of production machinery equipment, such as turret presses, laser cutters, press brakes and resistance welders. This also includes a total of 2,100 assets from air and power tools to facility equipment, stationary power tools, personal-protection equipment, material handling and even janitorial supplies. However, of the 165 employees, only three are on its maintenance staff. Before CMMS was implemented, McDonald described the maintenance process as &amp;quot;a verbal and casual method of maintenance, responding to the loudest shout.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We had no time to put a preventive maintenance program in place,&amp;quot; he noted. &amp;quot;That also meant noncritical repairs sometimes got fixed before critical requests that were truly important to the operation. So downtime was a problem, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While implementing the two programs seemed like a big task, the initial prep work was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The ISO preparation can seem, at times, as if it&amp;#39;s adding complexity, but the end result is a streamlined system with increased efficiency across the board,&amp;quot; McDonald added.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We get a similar result from our Bigfoot CMMS system. We had to asset-number every piece of equipment we use, down to tape measurers and air-conditioning units. Anything that needs maintenance, replacement, inspection, cleaning and calibration now has maintenance scheduled on Bigfoot CMMS.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MMP also uses CMMS for work orders, repair requests and PM scheduling. Its team generates about 2,400 work orders for PMs a year. This has allowed the company to reduce unforeseen repairs to about 20 percent of its previous workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	PM Efficiencies Boost Uptime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With 15 seats to serve each department and a hierarchy of requestors, MMP has eliminated interruptions from ad-hoc requests. Now, the maintenance staff is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once the PM calendar was set up, we were able to increase maintenance department productivity by being better able to distribute PMs more evenly,&amp;quot; McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CMMS prioritizes high-value machine PMs so MMP can stay ahead of breakdowns. This is where the biggest improvement has been seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With our PM program, we now average 99.6 percent uptime on our production equipment,&amp;quot; McDonald noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ycfbEGPZty4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Improving Maintenance in the New Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;#39;s assume you have an average plant and the economy is tight. You can&amp;#39;t travel, and you must save money. What should your New Year&amp;#39;s resolution be? Here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) If you are going to cut maintenance cost, you cannot focus on cost itself but rather on what drives cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps use an analogy in safety. You can&amp;#39;t just send out a memo or shout &amp;quot;improve safety.&amp;quot; You need to fundamentally change the way people behave. Another analogy is energy cost. How would you reduce energy cost? You have to focus on things that save energy and drive that cost such as leaks, insulation, etc. When it comes to maintenance cost, often it is just slashed without considering the effects of that cost cutting. Again, focus on what drives maintenance cost, not the cost itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Get a common understanding between operations and maintenance on what constitutes good maintenance. &lt;/strong&gt;I recently worked in a plant that has tried for years to improve reliability. However, when asked what constitutes good maintenance, operations answered that &amp;quot;75 percent of the work is executed the same day,&amp;quot; while maintenance answered that &amp;quot;good maintenance is when 4 percent of the work is executed the same day.&amp;quot; Plant personnel must sit down and define &amp;quot;what good looks like.&amp;quot; Otherwise, you will never be able to drive improvement in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Only request maintenance jobs to be done today or tomorrow if it is absolutely necessary. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a principle that makes sense and that most people understand, but few actually do. It is the classic know-do gap. It is also often triggered by not trusting the maintenance department. If it is not submitted as an emergency, it will not be done. In the past, people have started to scream louder and louder to get jobs done. Eventually, everybody is screaming. Managers must take charge and enforce a meaningful priority system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Inspect equipment with detailed look, listen, smell, feel inspections together with a minimum of an infrared gun, flashlight and a stroboscope&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no way you can plan for next week if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is about to break down. Many plants are in a catch-22. &amp;quot;There is no time to do inspections because we have too many breakdowns&amp;quot; is something I hear several times a month. Management has to take charge and break out of this cycle. It will initially cost some additional time that will be saved in both maintenance cost and uptime later. There&amp;#39;s no magic formula. It&amp;#39;s very simple. Collect the tools, find a craftsperson who is highly skilled and willing to do the inspections, and get going. Detailed documentation is necessary at some point, but it is more important to begin the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The above is a good list to start on for the average plant. Most plants do some of this already; however, they just need to improve. There is no capital cost &amp;mdash; just the cost for doing repairs that must be done anyway earlier and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Create a Learning Organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Before you attempt to ask people to learn something new, you should take a few minutes to diagnose their needs and how they might learn best. Not everyone learns the same way, at the same rate, or has the same background or experiences that you do. At the end of the day, you aren&amp;rsquo;t the one learning; they are. Let me share a few experiences with you to highlight the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;rsquo;m often asked to engage with individuals or groups in a coaching fashion to help them address or overcome some issue that the organization is facing. It was during one of these sessions that I was sitting with two front-line supervisors who were discussing the lack of motivation of some of their team. As a side note, when supervision and leadership issues like this come up, I always try to get people to look in the mirror first. This provides a moment of reflection to see if they themselves are the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anyway, they went on to cite how they had developed a ton of procedural documentation that existed in the computer. They complained that the people would not go and pull up the information to facilitate the job, and errors were being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Probing later in the conversation, I asked how the team handled e-mail activities. Basically, not at all was the reply. One laughed and recalled a story about one of their reports recently getting an e-mail from his daughter. He threw up his hands and asked the supervisor how he could reply back to her. The supervisor, short on time and knowing the level of difficultly required to effectively answer, simply told him to &amp;ldquo;call Susan,&amp;rdquo; the worker&amp;rsquo;s daughter. He was implying for him to pick up the phone. The worker looked at the computer and loudly told the computer to &amp;ldquo;call Susan,&amp;rdquo; expecting fully that the computer would allow him to respond to her e-mail in that fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This supervisor was the same one expecting that gentleman to open procedures constantly to do the job and without training to improve those skills. While the individual most definitely can learn, it will not happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Back when I was a practitioner, I worked beside individuals who were very effective at doing the same repetitive types of maintenance and production jobs every day. Talking with them, you would have assumed that they had at least a high-school education. In the end, some did and some didn&amp;rsquo;t, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t take away from the fact that that they were hard workers. I started noticing that some individuals tended to distance themselves from computers and manuals, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I started digging deeper, I found out that they could not read. No, these were not old-timers; one was in his mid-30s and a high-school graduate. They were masters at hiding what most would consider a handicap in today&amp;rsquo;s society. They had learned to adapt and survive. You can imagine how that impacted their ability to take on new tasks or learn from equipment manuals when a new machine came in. When they completed a work order, you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much detail in the closing statements. As a sidebar, when things like this are discovered, you really need to work with human resources to help the individuals raise their skills in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a surprising number of people with learning disabilities, many of whom were never diagnosed at an early age. Learning disabilities are problems that affect the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to receive, process, analyze or store information. There are many different types. It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to seek out help. One supervisor I know shared that his children struggled keeping up in school until he learned of their disability. He spends thousands of dollars every year in special learning programs designed to teach those with such disabilities how to better comprehend the material. It really paid off for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I know of one mechanic who is great on his tools but really struggles with reading documents. When you give the individual a document with a lot of text, the words reverse themselves when he attempts to read it. As such, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t do well on tests, and it has hindered his ability to advance in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I encourage you to create a learning organization. Just keep in mind that not everyone learns the same way or at the same speed, so take a few minutes to consider your methods prior to starting. Put processes in place to measure the results and allow people the opportunity to apply what they learned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/1zs3MJY6NCE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Partnering for Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A major U.S. manufacturer of fabricated steel and metal products was experiencing a troubling and ongoing series of bearing failures on a dual line used for coating operations. A critical bearing located on the outboard roll of the dual line&amp;rsquo;s cleaning section would fail, necessitating repeated replacement. This occurred six times over the short period of four months, resulting in unscheduled downtime (to replace a failed bearing time after time) and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The bearing was the subject of frequent monitoring, with vibration analysis showing no readily detectable problems (all spectra appeared good). Nevertheless, it was only a matter of weeks before the latest replacement bearing took its turn for the worse and for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Determining the root cause of the problem and arriving at a solution ultimately resulted from a unique three-way relationship between the steel manufacturer, on-site reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists (a team of highly trained engineers specializing in specific industries). Both the reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists, working hand in hand, had already become invaluable on-site resources for the operation, serving as intrinsic members of the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s maintenance staff &amp;ndash; regularly attending maintenance planning and scheduling meetings, convening with the customer&amp;rsquo;s reliability manager, and contributing input and suggestions along the way regarding optimized machinery health throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In this case, reliability engineers tagged the &amp;ldquo;bad actor&amp;rdquo; (failed bearing), and the industry specialists performed in-depth detective work into the root cause of failure. The conclusion was that the bearing was failing due to the roll&amp;rsquo;s thrusting in an axial direction, which the particular type of bearing could not accommodate. After documenting that the installed bearing could be suitably replaced by a more appropriate toroidal roller bearing that was specially designed to handle axial displacement without inducing additional axial forces of friction, a switch was made. In addition, a more suitable lubrication recommendation was adopted. The line has been running smoothly ever since without a bearing failure or process interruption. Value added over mean time between repairs (MTBR) to this steel producer was more than $230,000 in the first year, with cash flow breaking even in one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	While this represents an example of how various bearing technologies can solve particular operational challenges, the compelling story runs much deeper and is illustrative of a trend that is gradually shifting the reliability landscape into a new territory &amp;ndash; light years ahead of the conventional (and reactive) practice of engaging maintenance expertise only after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This case especially demonstrates how an operation can elevate reliability partnerships to an entirely new level by teaming with reliability and engineering professionals who become integral members of an organization&amp;rsquo;s maintenance framework. The on-the-scene professionals serve as focused sets of &amp;ldquo;eyes and ears&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; supported by an array of relevant resources and expertise &amp;ndash; to identify and diagnose machinery health problems, propose incisive recommendations to solve them, document all findings in writing, tally anticipated savings and efficiencies to substantiate the efforts, and make necessary fixes just in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This innovative approach (and advanced alternative) to traditional predictive maintenance practices effectively re-casts &amp;ldquo;supporting&amp;rdquo; players into the role of highly involved team players dedicated to the success of an operation&amp;rsquo;s initiatives for continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Creating Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Advantages of this approach can extend well beyond the basic capability to make immediate, timely and long-term fixes to machinery assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	First and foremost, while partnerships between operations and expert resources have always been recognized as critical to the success of reliability programs, the inclusion and participation of experts as actively involved members of an existing maintenance team can help to dramatically improve communications, advance relationships and knowledge, and result in newfound improvements in the health of assets across the board. Committed and sustained partnerships among all players will contribute significantly to the success of any reliability program and create value along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Among value-created opportunities, this approach opens the door to readily available root-cause analysis &amp;ndash; digging as deeply as necessary into machinery health problems to identify the true culprit(s) and take the appropriate remedial action(s). This practice goes well beyond those employed during typical predictive maintenance activities and can help prevent problems from recurring and taking productivity down with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Such improvement initiative programs can further benefit operations by introducing a training element for maintenance staff to equip them with insights into relevant procedures and technologies to help lower the total cost of operations and to recognize &amp;ndash; and remedy &amp;ndash; a problem when they detect one. Routine maintenance procedures can be improved, too, as maintenance education and awareness expand and new technologies are put into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	For example, a U.S. taconite mining operation has partnered with a dedicated team of reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists with powerful results. The engineers conduct weekly predictive maintenance &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; throughout the operation, provide reports advising machine conditions and recommended actions, and recover or preserve failed components (such as bearings) accompanied with a detailed history of the failure(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In turn the industry specialists, who are well versed in the mining field, perform damage analysis, report and document the root cause, and recommend improvements designed to eliminate repetitive failures. The specialists additionally provide on-site training associated with bearing and seal installations, as well as support during installations &amp;ndash; all of which are highly valued by the mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Specific project successes at this site included the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Root-cause failure analysis showed that conveyor pulley bearing failures were being caused by the ingress of contaminants and were resolved with an improved sealing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Mill pinion bearing failures were linked after analysis to poor support for the bearing and ingress of contaminants, and were remedied with a recommended improvement to the bearing housing fit, custom sealing system solution, and pinion rebuild and replacement overseen by the industry specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Dust-collector fans suffered from poor installation practices, and training was subsequently provided to demonstrate the proper use of a hydraulic assist for installation (consisting of a hydraulic nut, hydraulic pump and dial indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Making the Grade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	While this real-world demonstration of teamwork can help reap measurable rewards from improved asset reliability, increased machinery uptime and enhanced productivity, such initiatives will be highly dependent on the level of expertise and the extent of a reliability partner&amp;rsquo;s experience, capabilities, and supporting resources and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Among the questions to ask when beginning the selection process for a reliability team to help realize optimized results consistent with a viable continuous improvement initiative include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;bull; &lt;/em&gt;Can knowledge and experience specific to your industry be demonstrated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Are the provider&amp;rsquo;s supporting resources (from technologies and services to analysis and training) sufficiently extensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Does the provider understand how reliability influences the life-cycle management of assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the team respond quickly when machinery problems unexpectedly occur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the team seamlessly blend with the existing maintenance function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will written documentation on problems and recommended solutions be part of the package?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will the provider be suitably equipped to support equipment fixes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the provider demonstrate a close relationship with distributor sources to supply solutions in a timely manner when required?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will program progress be measured in a meaningful way? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will total cost of operations be demonstrably reduced over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The answers to these (and related) questions can help guide decision-making when selecting a reliability partner best equipped to sustain a continuous improvement initiative and accrue both immediate and long-term benefits for any operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>University of Kansas Offers Course in Managing Shutdowns</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In response to the millions of dollars of production that companies lose in poorly planned shutdowns, the University of Kansas has launched a new certificate course, &amp;quot;The Basics of Shutdowns, Turnarounds and Outages.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This online class will address the basic issues of shutdowns and is designed for heavy maintenance environments including refineries, power plants, chemical plants, mines, large factories and other large facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Attendees will gain anew and deeper understanding of how to effectively manage large maintenance jobs such as power-plant outages and refinery refits,&amp;quot; said Joel Levitt, course instructor and author of &lt;em&gt;Managing Maintenance Shutdowns and Outages&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;This will result in an increased ability to plan for and manage such projects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The course will be delivered in three modules, beginning on Oct. 23, 2012. The live online webinar sessions meet on Tuesday evenings at 7 p.m. (Eastern Time). During the one-hour sessions, students will have the opportunity to interact with the instructor as he helps them evaluate and improve their current programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All sessions will be recorded, allowing students to watch them at a later time if one is missed. Quizzes and discussions will also be held online but can be done at any time that is convenient for the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Foster Teamwork for Better Results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A major mail-processing plant in Philadelphia with approximately 2,000 employees on five floors was experiencing unscheduled absences greater than 7 percent along with poor quality and high expenses. Its reputation was questionable. If you walked the plant floors, you would have trouble seeing farther than 50 feet. You would also notice deplorable restrooms (not a custodial issue), an absence of supervision, paint peeling from the walls and lots of red-tagged rolling stock on the floor. In spite of this, the maintenance department was held in high esteem as it managed to keep the equipment operating. You can imagine the magnitude of union grievances, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO) complaints and letters to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant manager, Al LaRiviere, had a challenge. His first actions were to remove all red-tagged equipment as well as the equipment that was not being used. The number of items that were placed in the parking lot numbered more than 1,000. More than half were scrapped, while the others were eventually repaired at another facility. Next, he began a process-management study of what really transpired in the plant and worked to get management involved as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was a 24-hour, 365-day plant with three shifts per day. There were approximately 350 employees in the maintenance staff to manage the building&amp;rsquo;s more than 1 million square feet, customer lobbies, 20 acres of land, more than 200 pieces of automation, 2 miles of conveyor, all custodial needs and the 25 stations around the city. The original plant was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project and had been modified numerous times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Originating mail (mailed within the plant&amp;rsquo;s service area) and destinating mail (coming into the plant&amp;rsquo;s processing area) processes were broken into streams (letters, parcels, small items and bundles). It had an inventory turn of 365 per year (unable to store mail). Critical metrics were measured in days from the mail being placed in a box to the delivery day (delivery standards). Each type of mail had different standards. There was also a quasi-metric of work hours used versus work hours earned (budget performance). These were the results metrics on which the plant manager was rated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An external evaluation of the management team&amp;rsquo;s competencies recommended team training, individual training, and development of all supervisors and managers on interpersonal skills and how to supervise. This was begun concurrent with the process-management study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the study, the performance indicators were identified as process or results. Examples of process were absence, production, unit quality and meeting work-area clearance times. The bottom line was did the mail clear the various operations having had quality sortation and did the right mail get on the correct transportation at the scheduled dispatch time. These last two questions became the plant results indicators. If they were consistently met, the plant&amp;rsquo;s delivery standards were met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with the process study results, LaRiviere made a decision that he only wanted his management teams to be concerned with two metrics &amp;mdash; clearing the mail on time and quality of sortation. He felt that productivity was the result of the individuals&amp;rsquo; motivation and would accompany the meeting of the indicators. These became the results indicators for each supervisor&amp;rsquo;s/superintendent&amp;rsquo;s processing areas. The shift managers had the results indicators of the right mail on the right trucks at the right time. All staff meetings or other management discussions were limited to those two sets of metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere even had a small stand with three steps built for the conference room. If a person failed his metrics, he had to climb the steps to stand up and be counted. There was no follow-up discussion. However, LaRiviere did institute celebrations for achievements (lots of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training for all employees focused on the two metrics and the process within their work areas. Supervisors were not to focus on absence rates, individual performance, reasons for incoming mail quality or being critical about any other process with their employees. It was the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to worry about upstream and downstream problems and to have his or her employees focus on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supervisors were also to develop a team. Each supervisor posted his or her team&amp;rsquo;s process indicators each day (how much was processed, work hours, internal quality and delayed mail). All machine operators were trained on using the machine-generated production reports, and rudiments of overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) were built into the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make this work, plant employees were assigned to specific supervisors. All supervisors adhered to the game plan and were kept informed of overall U.S. Postal Service performance, their plant performance and their own area&amp;rsquo;s effect on performance. They were becoming respected go-to people for the craft employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere believed that if employees knew that their managers were all on the same ship, where it was going and the game plan for getting there, they would find the confidence and motivation to perform and go home at night with a sense of accomplishment and pride in their plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance employees were trained on interpreting equipment performance reports, understanding the customer-supplier relationship with operators and relating to the operations people in a problem-solving mode to stop the blame game. Conversations between employees and their supervisor centered on processes in their work areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have only touched the surface of this remarkable turnaround. Unscheduled absences dropped to 3 percent, productivity increased 20 percent and the plant&amp;rsquo;s quality led the region. Would you believe they now had too many people coming to work each day? Employees now counted on supervisors to supervise, keep them informed and buffer them. Supervisors now held their heads up and looked forward to coming to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere also had the interior plant painted and put up meaningful signage to make it a visual workplace. He reduced the number and size of restrooms (original employment was more than 4,000 employees). He then worked the same process with human resources, finance, maintenance, vehicle operations and office staffs. LaRiviere was a unique manager who was at the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this is not necessarily a maintenance story, it does illustrate the use of process-management tools, the understanding of what makes people tick and what a vision can produce when the top dog is given the freedom to take a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ltgEU87Bo-0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Seize Opportunities to Improve Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lean efforts used to be 100-percent directed at the shop floor. What we have seen recently is that lean is moving into non-traditional areas of business. A lot of our recent work has been in maintenance, procurement, distribution, engineering, the office and even the company kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A friend of mine recently sent me an article about how Starbucks is realizing benefits from lean efforts in its stores. The coffee-shop giant is doing spaghetti charts, videotaping the work effort and working to reduce the time it takes to process an order. If Starbucks can shave 20 to 30 seconds off an order process that takes 1 minute, 45 seconds, that is a 23-percent improvement. Multiply that by 1,000 orders and you have saved nearly seven hours of effort. That&amp;rsquo;s certainly enough to save overtime, do more with less and spend more time making customers happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, please keep in mind that the goal of lean is never to rush the process and make the quality worse but merely to eliminate the waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So many organizations miss the opportunities to improve in almost all aspects of their business. If you can work to shave time here and there through process improvements on menial tasks, the quality of the entire process can improve, since the employee can spend more time on the important tasks at hand, work less overtime (if hourly) or, if salaried, work less hours and be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We worked with one group that had a fabrication department that received the job packets on the shop floor between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. when the operation started at 6 a.m. Despite the fact that the orders were printed every day at midnight, the orders sat in queue or on someone&amp;rsquo;s desk in queue awaiting work for nine-plus hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each day, the company was losing three to four hours of work time due to waiting on paperwork. Although they had work to do and were not idle, with a four-day lead-time, if an order lost nine hours because of paperwork, they were losing 9.4 percent of their time at the front end due to delays. It is no wonder their on-time performance was in the 80-percent range. They were starting off nine hours late just because of paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would encourage everyone to review their entire value-stream processes and find areas that are non- traditional to improve the waste. Take off your regular glasses and put on your waste glasses. You will be shocked at the opportunities that you will find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/QurYdaBavPc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Employ Standard Work in Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In many organizations, the focus on maintenance tasks is too general in nature, trusting the craftsperson to do the right thing. While we should trust our people, most of whom are highly competent and skilled, we also should set the expectation for the work to be accomplished in a precise manner. Otherwise, how do we improve if there is no one method of &amp;quot;standard work&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recognize that if we leave it up to individuals, we will have as many methods as we have individuals who do the work. As a team using the continuous feedback process, we want to determine the most effective and precise method to perform any given task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why, might you ask? Using precision maintenance, you reduce or avoid early life failure due to resonance, unbalance, soft foot, contamination (i.e., moisture, chemical, particle), poor lubrication, excessive heat or friction, looseness, imbalance or misalignment. Remember that roughly 89 percent of failures occur in early life or during the constant failure period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rather than just &amp;quot;Check belt&amp;quot; as a task, use &amp;quot;Check belt for tightness (using a belt tension device), fraying, cracking or damage.&amp;quot; More specifically, what should the tension be? With other components, what should the torque be on the fasteners? What should the gap, clearances or tolerances be? What is the maximum vibration allowable on the installation of new equipment? Where is the precision alignment? Do you use sheave gauges to determine wear? How much wear is acceptable prior to replacement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you perform &amp;quot;standard work&amp;quot; in your maintenance tasks? If not, give it a try. You just might like the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/tV0hw6V7phI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Minimize Waste with a Smooth Work Flow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common performance metrics is planned vs. unplanned work orders. The benchmark goal has been 90 percent planned (preventive maintenance and other planned activities) and 10 percent unplanned corrective/breakdown maintenance. In reality, with most organizations the ratio is anywhere from 10 to 30 percent planned maintenance to 90 to 70 percent unplanned. This is indicative of operating in a reactive mode, which contributes to waste, reduced equipment life and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A thorough understanding and analysis of a maintenance work process flow makes it easier to identify and eliminate waste. The goal is not only to eliminate waste but to develop an improved work process flow that is more effective and productive. As the flow is thoroughly reviewed and analyzed, the entire process flow becomes visible and wasteful activities such as delays, unnecessary travel and the like are easily identified.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some ways to minimize wasteful activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Trending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring usually involves the use of installed devices (gauges, meters, etc.) to monitor the operating conditions of equipment and other assets. An example is pressure and temperature readings on a boiler. Maintenance can establish operating limits for the condition(s) being monitored and trend the observed data. If the observed data is outside of a certain predefined range of values, some maintenance action may be required. This is referred to as condition-based maintenance. It can be very effective and less expensive than periodic or fixed frequency maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning and Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planner/scheduler&amp;rsquo;s role is very important in a lean maintenance environment. The goal is to optimize utilization of available resources. Detailed job plans should be developed for all approved open work orders including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number and type of labor resources (how many plumbers, carpenters, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time estimates so required manpower can be determined&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detailed job steps including permit/safety requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Parts and tool requirements (pre-kit if possible)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clear job instructions, drawings, sketches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job site walk down to determine the most efficient way of doing the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment availability coordination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Outside contractor requirements (if any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Delays must be avoided at all cost. Weekly scheduling must be done with daily fine tuning as necessary. This level of detail and coordination is required to achieve a lean and efficient maintenance operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Developing the Abilities of the Maintenance Manager</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s environment of reliability excellence, integrated maintenance/operations teams, new technologies and constant pressure to make maintenance more effective and elevate it to a prominent value-added position, the maintenance manager must become a business unit manager with equal footing with other plant functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance managers operate a business within a business. They have 24-hour/seven-days-a-week responsibility, a product to deliver, customers, resource allocations, planning, people development responsibilities, political acumen, accountability and drive. They also have the highest-trained workforce with a lot of untapped talent and creativity. What should this professional manager have in his backpack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the last 10 years of my career at the United States Postal Service, I sponsored a maintenance leadership mentoring program that was designed to improve and expand the abilities of our managers to meet the demands of today and tomorrow. We strived to first develop leaders, then business managers and finally maintenance management professionals. Each two-year class had 10 mentors matched with 10 prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;s who were not from the same plant. They met together for eight weekly workshops over two years. All 20 people experienced the same training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A full year of meetings and activities was devoted to the understanding of self and interpersonal effectiveness. Various methods were used to help the manager learn about himself and to understand diversity in others. In group discussions and by using psychologists, they discovered how they could become effective in leading, persuading and managing others as well as themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the first year, they were immersed in formal classes on the business of business (marketing, accounting, economics, strategy and quantitative management). It is imperative to be able to converse with other functions in non-maintenance terms using their business lingo. When not in the classroom, workshops were held on process management, maintenance control, metrics, best maintenance practices and specific areas unique to each individual&amp;rsquo;s development needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They also subscribed to business magazines and attended professional society meetings and conferences. This was followed up with two weeks of reliability excellence training and with each individual taking the certified plant maintenance manager&amp;rsquo;s exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The awareness of self and the business of business were prescribed as foundation activities to build upon. Using this foundation and the expectations developed from the best maintenance processes, each person developed his or her own unique individual development plan to be completed in the two-year program. During the two-year program, these people also performed as operations supervisors for 90 days in their own plant and as maintenance managers for 90 days in another plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Probably the most controversial session was about civility or how the manager presents himself/herself in various settings. This ranged from table manners and writing thank-you notes to professional appearance and proper English. The mentors named it &amp;ldquo;the charm school session.&amp;rdquo; However, all participants were grateful they were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mentors were nominated from their specific regions and received special training on mentoring. Most important was the concept that people are responsible for their own growth. While mentors fulfilled many roles, their prime efforts were to facilitate the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; finding his or her answers. The best mentors were great storytellers and able to relate experiences from which the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; could glean information for his or her individual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Very few managers have the privilege to participate in such a program, yet the basic tenants hold true &amp;mdash; self, business acumen, process orientation, continuous personal growth and development of others. Industry needs the best trained and highly motivated workforce possible. Managers of today should work continuously to grow that environment in their companies. This responsibility lies with functional management; the human resources function acts to support (not own) the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is within a manager&amp;rsquo;s authority to institute a learning environment. The managers at the top must set the example and truly believe in their own growth and that of their employees. They must walk the talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/mNqWPeJ3B1A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Follow-up is Key for Greater Efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are using their computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) as a record-keeping tool. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they want, a spreadsheet perhaps can suffice. A correctly used CMMS is a tool that goes way beyond record-keeping. By not fully utilizing the CMMS, maintenance operations are missing out on opportunities to save time and money. As the utilization of CMMS increases, overall productivity and profitability also increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure you know the full functionality of your CMMS and plan ways to improve your use of it in the future. A CMMS gives you the ability to look at a massive amount of data that can be tracked over time, enabling you to make meaningful decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Full utilization of the CMMS begins with the process flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Ideal Process Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are eight components of a good maintenance work process flow: notification, approval, planning, scheduling, dispatching, executing, follow-up and performance matrix. In my experience over the last 20 years, I always see three out of these eight key components. These are notification, dispatching and executing of work. Beyond that, however, the other five may not be in place at all or only in a limited form &amp;mdash; for example, planning and scheduling. However, two categories that are consistently absent are follow-up and performance matrix, even in some of the most modern maintenance environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Follow-up/Continuous Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A large part of follow-up involves reviewing and interpreting CMMS reports and completed work orders. Someone, most likely a planner or a supervisor, should review these items on a regular basis. Whether it is daily or weekly, these reports need to be consistently monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some examples of follow-up items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Root Cause: &lt;/strong&gt;By monitoring completed work orders, you may find that there is a repeated failure on a piece of equipment. This alerts you to the fact that there is a larger problem with the device. Maintenance workers are mostly working under stressful conditions, and they are almost always rushed. They often don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to properly diagnose the problem. Instead, they perform a quick-fix, and the problem will eventually occur again. If you are performing consistent follow-up, however, you can catch this and allow more time to fix the problem completely. This saves time in the long run as you aren&amp;rsquo;t repeatedly bandaging the same injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CMMS is a great tool for analyzing the data and making meaningful decisions. Examples include reviewing work-order schedule compliance, ratios of preventive maintenance and repair work orders compared to total work orders, and taking necessary corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Readings: &lt;/strong&gt;Maintenance operations frequently gather readings on a variety of equipment such as boilers, chillers, etc. In a paper-based system, forms are filled out and filed away (never to be found again). Some companies have started using their CMMS to record and save these readings (i.e., pressure, temperature, etc.). The purpose of this data is to identify abnormal readings and correct problems to prevent failures. A CMMS is just the tool to accomplish that. Once you have defined a certain range and criteria, the CMMS will flag a warning immediately upon meeting those criteria. For example, if the temperature reading falls outside of a certain range, it will notify you instantly so you can take corrective action. Otherwise, it can turn into a catastrophic failure in the future. Maintenance planning can automatically incorporate usage and condition-based preventive maintenance, predictive failure maintenance and corrective maintenance resulting from abnormal readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Make the Most of Your Time: &lt;/strong&gt;CMMS can be an excellent tool to identify non-value-added activities and shorten process cycle time as part of a follow-up/continuous improvement program. Maintenance spends a great deal of time waiting for parts, approval, instructions and equipment to be available. A CMMS can help identify where exactly maintenance is losing most of the time, enabling you to analyze the situation and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow-up and continuous improvement hinge on the same often under-utilized quality of a CMMS &amp;mdash; data reporting. It is all well and good to track and store data, but it is useless if that data is never examined. By monitoring reports and completed work orders through a follow-up and continuous improvement process, you constantly make your operation more efficient. Higher efficiency means lower operating costs, larger savings and increased profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Streamline Your Maintenance Operation for Optimum Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If your backlog is piling up or you feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources in terms of labor and parts, it may be time to work toward lean maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance is the application of lean philosophies, methods, tools and techniques to maintenance functions. It has the fundamental goals of eliminating waste associated with labor, inventory, procedures and techniques, resulting in improved productivity and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance does not imply a slash and dash approach to cutting costs and jobs. This common method will not reduce waste or lower costs. Instead, lean maintenance philosophy decreases costs by getting rid of waste that can be defined as &amp;ldquo;anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add value to the maintenance process or service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are a few areas where wastefulness and sluggishness can crop up in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Overproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overproduction in the maintenance environment means doing any work that does not add value. Examples include performing preventive and predictive maintenance tasks more often than is necessary and redoing jobs that were not done correctly the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Areas of waste in this category include maintenance personnel waiting for equipment availability, job assignments, tools, parts, instructions, other crafts, permit approval, etc. Waiting is not a value-added activity and should be eliminated or reduced as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary travel is the result of ineffective planning and scheduling. This could involve a trip to the maintenance shop to get technical information or to the storeroom for parts and tools. Poorly designed preventive maintenance (PM) routes are also a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Process Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When performing a breakdown repair, maintenance personnel are typically under a lot of pressure to fix the equipment as quickly as possible and often are not given enough time to fix the equipment properly. This results in a poor repair and a recurring problem. Properly performed repairs can eliminate this process waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most organizations now use some sort of computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM). Process waste also occurs when inefficiencies exist in these systems. For example, a poorly designed system may call for multiple entries of the same data, or a material requisitioning process could require redundant approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In maintenance, a defect can be defined as leaving an asset in an unreliable condition. There are many causes of defects in the maintenance environment. Defects due to poor workmanship arise from insufficient training, inadequate/outdated procedures and not having the proper tools to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Spare Parts Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most storerooms contain a significant amount of obsolete inventory. This ties up capital and consumes management resources. It can easily amount to 10 to 20 percent of annual inventory dollars. Keep in mind that excess inventory is not obsolete but is inventory maintained at unnecessarily high levels. Excess inventory also ties up capital and consumes management resources. In addition, inadequate PM programs cause equipment failures, which in turn results in the need for more parts (consuming working capital) and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A CMMS/EAM can monitor and control a spare parts inventory. It will keep track of inventory items, vendor performance, parts receipts, issues and returns. In addition, a CMMS/EAM can automate the parts purchasing process. Vendor managed and stocked inventory can also drastically reduce the parts quantity in the storeroom and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While breakdowns and failures are never planned, they can cause the loss of productivity and money. Finding the root cause of a failure provides an organization with a solvable problem. Once the root cause is identified, a fix can be developed and implemented, preventing a recurring failure situation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using Overall Equipment Effectiveness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I became a skeptic of overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) when I saw the performance on the midnight shift at a well-run plant nosedive. The low OEE was on the shift performance dashboard and attracted undue attention. Local plant management blamed maintenance, and the maintenance manager called me to support him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An investigation showed that operations had decided one employee could operate a machine that regularly required two employees. In fact, sometimes they assigned one employee to operate two machines. Usually, one employee would keep the machine fed and cull out poor feedstock, while a second would remove the processed product and clear the jams that occurred every 10 minutes for about 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OEE was down to about 40 percent for equipment that usually achieved 70 to 80 percent. Further investigation revealed a wider batch-processing window than on the other shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line was that the labor cost per unit processed was reduced by nearly 40 percent while meeting production timeframes. Operations really did not know the makeup of OEE, and instead of defending their numbers, they chose to cast blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For those who do not remember the OEE formula, for the required run window, it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Throughput performance percentage x quality performance percentage x uptime performance percentage = OEE (expressed as a percentage)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is the quick two-penny version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who uses OEE? Hopefully, it is used by those who know what the three factors mean and how they are measured. My experience says there are various levels of OEE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OEE was thought to be the miracle metric by some organizations, and a lot of management attention still is paid to the metric. I submit that the metric at a plant level means squat to the line operator &amp;mdash; and plant level was the original use of OEE. Yet it is this operator and his or her maintenance technician that makes or breaks the company during the operating shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Could an OEE be developed that was a meaningful metric to the line machine operators? How about for the engineers and process developers who established equipment performance and line-balancing parameters? How about the supervisor who oversees a production of machines in series? How about the planners and schedulers? In other words, specific OEEs could be developed that represent the specific impacts various players have on the plant performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;rsquo;ll even go one further. How about the finance guys who watch the pennies? How about human relations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies recognize the importance of customers, employees, resources and the bottom-line budget performance. It not possible to separate them, yet each must be managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the late 1990s, my old organization searched for a meaningful metric to gauge employee motivation and satisfaction with the workplace. The usual factors of safety, attendance, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints and grievances were numbers that alone could not be individually correlated to performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As we moved out of the 1950s and into the enlightened times of the late 20th century, the old term KSA (knowledge, skills and abilities) did not seem to be the end-all when dealing with workers. We wanted them to no longer leave their brains at the front door. We wanted the whole person on the job. Empowerment, quality of working life, involvement, and the importing back into U.S. industry of Deming&amp;rsquo;s and Crosley&amp;rsquo;s quality concepts caused an upheaval in how management must view and treat the worker. Then came total productive maintenance, lean, Toyota, process management and a host of other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The literature began to talk of employee talents, situational flexibility, learning organizations, systems thinking, self-direction and self-motivation. My organization categorized this as employee willingness. Yes, we hire a person that walks through the door with KSAs. What happens to his or her willingness or desire to produce to his/her finest? Can we measure that, and what do we need to help him or her walk out of the plant at the end of the day feeling satisfied?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I once had a manager who said that if we provide the right tools and timely, pertinent information, then employees will work. That means the organization exists to support the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so how does all of this hot air relate to OEE? It can be timely information. It can identify training and skill problems. It can indicate process and equipment problems. And, it is a barometer of employee willingness. Should, therefore, OEE be an analytical metric? Absolutely. Otherwise, throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line was that OEE became a top-level workforce metric for plant management. At the same time, all processing equipment produced (in real time) the OEE that the operators managed to gauge their performance and analyze problems. The biggest issue was to train supervisors and superintendents to use the same OEE as a diagnostic tool to help remove obstacles to operator performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The directors of HR were now held responsible for understanding OEE and how it should be viewed and used. It was no longer an &amp;ldquo;operations problem&amp;rdquo; but a plant-wide tool to recognize employee excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/_1b4p3WiNuU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability is a Green Initiative</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Demand for products has declined in many parts of the world, and with more manufacturing being shipped overseas, reliability of our existing processes is even more important than before. Many of my friends in different industries have told me about all of the initiatives being done to &amp;ldquo;green up&amp;rdquo; their facilities and processes. Going green and being environmentally responsible is a great thing, and I think we should be pushing to move more in that direction. With that said, the interesting thing that I have been hearing is that reliability is getting lost in the green push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think reliability is the first green initiative we should invest in. Some people will argue that reliability is not a green initiative, but I assure you that it is. It&amp;rsquo;s no mystery that part of being green is doing more with less. Improved reliability will mean a decrease in demand of raw materials and storage space for those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A benefit in decreased use of raw materials means longer-term sustainability of the raw materials. This will also make it easier to project needs of materials because the process will be more stable and predictable. The decreased amount of raw materials may increase the cost per unit, but it usually will be far offset by the second part of reliability being a green initiative, which is a decrease in waste materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The decrease in waste materials will have a huge impact on cost and safety. Not only does the decrease in waste materials mean a reduction in disposal but also decreased cost in storage of the waste materials. In addition, the decreased amount of especially hazardous waste reduces the risk of environmental or safety incidents occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not in any way saying that we need to set the green initiatives aside. What I am saying is that reliability should take the front seat and not get put behind green. Reliability is a green initiative in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Nt0heiNV3_M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Prioritizing Maintenance Work Orders</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the challenges that many organizations face is maintaining work order priorities in the wake of the emotional squeaky wheel that yells the loudest. Remember the phrase, &amp;ldquo;In God we trust. All others bring data&amp;rdquo;? It applies here as well. Reacting to false priorities exacerbates the reactive spiral that diverts resources from efficient work practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the day, I don&amp;rsquo;t know of many organizations that are overwhelmed with maintenance resources to do work. Reality is that maintenance activities are all about lessening or mitigating risk or the consequences of failure. The challenge for all involved in determining the potential risk is to estimate the probability of the breakdown occurring within a period of time. To succeed, it is important that maintenance and operations have a proactive partnership where they work together to understand and communicate the risk probability via the work order system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to effectively accomplish this, the organization should have a priority matrix. This is a matrix chart with the estimated time to the potential breakdown or functional failure on one side (typically in days) and the consequences of failure on the other side (90 degrees out). Categories may include health and safety, environmental, operations loss,&amp;nbsp; and customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the organization establishes the matrix, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect people to understand the intent without training. Train everyone and hold them accountable. Early on, frequently inspect to ensure that the organization is properly following the matrix when coding the priority on the work orders and requests. Put at least a monthly audit process in place to ensure compliance is ongoing. That said, recognize that it&amp;rsquo;s a tool and not the end-all. It&amp;rsquo;s an estimate that you use to set the target date for the work to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integrate the work-order priority into other work such as preventive maintenance activities and engineering projects when you create the maintenance schedules. Using this technique, only interrupt the prioritized schedule work with work of a higher or more urgent priority. Work already in progress should take priority over new work of the same or equal priority. This will help you to avoid &amp;ldquo;breaking the schedule&amp;rdquo; unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ICbOSL-pmrM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/21/db3e2155-bba9-4d10-bb44-e71d81e61d1f_EnerpacLiftBeneathDozer.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 205px; float: left;" /&gt;Enerpac recently introduced the DLS Series Dozer Lift System for servicing and maintaining 250,000-pound dozers in various mining and construction applications. Designed specifically for the CAT D11 and D10 dozers, the lift system is ideal for track and side-frame maintenance while utilizing single-operator lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The dozer lift features a four-point custom synchronous lift system for safe load control, with two separate lifting units that can be moved into position at opposite ends of a dozer. Each lifting unit includes two hydraulically operated jacks with motorized locking rings for safe operation. The jacks are bolted to a rolling cart with fork pockets and retractable wheels for easy and precise positioning of the units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The front and rear lifting jacks are driven by a hydraulic power unit (HPU) and controls that include a 25-foot pendant for operator mobility and safety. The entire HPU and controls are contained in a rolling cabinet that has storage for cable reels and hoses. The controls also include a programmable logic controller (PLC) and software to monitor and manage a maximum of four lifting points simultaneously with a color touchscreen mounted inside the cabinet. A single hydraulic unit has the capacity to operate up to six lifting units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lifting and lowering of the jacks can be paused at any point, and the system will automatically secure the load mechanically until the operator is ready to begin lifting or lowering the dozer again. A built-in alarm system will stop the synchronous lift in the event of malfunction. Lifting speed is approximately 1.8 inches per minute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of weight distribution, the system is designed to lift and lower a dozer synchronously between all lift points. It will also fit beneath dozers with 90-percent track wear, providing enough height clearance to perform track maintenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Is Your Plant Organization Shipshape?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/15/a3f84777-ae33-49c0-bca6-32f83ded19c5_ship.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;You are in the engine room of the USS Lincoln. Your job as an oiler is to perform the cleaning and lubrication routes for the steam turbines. You are watching a control panel that monitors all of the ship&amp;rsquo;s mechanical functions. You have trust that the folks up on the bridge are in agreement about where and how the ship is to travel. All 2,000 sailors rely on the functional teams working in concert to make this voyage a success. You also have faith that this is the finest ship ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From Robert Williamson&amp;rsquo;s NASCAR model of teamwork to this very large aircraft carrier, there are well-coordinated activities and responsibilities that are carried out in world-class style. Hopefully, this article will cause you to pause and examine the possibilities for you and your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my role as manager of the U.S. Postal Service&amp;rsquo;s Technical Support Center, I approved all maintenance management and maintenance work directives and manuals that were transmitted to the 450 plants to the 16,000 field technicians through their plant maintenance organizations. When I occasioned to visit plant workroom floors, I sought out the maintenance technicians and let them meet the name at the bottom of the directives. I usually inquired about the working environment in which they carried out their daily tasks. The usual questions were about information, tools, scheduling, equipment conditions and the visibility of top management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The responses were what I expected given the metrics I reviewed and my knowledge of the individual plants. What I began to focus on was the response to this question: If I was able to clap my hands and something magically changes in your plant, what would you want to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More often than not, their response was: &amp;ldquo;We want managers to talk to managers and there be continuity in our operations across shifts and interfunction. It appears that managers are competing within their ranks &amp;mdash; for what, we don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years, I probably asked this of several hundred employees, and many of the answers related to the interaction of management within the plant. They wanted the magic fix to be management that worked together, shift changes that were transparent, maintenance to work with operations, supervisors to be knowledgeable about expectations, and to feel part of the team. In essence, they wanted to perform like the USS Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best model to explain their chagrin is that of an organization chart turned 90 degrees. Think of the &amp;ldquo;Sweet Sixteen&amp;rdquo; in the national college basketball tournament. Where the normal organization chart represents structure, information and decision flow, the employees view it as a competition chart with management competing for different prizes that they do not understand. Is it power, turf, pride, confusion, floundering, ineptitude, leadership or mission that causes this issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I asked them to give examples. Their responses were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operations priorities do not match those of maintenance or customer service.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is no shift transition process. This can be between maintenance shifts or within operations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Process improvements on one shift are discarded by the next shift.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Managers purposely avoid other managers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On-the-job training and breaking in new employees take too much time away from productive activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The most important employees (the machine operators and the maintenance technicians) are not a part of the management team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Human resources does not support the supervisors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The plant is dirty and signage is outdated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We are unaware of the mission and goals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are conflicting goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They don&amp;rsquo;t want to run the place; they just want to know the game plan and where the ship is on its voyage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Hh3GSPKqDDc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliable Processes Eliminate Surprises</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Surprises have their place, but they are not welcome in a manufacturing operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of the goals for manufacturing in our organization has to be to eliminate surprises,&amp;rdquo; a CFO of a U.S. manufacturing company said recently. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to prevent ugly surprises from disrupting our production schedule and, consequently, our deliveries to our customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two primary goals for any manufacturing operation today: 1) deliver the proper products at the proper time with the expected quality and 2) continually reduce the entire cost of delivering on goal No. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To achieve both of these goals, the organization has to be focused on getting their processes reliable and consistent. As the processes become more reliable and consistent, cost-reduction activities can be implemented and focused on specific parts of the product or process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a reliable or consistent process, efforts are spent trying to solve production problems rather than reduce cost. Precious time is spent trying to look for ways to &amp;ldquo;work around the problem,&amp;rdquo; or the decision is made to &amp;ldquo;throw resources at it&amp;rdquo; to make a promised delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/15/f123f527-e5cd-4d60-bd5a-ad8dd8281d64_surprises.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 262px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s environment of capacity reduction, having a consistent and reliable process provides more clarity into the ramifications of certain decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anything that disrupts the flow of manufacturing from being reliable and consistent is an ugly surprise. Some surprises can be minor, while others can be major, but either can keep the manufacturing team focused on solving the current problem rather than on the two primary objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the production of the product is not consistent and reliable, the customers do not know when to expect their order, or the company has to carry excessive amounts of inventory. When production surprises make the production process unreliable, it is difficult to schedule supplier deliveries properly, either halting production due to a lack of raw materials or increasing the raw material inventory requirements of the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ugly surprises come in many forms and from many places. An ugly surprise results in unexpected downtime of a manufacturing operation. Ugly surprises can be machine failure, missed supplier deliveries, lack of proper organization, poor production techniques, poor quality and many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying some common sense can eliminate most ugly surprises. Other ugly surprises can prove to be more difficult to diagnose and resolve. All ugly surprises need to be eliminated and prevented from ever returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How often do ugly surprises come to visit your organization? What do these ugly surprises look like? How do you make sure these ugly surprises feel unwelcome and never feel invited back in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/mRmvWNf7Ly8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Attain Reliability and Maintainability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Do you&amp;nbsp;have double vision? I hope you do, but not in the sense I bet that you are thinking. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about having one too many or that splitting headache that sometimes results in double vision. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about driving availability. It&amp;rsquo;s a measure that is made up of two component measures &amp;mdash; mean time before failure (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The equation is: Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I hope you would agree that MTBF is a measure of reliability. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that one of the primary visions that you have for your organization, driving improved reliability? I recently worked with a client in the heavy industrial sector on just that, an equipment reliability improvement effort that involves failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and other techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about MTTR? It&amp;rsquo;s a measure of maintainability, or the average (mean) amount of time required to complete the repair or restoration of a failed component. It&amp;rsquo;s more than just a second part of the availability equation; it must be included as a separate integrated vision for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reality is that very little attention is paid to making equipment easy to maintain in many organizations. Yet, it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to justify simple, often inexpensive modifications to new or existing equipment to make it maintenance friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A piece of equipment that I was asked to include in the FMEA effort makes for a great example. A large hydraulic reservoir sat right above two large hydraulic pump/coupling/motor combinations. The pumps were sandwiched between the reservoir and the floor, not to mention surrounded on the sides by the framework holding the reservoir. The pumps serviced critical production equipment that operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the maintenance group was unable to service and align the assemblies, it experienced the replacement of six $40,000 pumps in the last two years. Yes, I know, sometimes the obvious escapes us, or we don&amp;rsquo;t feel empowered to make the change, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different topic for another day. Interestingly, you can actually build in addition parameters to your FMEA to create an index for maintainability that you can sort just like the risk probability number (RPN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everyone recognizes that there is a cost associated with downtime. Equipment that is difficult to maintain drives less reliability and only serves to extend the amount of downtime required to restore the equipment to operation. Create an environment that has double vision &amp;ndash; that of both reliability and maintainability &amp;ndash; for a more comprehensive and effective approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/8LDObQPGlTQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Expert Tips for Planning a CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A well-planned and executed computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) project can yield a maximum return on your investment. This return is realized through increased efficiency, productivity and profits. However, a poorly planned and executed CMMS project can result in a loss of revenue. These losses can be measured in terms of the overall investment in the project, as well as from wasted time and lost projected revenue forecast tied to the successful installation and implementation of a CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Properly planning the CMMS implementation project is one of the key elements. In the planning phase, you determine the &amp;ldquo;what,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;why,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developing a plan for equipment data is a good first step because it will provide a CMMS with a foundation of hard, verifiable data. Some maintenance departments may already employ an equipment numbering scheme that is effective. This can easily be translated into the CMMS. If there is no scheme currently in place or if the current one is flawed, it is time to develop an equipment numbering scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determining an equipment hierarchy is the next step. This involves setting up parent/child relationships among equipment. For example, an air handler can have pumps and motors as children. If you are going to keep track of both the parent and children, the relationship must be documented. Make sure to include every piece of equipment that falls under that hierarchy scheme. Parent/child relationships also can be constructed for whole facilities. For instance, a building could be the parent with each floor a child. Each room could then be a child of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information on spare parts should be tagged to the individual pieces of equipment. This is referred to as the bill of material (BOM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, you need to decide what you want from your CMMS in terms of downtime monitoring. You should choose which pieces of equipment you want to monitor as well as how you want to track planned vs. unplanned downtime. Plan based on impact or loss of operation. You should have this information for each piece of equipment or at least for critical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Preventive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following decisions have to be made for each preventive maintenance (PM) task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM be performed by calendar time or run time (miles, hours, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM follow a fixed schedule (regardless of completion date) or a schedule based on completion date?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often will PM work orders be generated (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the strategies for route-based PMs? (For example, an inspection route for all fire extinguishers in a building.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Procedures can be preventive maintenance, safety instructions or any other set of instructions. Each piece of equipment should have identified for it all the preventive, corrective and predictive maintenance tasks necessary to properly maintain that equipment. Along with the maintenance task, information regarding maintenance frequency, responsible craft, repair and/or consumable parts necessary to compete the maintenance task, and time estimated to compete the task are some of the additional information that will enhance the usefulness of your CMMS database. These procedures can then be applied anywhere within the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need information on each maintenance technician such as name, address, phone, Social Security number, etc. You also have to decide if you are going to use some sort of ID card for your technicians that can be scanned by a reader. If you do, will the cards be produced in-house or by an outside vendor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following actions must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, you have to develop a part-numbering scheme. This is similar to the process used for equipment numbering. Some companies use a 20- to 30-character-long part-numbering scheme. It includes every detail of that part (i.e., type of part, thickness, diameter, location, etc.). With advances in CMMS and a field available for each of these details (category, dimensions, location, etc.), you don&amp;rsquo;t need a part-numbering scheme to include all of the details. It just increases the potential for data-entry errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implicit in the development of a part-numbering scheme is the need to concretely define the details of parts. The most useful in terms of work flow is defining the location of a part. Is there one or multiple stockrooms? Is there a location scheme within the stockroom (i.e., aisle, bins, shelves, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the data-gathering phase, you will compile a list of all the vendors from which you buy parts and services. One of them should be assigned as a primary vendor for each part. The CMMS automatically generates purchase orders to the primary vendors. This can be changed by the users if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this stage, you have to decide the criteria for selecting a primary vendor (i.e., price, delivery, overall service, etc.). Additionally, you should track vendor/manufacturer part numbers for cross-referencing purposes. You also need to decide the issue units that you are going to use (metric, British or a combination of both). How are you going to handle inventory of pipes, beams, etc.? Are you going to keep track of lengths? If a piece is cut, are you going to keep track of the remaining pipe length? Once vendor and tracking information is decided upon, you also need to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who has the authority to order parts and up to what amount?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Beyond what amount will further approval be required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the overall planning of the physical inventory process, you must make the following decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often are you going to take the physical inventory?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who is going to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is it going to be manual or using mobile technology? If it is manual, make sure your CMMS has the capability to print the appropriate forms for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Associated with this step is development of a parts label design and barcode label design. What information do you want to print on the parts labels? Part number, description and location are typical. If you are using barcoding with inventory, you have to decide which information items you want barcoded. Part number and location are typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have multiple plants/facilities, it is important that every facility follows the same schemes. Without consistency, the CMMS will not be very effective. If you are looking for a part at a different facility and that facility describes the part differently than you do, you may not find it even if it is in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Purchasing and Accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You likely will need the purchasing and accounting departments involved in the planning phase for these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Bill to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Ship to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales tax rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine budget accounts and amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should determine what plan and design codes will be used throughout the CMMS. During the planning phase, you need to decide on strategies for the basis of codes. Actual compilation of codes will be done during the data-gathering phase. Determine the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Account codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order type&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Action codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order priority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment criticality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purchase order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are employing mobile applications, you need to identify each application and work on articulating the details. Some examples include using a hand-held remote data-entry device to collect equipment meter readings, parts can be issued and/or returned using a hand-held device, hand-held devices can be used to count and track inventory parts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Decisions also need to be made regarding data backup. An articulated backup scheme should be formed that takes into account both hardware and setup. Determine how often backup will be done (daily, weekly, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan for the type of maintenance history you want to maintain. Your decisions should include date performed, task performed, the person(s) who performed the job, estimated and actual time to perform, equipment performed on, material used, and any outside contractor cost incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several decisions need to be made regarding the general operation of your CMMS. These questions provide information not only for planning but also for evaluating current capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are you going to print estimated time on work orders?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What details of reports are needed in your CMMS?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Which reports are needed in graphics format?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What decisions will be made based on reports analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Security issues: Who is permitted to do what?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field legends: Do you need to change the terms provided by your CMMS on any of the legends? If yes, be sure to document the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop a list of KPIs for your application. At this stage, you should review them and revise, if necessary. Also, determine how you would compute those KPIs. Most of the KPIs should come from CMMS reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assign Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan on who will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Install the hardware (if necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the computer hardware, backups, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform archiving and merging of data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take care of disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Generate reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review and analyze various reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan and schedule work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do the ongoing data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be responsible for customizing, configuring, tailoring and maintaining the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning stage of a CMMS is perhaps one of the most important in ensuring success. Granted, implementation itself is not a short process, but with a well-laid-out plan where all possibilities are considered, the process will be simpler and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The major challenge in planning a CMMS is considering the entire breadth of your operation down to every last piece of equipment, part and facility, and then remaining realistic with your goals. Consider the abilities of your operation to adapt to a new technology in a manner that will not unduly disrupt workflow. With a laid-out plan, you will reap the rewards for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/jZOu2G5HsJE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Reliable is Your Training?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/6/0c69b1b1-9abd-4184-8739-ac0dada8ec05_training.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 225px; float: left;" /&gt;Training is the backbone of preparation to perform the assigned duties in any position you hold. I cannot think of a single job in the world that does not require some kind of training to at least improve performance of the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The question then becomes, &amp;ldquo;What kind of training do I need for this job?&amp;rdquo; Throughout the years, I have attended and provided many different types of training, and every instance was different. Some training seemed lackluster and really did not provide much benefit for the time spent, while other training sessions were the winning ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does this have to do with reliability engineering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers have to deal with a lot of different failure causes, including the human-related kind. Many times the human-related cause of the failure is the result of a lack of training or improper training. Too often we just say that the technicians or operators need more training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe this is the same problem we are facing in other areas of our society. Just throwing money or, in this case, &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; does not necessarily solve the problem. It really comes down to finding the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sometimes reliability engineers do not have anything to do with training other than when it deals with &amp;ldquo;reliability.&amp;rdquo; In many cases, they do not need to be involved unless there is a problem with human-related issues. &amp;ldquo;Operator error&amp;rdquo; or other human-related causes are often overlooked or deflated until they become this huge looming cloud that can&amp;rsquo;t be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a reliability engineer, I think it is a good idea to have a place where you can note different cases of human-related issues and what the core deficiencies are most likely to be. From this information, the training can be adjusted to meet the needs of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some ways of using the information for training decisions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General or specific&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Informal or formal&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On the job, classroom or computer-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the training types are not equal, and just picking something because it is related to that area does not mean success. If there is no training that is related to the specific issues, then some investigation should be performed to identify proper training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In cases where there is already training provided, there should be a review of the training to verify it is the best and most effective training, and if not, what are the other possibilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers have direct input to trades, tools and parts requirements for the maintenance that must be performed. Why not have reliability engineers give direct input into the training that affects all of these areas?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/FcrJle22ues" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ensure Planning and Scheduling Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do you initially train someone new to the planner/scheduler position? First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the selection process, as I see this as an issue in many organizations. Ideally, the planner/scheduler should be one of your best craftspeople. You have to compensate the position at a level at least equal to your first-level supervision. The compensation should include accounting for the average overtime earned as a craftsperson if you expect them to apply for the position. You will not get many applicants if you are asking them to accept a significant reduction in their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to being a highly skilled craftsperson, the candidate should have good computer skills, a positive attitude, people-oriented and be self-motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you have identified the right person, the obvious next step is to get that person trained. You generally have a couple of choices here. You can send them off to a class, or you can host an on-site course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to another question. How do you help guarantee success with planning and scheduling? Realize that you can send a planner/scheduler off to training, have them return and, despite their best efforts, the organization will not allow them to plan and schedule work. Providing the on-site course will allow you to educate supervisors, team leaders, managers, engineering personnel, production supervisors, production planners and anyone else who interacts with the maintenance work management process. Now everyone can understand not only the roles and responsibilities of the planner/scheduler, but also their own roles and responsibilities in relationship to the work management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I teach maintenance planning and scheduling classes, I want to share a number of approaches. There are a several methods and opinions on how to plan and schedule work. What I find is that some groups actually do a disservice to their course participants by not sharing a comprehensive approach with various methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the initial training is complete, recognize that you are only one-third to halfway done. After about one to two months, it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring in a coach. Ideally, the coach is an external resource who walks a mile beside the new planner/scheduler. The purpose of this is to observe the activities of the planner/scheduler and also the interactions within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I coach and mentor, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to determine if the planner/scheduler is applying the items learned in the class. Are they creating job plans? Is the continuous improvement loop in place? Is the planner/scheduler focused on the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to see how the supervisors are interacting. Do they understand their roles and the planner&amp;rsquo;s roles? Are work orders being completed and data entered into the CMMS? Is the organization aligned for proactive scheduling? These are just a few of the items that I address in my coaching sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of coaching sessions depends on the organization. It may only be one to two in total. Now, about retraining, a number of organizations bring me back on a semi-annual to annual basis to provide an overall best practices health check as a good method to determine if the organization is continuing to mature in its implementation efforts. If it has gone stagnant, I&amp;rsquo;ll point out the obstacles and help get them back on the road to success. Ultimately, this is my primary goal. I have a passion for maintenance and operations, so I really care about people being successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not an external resource, someone internally needs to remove the obstacles to ensure effective planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With respect to retraining, you should always be in a state of constant learning. That means reading articles and attending events that foster learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a two-day maintenance management course in California&amp;rsquo;s wine country, I met a planner/scheduler who attended the course the previous year. At the end of the course, I asked him why he chose to re-attend so soon afterward. He mentioned that he had forgotten a number of items, and the main one was creating job plans. Wow! Besides scheduling the work, this is one of the most important parts of planning and scheduling. This example highlights the need for retraining, especially if you opted not to provide coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/uwGGjHxfRmU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Start a Reliability Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/584987f6-8c68-4688-bcfc-2ac8706122a8_start-reliability-program-3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 253px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;Where do I start? I have heard this question many times, and there is no easy answer other than &amp;ldquo;pick a spot.&amp;rdquo; What I mean is that normally when a company decides to start a reliability program, there are a lot of improvements to be made in other areas as well. I have never heard of a facility in which everything is perfect and the only thing they need to do is start a reliability program to become world class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is tied to almost every other area in a facility, and so when one area is at a low point, other areas are also suffering. I would call on all of the experienced reliability veterans to offer their suggestions to help those who want to start a reliability program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gather all of your best people, including the top people in production, maintenance, quality and safety/environmental. This group should have various levels of technicians, operators and management. The group should figure out the areas that need improvement. I do not only mean specific pieces of equipment, but all of the areas that affect reliability, such as training, scheduling, parts and tools. The list can go on, but the point is that you need to have a picture of the potential improvement to get some direction. The list of improvement areas needs to be prioritized so everyone can get on the same track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick the Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you know what needs to be improved, you can decide on the tools you need to start working. Sometimes the tools are already in the toolbox, which is great. If the tools are not in the toolbox, it is time to buy them. When purchasing tools, you want to buy the quality ones and not the bargain-bin tools that will fail to live up to the task. Some of the tools include root-cause failure analysis (RCFA), reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), fault-tree analysis (FTA), life-cycle cost analysis, etc. The tools are not all related directly to reliability either. Your different areas &amp;mdash; planning/scheduling, quality, custodial services, etc. &amp;mdash; can have a profound effect on reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pick a Champion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The champion must be a person who is committed to the job and the future goals. Far too often, this hat is given to a person who already has a few hats, and it ends up getting shelved at times. That can impede progress in moving a reliability program forward. The champion also needs to have the power and ability to make changes happen and influence the decision-making process. Responsibility without the ability is a recipe for failure. The champion is normally a cost in the beginning, but over time will pay for itself over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many more things you can do to start a reliability program, but this is a great way to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/7_GZ81tbmPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Waste to Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seems as if new weight-loss programs and products come out every week. One of the latest is a plastic wrap you place around your stomach. If you strap it around your stomach, you will sweat and lose weight. Brilliant! Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably sweat if you wrap anything air-tight around your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the more interesting thought is to wonder why we fall for this stuff over and over when we all know the basic concepts in weight loss, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less energy intake will reduce fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More exercise will burn fat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More muscle mass will increase metabolism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you know and understand these basic principles of weight loss, you can apply them and become very successful in losing weight. You will learn that it takes hard work to improve your metabolism and that it is a long-term lifestyle commitment, not a short-term project. This sounds awfully similar to reliability improvements, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Perhaps that is because both topics are maintenance, just with different equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is one of the newer concepts or buzzwords around maintenance. The lean philosophy encourages us to look at waste. What is waste in maintenance? Typically (not always), the largest waste is environmental and safety issues, followed by downtime of production equipment. There are also other losses such as damage due to catastrophic failures, wasted labor due to poor management system, high cost of parts and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key in the lean philosophy is to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do we reduce waste?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that we improve equipment reliability. As we all know, the key elements to improve equipment reliability are to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning and scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Spare parts management practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technical database&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Root-cause analysis practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering and design with consideration to reliability and maintainability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tools and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills development on all levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept &amp;ldquo;lean maintenance&amp;rdquo; and all other new reliability improvement concepts often provide interesting angles and viewpoints, but you will end up with the same answers. To be quite honest, there are new technologies, but not much new has happened with work practices lately. The list above has been true since 1972. The hard part is doing the things in the list, not coming up with the list itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is just another word used to convey doing the basics, but the angle is different. I recommend reading Shigeo Shingo&amp;rsquo;s classic book &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Principles of Lean Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; and applying the basic principles to reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/1GrkucLhNqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Maintain an Equipment Registry </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment registry is one of the most important tools in your kit when it comes to maintenance and reliability. It can be the foundation of your planned maintenance, lubrication, training and repair programs, as well as help with regulatory compliance and safety programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your spare parts management program depends upon a complete and accurate registry with the requisite analysis for regular service parts along with the insurance spares identified through failure modes and effects analysis. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that your financials are also tied in through depreciation, amortization and cost center assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment history gets tied to the registry along with manuals, drawings, procedures, labor costs and reports. That is why it is the foundation upon which so much is built, and that is why it is so vital that you get it right and work to maintain its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it has an initial cost and a maintenance cost, the payback can be significant and continuous, so make the investment even if you have to bump something else down the list. The man-hours that you save long term will repay your investment many times over. You can consider the downtime and spares savings as icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What the Registry Should Look Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have an enterprise asset management (EAM) or computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), you are already set up with specific fields in a database. Review those fields to be sure that they satisfy your needs and then examine the registry for completeness and accuracy. You may be able to rename some fields to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an EAM or CMMS with built-in equipment registry, or you are evaluating a program for your plant, then be sure that it provides a minimum number of data fields for the basic information you need. This is one of those cases where more is better. Of course, smaller plants can manage with cheaper versions of programs or even with simple spreadsheets if they are configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a bare minimum, you will need fields such as equipment name, manufacturer name, model number, serial number, location installed in the plant, description and date installed. You can add fields for service vendor, warranty period, capacity, functional location, superior equipment number, bill of materials (BOM) file number (if not included as a separate function in your software), and the original purchase order number if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is what you call it for your records. Make this understandable to everyone, and don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of abbreviations or acronyms if they are common to your process. You can form the standard here for your plant, so think about it up front. You will put this on labels, reports, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) screens, procedures, and work order titles, so it needs to have a structure that makes sense. A standardized structure will be necessary because you will also sort data like work orders by this name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Manufacturer Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and not the guy who sold it to you or installed it. List that outfit under the vendor name or in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Model Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This number connects you to OEM manuals and services, and works with the serial number to tell your vendor exactly which machine you are talking about when you call for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Serial Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serial number with the model number is very important information. With just the model and serial number, the OEM can usually pull up any information you need on parts and procedures. Verify that what you have recorded matches the actual nameplate on the unit. Some manufacturers maintain separate part numbers and drawing numbers for each serial number unit. Plus, there may be some subtle differences in your unit because of a special requirement that is only recorded in the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specific serial number record. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to order a $10,000 part, wait eight weeks for it to arrive and then find it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Date Installed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You use this date for warranty coverage, for depreciation financials and for setting up initial service and preventive maintenance schedules. It can also help managers decide if it is time to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is your in-house location code. Some large companies include country and plant codes on the front, but the basics are building, floor and quadrant. You can also use column numbers in the place of or in addition to the quadrant code to narrow it down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time when you establish your standard nomenclature for your equipment. It needs to be descriptive, standard and universally understood. Limit this to 40 to 60 characters for ease of sorting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment field is a free-form text block that you use to capture what the equipment does for your plant and any special information that you want available for use, such as the vendor name, unit capacity or anything else you feel is important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do it anywhere else, take this opportunity to record the design capacity and the machine&amp;rsquo;s relationship to other equipment (e.g., supply fan 04 for HVAC unit 03-03-12 with capacity of 1,500 cfm @ 5&amp;Prime;w.c.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of your equipment registry cannot be emphasized enough. Your technical training, spare parts, financials and work order systems all depend on accurate equipment records. Good records can shorten the troubleshooting times, facilitate training of new personnel, capture modification events, contribute to better management decisions by providing timely and dependable financial data, and increase reliability over the lifespan of the equipment. Couple these records with a labeling program and you can expect to enjoy good experiences with your installed equipment base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/qFExzFbYM4U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lack of Training Threatens CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Training for users of a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a multiple-phase process. There are three areas of training needs: basic training, application (CMMS) training and internal training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Basic Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure people who will operate the CMMS are familiar with computer basics and the operating system. If not, provide them with basic training so they are ready for CMMS application training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Application (CMMS) Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This can be done in two different phases &amp;mdash; initial training to get the system up and running, and advanced training after spending a period of time with the CMMS. Long training (five to 10 days) is not recommended, since most people forget the majority of the items learned. Timing of the training should be kept in mind. Don&amp;rsquo;t train too early in the day. Training should be coordinated with implementation. Trainees should leave the class and use what they have learned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Internal Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also need to train CMMS users with internal processes. This is often ignored in most CMMS implementation projects. Your software vendor will only train you on how the CMMS application works. You have to do the internal training yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, take equipment numbering schemes. CMMS users should be trained on numbering schemes to avoid erroneous data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another good example is inventory part description. If part description data entry is not consistent, you will find a corrupt inventory database after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work order data entry is another example. Descriptions such as &amp;ldquo;machine down&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t work,&amp;rdquo; followed by a repair description of &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fixed,&amp;rdquo; will not give you meaningful history. Therefore, proper and consistent job description training is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	General Training Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure that every trainee is given enough help to become comfortable and confident in what he or she is doing. Even a small shortage of needed training can cause an employee to backslide, lose confidence and eventually cause project failure. The new system cannot afford that. All personnel who will use the CMMS, maintain it or oversee its operation should be included in the training process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accept any and all training support from your vendor. You may wish to contract with your vendor for additional training support or follow-up training programs or services. Remember, while the training initially may seem like an expensive proposition, in the long run it will not only prove beneficial but also very cost effective.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training should be an ongoing process. New users should receive the full course, while current users should take refreshers as needed or desired. This continuity will accommodate the inevitable personnel changes and system evolutions that will occur over the life of the system. As users leave, their replacements must be trained as thoroughly as if they had been original users. This need is frequently overlooked.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		During the training process, the newly installed CMMS can be checked thoroughly to assure that it works as planned. Feedback from trainees should be recorded and analyzed to assist in evaluating system performance and potential modification. Action on trainee responses not only will result in system refinements but also will improve the general acceptance of the CMMS.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Employ Smart Redundancy for Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nuclear submarines are high-reliability designs that have redundancy built into them. Many of these systems are split into two halves (port and starboard), and each system has two pumps (a total of four). Each side could run fully on one pump. Then the two halves are cross-connected, so the entire system could run at partial capacity on a single pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of this redundancy comes at a cost &amp;mdash; about $1 billion in this particular case. Naturally, one of the comments I hear when describing these systems is that we could never afford such redundancy in our profit-making companies. I challenge that there is a place for what I call &amp;ldquo;smart redundancy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smart redundancy has to do with taking a critical look at your systems, looking at risks and searching for opportunities where a little redundancy may pay big dividends. Utility and packaging systems are ripe for this kind of review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One utility case in point is a fresh-water supply I inherited. After drawing the water from a well and treating it, a single pump provided the pressure to supply the entire factory. Failure of the single pump or its motor, electrical controls or pressure switch would shut down the entire factory within about three minutes. Depending on the failure, we could be down from 10 minutes to a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While we performed preventive maintenance on the components, the harsh environment of this pump still resulted in occasional failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some study, we decided to put in a second pump, with a pressure set point a little lower than the first. The pump cost us around $2,000; with installation and controls, it was a bit more. But the point is we never, ever shut down the entire plant again for lack of water, and we offset the entire cost by avoiding only a few minutes of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Packaging lines present their own problems. We often put 10 or more components in series (including the conveyors), and the failure of any one will shut down the entire line. Even if each component has a 97-percent uptime, the line will only perform at 74 percent (.97 x .97 x etc. for 10 times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have you experienced a time when an upstream component on one line was down at the same time as a downstream component on another line? Suddenly two lines are not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you could cross-connect the two lines somewhere in the middle, you could avoid some of these cases. That is sometimes as easy to do as designing a movable rail where two conveyors run together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t let the newspaper headline in your town read, &amp;ldquo;$2,000 pump shuts down entire factory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/otkPapUcR7g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>A Better Way to Buy Maintenance Parts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	During a recent maintenance-management seminar, the topic of purchasing cards (P-cards) being taken away for misuse almost created a riot among the group. One of the more frequent complaints from maintenance people is that they just want the parts to do their job right. While P-cards help enable this, they can be a curse at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, many organizations do not have a good partnership between the maintenance, materials management and purchasing functions. The illusion of a partnership exists, but not a real partnership. As such, maintenance uses the P-cards as a method to navigate around the difficulties of purchasing parts and materials through the normal channels. Face it: We enjoy the freedom of just running or calling down to the local supply house to get what we need. Needless to say, there are lots of issues embedded here, but let&amp;rsquo;s just focus on one part of the P-card curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we are using the P-card to navigate outside the normal purchasing and materials management channels, that generally means we are purchasing parts and materials outside the CMMS/EAM systems. While some groups have great procedures for getting P-card purchases into the CMMS, most don&amp;rsquo;t. For many organizations, here is how the process works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1) The maintenance supervisor shags the parts on the P-card. Maybe they get a receipt at the time of purchase or maybe not.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		2) Some 30 to 60 days later, they reconcile the receipts with the credit-card bill when it comes from accounting and charge it to a budget cost center in a blanket order fashion. I already hear some of you asking, &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this approach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem with the scenario above. The individual parts and materials along with their cost didn&amp;rsquo;t get charged to each individual work order. Talk about a lagging metric! It may be 90 days before we see the actual money spent hit the budget, so we are flying blind. Even then, we still don&amp;rsquo;t know the money spent or actual parts used at the individual equipment level. We might know an area at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Worse, we lost the opportunity to build our bill of materials (BOM) in the CMMS. Every time we buy an item, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t stock it, we should be assigning the item a non-stock part number, capturing the description, cost and sourcing information to link it to our equipment. It may be the only way we have to build the bill of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We need to get in the habit of buying everything through the CMMS, even if using P-cards to purchase. Doing this gives us the ability to build the bill of materials for our equipment. We understand the usage so we can make intelligent stocking decisions with materials management. We know our costs down to the individual equipment levels. We aren&amp;rsquo;t waiting 90 days to understand the cost of each work order. Furthermore, we can use our equipment data in the CMMS to determine where we are spending our money and see if we are having issues with types of parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that if you are using P-cards, make sure you have procedures that are audited and enforced to overcome the P-card curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/R1XSHJAI-FE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Enable Process Redesign and CMMS Success </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you desire to implement a world-class effective reliability/maintenance process in your plant, two sequential projects must be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, map/document the how, what, where and when of what is happening today &amp;mdash; not as the manuals say it is to be performed, but what is actually happening. This should be done with a facilitated team with full disclosure and comments allowed from all concerned. Avoid calling it re-engineering; it is an effort to gain full understanding of &amp;ldquo;today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team should be representative of the maintenance organization (include crafts and operations). This will take several months and should not be secretive. The working lives of many people are going to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much of the mapping tools come from total quality management (TQM). Some process flow charts and fishbones can cover the walls. What is being documented is the work order from inception to sign-off by the customer and archiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this process-management documentation will come understanding and buy-in that we really understand what we are now doing. Byproducts of the effort are suggestions on what the process should be and why. After the present is known, it will be possible to write objectives for the process we want to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, the team should design what they consider to be a world-class maintenance organization and how it would operate. Again, a skilled facilitator should lead this. New to the same batch of tools are brainstorming and negotiation. Remember, here is where work is being redesigned with impacts on all involved. It may be advisable to have a human resources person on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this comes a process-management chart defining the new process and, by the way, the information required to make it happen. Now we are beginning to define the requirements for our computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An interesting tool at this point is to get everyone involved in mentally walking through his or her workday as if the new process was in place. From this comes understanding and identification of training, roadblocks and a new language replete with openness of feelings and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now a plan of implementation can take place. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Remember, the most important employee in a process is the one who operates a machine or process. His or her skill makes it or breaks it. Who is the most important person when the machine fails? The maintenance technician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that a new process must provide actionable information tied to assisting the technician to perform world-class work and feel a bit of self-actualization at the end of the day. How does the redesigned process help him on a daily basis? If it does not, it&amp;rsquo;s back to the process design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a new CMMS is included in the planning, now is the time to complete the specifications and start the acquisition process. I doubt there is a CMMS that meets all the requirements, and there may have to be some modifications to your expectations. Just be sure to buy the CMMS that supports your process, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/fE4GQ7cklOw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Information Management is Key to Maintenance Performance </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Information management is one area that is often overlooked. It&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the more important areas, but it lacks glamor and excitement. It requires steady, regular and planned effort, so we naturally gravitate toward the areas that give us the periodic rush of adrenaline that most fix-it types crave. Unfortunately, if you ignore the benefits of information management, you get more opportunities to work long hours under stress to fight the fires and &amp;ldquo;be the hero.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My personal idea of a hero is someone who quietly and consistently does the unglamorous drudge work behind the scenes that prevents those breakdowns and lays the groundwork to reduce their effects when one does occur. This unsung hero grinds through the manuals, reads the spec sheets, peruses the trade magazines and spends hours asking the vendors questions about their products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our information hero then spends more hours compiling the information gleaned into usable formats and posts it where the supervisors and technicians can quickly find it when it is needed. The job of being the information hero is rarely recognized or rewarded, but it still needs to be done if you want to get the maximum from your technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all talk about wrench time and maximizing productivity, but achieving it is not an easy, overnight event. You go out of your way to find good people. You buy them good tools. You supply them with a safe work environment. You even try to get them some technical training. So why do you deny them good information that will make their jobs easier and improve their performance? No one does it on purpose, but again it is the drudge work that we all unconsciously avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is to get organized and get started. You may not be the right person for information hero, but look around your shop and see if there is a Superman hiding behind his Clark Kent persona&amp;mdash; someone who can and will grind through the necessary tasks for you. Once you establish guidelines, much of the work can be done by office staff, so don&amp;rsquo;t overlook those resources for the job. Administrative assistants are accustomed to managing vast amounts of information, so your maintenance and reliability data is just another format to them that they add to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your guidelines and framework should be simple, and the files themselves should be easily accessible by those who need the information. Something as simple as file cabinets married with a file tree on your plant network can work. I like to keep hard copies of manuals, drawings and some procedures that you can carry to the worksite or to the shop, so those go into a file cabinet. Each item should be labeled with the cabinet number and file name so they get back home. Add that to a file tree with folders and equipment files that are all in standard format, and you have a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Build your file tree based on functional locations, systems, process flow, alphabetical order or whatever makes sense to you and your people. (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to have a place for the generic stuff.) Use the names that are common to everyone or that you want to become common, and then label the equipment that way to reinforce it. Create some standard templates for master data forms, and you are in business to collect, collate and store information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have a master data document for each piece of equipment that acts as a gateway to everything you ever want to know about that piece of equipment. You put in all of the standard, basic information like manufacturer name, model, serial number and capacity at the top, and then add a short description of where it is and what it does. Insert links to other documents, and it acts as the doorway to all relevant information. You can even use it as an equipment history document for modifications, updates and special knowledge items that don&amp;rsquo;t fit anywhere else. The uses are only limited by your imagination. Keep in mind that human nature says that if it isn&amp;rsquo;t simple and easy to use, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once your troops see a value in it, they will use it as the first-choice place to look, so back it up regularly and review it at least annually to make sure the data is still relevant. There needs to be a mechanism for adding new info and comments so you get the experience of your techs available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about grammar or spelling, since you can always edit that later. If your CMMS or EAM system has the capacity for this function, great! If not, or if you are a small operation without those programs, this is a way to hang onto the data that can help. Even a link to a relevant original equipment manufacturer or service provider&amp;rsquo;s Web page may be the key to saving hours of downtime. Having the data and the links easily accessible saves the trips to the job site armed with flashlights where you try to read a nameplate that has probably been painted at least twice. When you stack the deck in your favor, this is one of the cards that you want in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/Xe8lgJjMXP4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reliability Begins with the Essentials </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s a really great documentary that shows up periodically on public television. It describes the building of the Boulder (Hoover) Dam on the Colorado River back in the early 1930s. (Like many, I was never really sure if these were two separate dams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was a project of truly incredible size at the time, one that needed and brought out some really innovative engineering, construction and logistical processes. However, there were some negatives brought out in the documentary. One of them being that if OSHA had been in existence at the time and visited the site, the project would have been shut down pretty much immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the work was incredibly dangerous. A premier high-paying job, for example, was lowering yourself by rope down the sheer 700-foot canyon wall, where the concrete would eventually bond to the rock, knocking free any loose rock that would affect the concrete bond (and, of course, avoiding loose rocks knocked free by your co-workers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(Contrary to the legend, though, no one actually ever fell into the concrete and was buried because the concrete pour couldn&amp;rsquo;t be stopped. This would have caused a serious flaw in the concrete, and quality of the concrete was a paramount focus of everyone working on it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/27/00de4234-a86e-46dd-aeb5-fc5a77547c3d_hooverdam.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;This sort of leads to the implication that in today&amp;rsquo;s world &amp;mdash; with the concerns and regulations about safety, environmental, fair hiring practices, etc. &amp;mdash; that a project like the Boulder Dam just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done at anything approaching a reasonable cost. The reality, though, is that in today&amp;rsquo;s world, this same project would be done faster, safer, better and cheaper (even in today&amp;rsquo;s dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similar thought about manufacturing. We all sort of know and feel that if we could just focus on producing units, cases, tons, whatever, and not worry about quality, housekeeping, paperwork and all that other &amp;ldquo;stuff,&amp;rdquo; just &amp;ldquo;get the job done,&amp;rdquo; we would get a whole lot more produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reality is the opposite, and we&amp;rsquo;ve all proved it to ourselves time after time. It seems as if it&amp;rsquo;s one of these lessons that we all just have a tough time learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We&amp;rsquo;ve convinced ourselves that we are just too busy or under too much pressure to take the time or apply the resources to maintenance, housekeeping, safety, quality, record-keeping, training, etc. Every single time, that decision has eventually come back to bite us much harder and more painfully than doing it right to begin with would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We feel we can make choices about these essentials, treating them as opportunities, and thinking we can apply some cost-benefit analysis to determine if they are worth doing. We forget that they are essentials and not choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	None of this is easy, as we all know. It takes creativity and effort to generate and explore options. But if there is no continued commitment to the essentials, and easy, quick, obvious, common-sense, business decisions are made to skip them, we will pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	None of this implies that we always accept and don&amp;rsquo;t push back and question the other &amp;ldquo;stuff.&amp;rdquo; We also have to find creative ways to get maintenance, housekeeping, training, record-keeping, etc., done in the quickest, cheapest, most effective way. One of the really great things about the North American worker is that he or she will always test the limits. Some will argue to the death; others won&amp;rsquo;t argue but just won&amp;rsquo;t do whatever it is unless they are convinced it has value. The most productive, efficient plants are always the cleanest and safest and produce the highest-quality product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We see this often with equipment. If a machine is ignored and allowed to become dirty, loose, misaligned and unlubricated, it begins to behave in an uncooperative, unpredictable, undependable, attention-demanding way (just like people do), requiring more and more of the attention of its operators. This prevents them from doing many other things and also forces them into more and more contact with the machine, raising the probability of more safety issues. Consistent product quality also becomes more of a struggle with an inconsistent machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If, on the other hand, a machine is treated well and kept clean, aligned, tight and lubricated, its behavior changes amazingly. It becomes dependable, predictable, reliable and capable of performing well without constant attention (again like people do), freeing up its operators for other improving activities that will increase productivity even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Currently working as a consultant, John Crossan retired after spending 30-plus years with the Clorox Company. His roles for much of the past 14 years were mainly focused on improving operations by fostering the installation and ongoing implementation of basic manufacturing and maintenance procedural mechanisms across 30 varied plants in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to Clorox, John also held operational and engineering roles with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the Burndy Corporation.

            <title>Meltric Offers Replacement Tip for Safety Switches</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/27/891ee731-fcad-4f9f-9d5e-9b1c78e6fb90_man unplugging power.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 225px; float: left;" /&gt;Meltric Corporation now offers Decontactor switch-rated plugs and receptacles for retrofitting obsolete safety switches that would otherwise be repaired or replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plugs and receptacles, which are UL- and CSA-approved for motor-circuit and branch-circuit disconnect switching, eliminate the need for expensive interlocks. They feature a switching mechanism that not only ensures contacts are electrically dead before the plug can be removed from its receptacle, but also the safe make or break of live connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Decontactor&amp;rsquo;s dead-front design provides safety when re-inserting the plug into the receptacle, as the male contacts do not engage the live female contacts until after they are fully enclosed inside the device&amp;rsquo;s arc chambers, thus preventing exposure to arc flashes even in short-circuit conditions. Any qualified employee can quickly connect and disconnect electrical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/27/65cf92ab-0208-4b77-a71a-17dbd9d3ea07_open safety switch.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 400px; float: right;" /&gt;Retrofitting an interlocked receptacle safety switch with a Decontactor consists of simply removing the safety switch&amp;rsquo;s original receptacle, installing an adapter plate on the safety switch and mounting the Decontactor receptacle onto the adapter plate. There is no need to bend conduit or pull wires to complete the retrofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any qualified employee can quickly connect and disconnect electrical equipment. The retrofitting process takes a minimal amount of time and reduces costs by allowing the continued used of the original safety switch, over-current protection and enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Decontactor&amp;rsquo;s heavy-duty casings offer excellent resistance in harsh environments, while the spring-assisted terminals prevent loose conductors due to strand settlement and conductor yield. Decontactors are available with up to five auxiliary contacts, allowing engineers to combine control and power circuits in one connection.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Autonomous Operator Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does autonomous operator maintenance mean? The &amp;ldquo;autonomous&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;me alone performing the maintenance tasks for which I am trained and qualified.&amp;rdquo; Is it something new? To those of us who knew cars before electronic ignition and computers, owning a car fostered a do-it-myself approach toward keeping it running. I always pumped my own gas, changed my oil and filters, and sometimes changed my belts. I could check the levels of fluids, read gauges and listen to the running engine for anomalies. Technology has given me diagnostic tools to at least identify engine problems. Prior to the industrial age, the operator set up, ran and maintained the equipment. The industrial revolution introduced specialists, and we redesigned the operator out of maintenance and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You say those are not operator duties? Why not? There are too many answers to that, which when really analyzed, cannot be supported. I cannot defend the indefensible. Rather than look at the &amp;ldquo;why nots,&amp;rdquo; how about looking at the &amp;ldquo;how can we make it happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The German Post developed new maintenance programs for several dozen new plants coming on line. For the preventive maintenance (PM) program, a condition-based computerized checklist would be mainly a column of step numbers and some performance annotations. The technician located the step number on the machine, and beside it were the instructions with pictures and adjustment limits. Essentially, it was a visual factory with the visuals in and on each machine. Operators were qualified to operate a machine based upon proper procedures, an ability to read performance indicators and maintain the material flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, the relationship grew between the operators and technicians to where operators could identify problems and, with the help of the techs, fix them. They also identified PM tasks that they could perform and did. All of this was done without management or operating procedures dictating them to do so. The operator and tech had joint ownership of the equipment. The visuals also helped the supervision to ascertain machine operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In several U.S. postal facilities, this happened in a similar fashion. It was not uncommon to see an operator crawling over a machine. However, when a &amp;ldquo;tie&amp;rdquo; showed up, things reverted quickly. Ties were people from outside the plant. What this did was free up the maintenance staff to work on continuous improvement and help monitor quality. How did management treat this? They indirectly facilitated it happening by providing guidance tied to several conditions, including safety of the employee and not to harm the equipment. Otherwise, they got out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How did this manifest itself in plant performance? It led to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved production and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced unscheduled absences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced grievances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cleaner plant floors and restrooms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors as coaches and resource providers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovations in maintenance programs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lower costs of performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Smiles at the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the late 1950s and 1960s, two terms came of age: work enrichment and work enlargement. These were used when discussing motivation and seen as ways to satisfy the higher needs of employees, as identified by Abraham Maslow. Today, they are considered to have the same meaning, which is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enlarging the work was applied to combining sequential horizontal tasks. Where there were four employees on an assembly, the work was redesigned for two, and some decision-making was incorporated into the work. It involved maybe building four models of the same unit, with the employee making decisions about parts and fit for the unique models from information for which he received training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enriching the work was a vertical enhancement. This involved W. Edwards Deming&amp;rsquo;s assignment of quality responsibility to the person doing the work, building a unit and then connecting it to a different unit using a different skill set, or a multi-skilled technician working on a hydraulic line on the wing of an airplane to allow him to open the skin, reroute electrical, fix the problem and close it all up. I ran into this at the American Airlines maintenance center in Tulsa, Okla., where the unions asked to be trained across craft lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both work enhancements are designed to give the employee some ownership and pride in a completed task where more than their brawn was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may want to consider how work was designed before the industrial age and assembly lines. What happened to the worker during the late 19th century and up to the mid-20th century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The role of Fredrick Taylor in his study of work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The tactics of the robber barons, which reduced the dignity of the worker to nil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The necessary role of the unions and the dignity of the individual&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Laws passed by our government that established rule of engagement for the adversarial relationship of unions and management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How that has affected our production, innovation and creativity into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in the late 1950s, real breakthroughs were made in the subject of motivation and improved dignity for the worker. Acceptance and implementation were (and still are) the issues due to the history of the industrial era mentioned above. Two Americans who had been rejected by their own country introduced redesign of work to the Japanese: Deming with his quality programs and Mary Parker Follet with the concept of the employee being a citizen of the company and what that means in the recognition of dignity and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This fit well into the Japanese concept of space or time. This redesign of the workplace was responsible for the manufacturing excellence after World War II. Deming got them out of the quality hole, and Mary set up the dignity citizenship of the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 1980s, the Japanese experience showed up in the U.S. with total productive maintenance, total quality management, self-directed teams, continuous improvement, kaizen, just-in-time and poka-yoke. All of that was built around the dignity of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that work and learning are integral requirements of our character. They satisfy a spiritual need. We were designed to work and to reap the benefits of accomplishing a task. We need accomplishments and challenges to keep us striving into the future. Work is only part of the life career. We should learn how to design and use it to enhance the other parts. I would hope that this is still a mantra for our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/71xZ9alEIAo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Productivity Inc. Sponsors TPM Manager Certification Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Middle- and top-level executives can now obtain certification in total productive maintenance (TPM) through a program sponsored by Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TPM manager certification program is designed for executives at any company interested in increasing process capability, improving equipment reliability and establishing a culture of teamwork, which are all critical components of an effective continuous improvement initiative.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;TPM enables a company to move from being a reactive to a proactive maintenance organization focused on preventive, scheduled and corrective maintenance activities,&amp;rdquo; says Maureen Fahey, managing partner of Productivity Inc. &amp;ldquo;Moving from fix and repair to equipment management provides the flexibility necessary to substantially reduce costs and generate additional income by increasing overall capacity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over four non-consecutive weeks, participants experience a series of learning modules. In between the weeks of training, they are required to apply the methods they have learned in class to operations at their own companies. Participants who successfully complete the four-week training and mentoring program, pass the certification exam and demonstrate successful implementation of the techniques in their own facility are then certified by Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;More and more organizations are realizing that corporate profitability is built on asset reliability,&amp;rdquo; said Ellis New, senior management consultant for Productivity Inc. &amp;ldquo;As a result, it has become apparent that the lean manager can&amp;rsquo;t do it alone.&amp;nbsp;There is a need for a counterpart to manage the improvement initiative from the equipment process reliability side.&amp;nbsp;The TPM manager fills this need.&amp;nbsp;Having both a certified lean manager and certified TPM manager will provide organizations with the synergy they need to really succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business also offer a lean manager certification program and a lean tool awareness certificate. The next TPM manager certification session starts Aug. 6, 2012, on the Ohio State University campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Maintenance Strategies for Special Tools </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We all accumulate special fixtures, lifting frames, carts, transport pallets and piping inserts that are infrequently used but save time and enhance safety when their time comes. What you do with these special tools in between determines whether you get that savings and safety boost again or if you have to make the same investment over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What kind of an investment? If you do the job infrequently, you have to retake the measurements, find the stock material, fabricate the pieces and verify the fits. None of this is cheap, and it usually happens in the middle of a job when you can least afford the time or diversion of labor. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously not cost effective to do it over and over again, so why not make the first time count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure that it will ever be used again, wait until things calm down and then evaluate the item. If it was a once-in-a-century affair, trash it and move on. If it looks like something that will be used again, record the dimensions and take pictures. Digital pictures can be inserted into or linked to a document for that equipment file or the file for that special job, and it helps explain the application of the item if you can take some pictures of it in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Color-coding your special tools is also a good practice. Pick a color scheme that is unique and make sure everyone knows that anything painted that color, no matter how much it looks like junk, is to be preserved and returned to shop storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labeling that special tool or fixture is another must, as well as its storage container. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen special tools painted a fluorescent yellow with numbers stenciled on them that were several years old. The yellow was their special color that was easy to recognize from a distance, and the number corresponded to a file folder that contained a scaled drawing, a detailed description and a step-by-step procedure on how to use it (with photos). Employees at that plant knew what the color meant and how to find the file on the specific item. They also knew that destroying or trashing a special tool was a termination offense at that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The good part about the unique ID number is that it allows you to reference it in work orders, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and bills of materials (BOMs). Add a designated, labeled storage spot and you get maximum value from your first-time expense. Another advantage is that if you have similar equipment at multiple plants, you can ship the tools or fixtures as needed and leverage the investment even further. This saves overall costs and increases reliability as jobs get done easier, faster and probably better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you manufacture equipment and you use special tools and fixtures during assembly, you may even open a new revenue stream by renting them to customers during major rebuilds or modifications. Just loaning them out for free builds customer loyalty and improves your equipment reputation for maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a simple, rare-use specialty item is one from my own past. We needed to move 3,200-pound grinding roller assemblies around every fall during mill overhauls at a brewery. This process involved going in and out of elevators, plus maneuvering through some tight doorways and passages. These assemblies could crush feet and break legs if they got away, and their awkward shape made them difficult to fit onto off-the-shelf carts, so it was important to have control of them at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our technicians initially designed an all-steel cart that ran about $3,500 each to have built, but after one of only two disappeared during a plant expansion phase, we went low-tech for the replacements. Our carpenter contractor bolted together replacement carts from 4-by-4s, three-quarter-inch plywood and heavy-duty casters with angle-iron capture brackets at the corners. The carts&amp;rsquo; wood protected the roller surface profiles, and the four swivel casters allowed for perfect control into and out of tight spaces. The low profile kept the center of balance low to minimize tipping concerns. The carts stacked for storage in a designated location until needed the next fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At only $800 each, we got six for the price of one steel cart, so that simplified handling the three rebuilt assemblies and the three old assemblies without the need for much handling during the job. Pre-staging was a snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lesson here is that a low-tech solution is sometimes the most cost-effective one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another key lesson is that you need to control your specialty items so that they are there when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine if it will be used again in your lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make a dimensional drawing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number, label and color-code it if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create a file for it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Include how-to procedures and photos of it in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Designate a storage location that is labeled and record it in the equipment master file.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Refer to it in your work procedures and SOPs.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>The Dirty Secrets of Total Productive Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Several years ago, a group called the Maintenance Excellence Roundtable met on the West Coast to present what it had accomplished during the previous year and where it was headed for the coming year. We were privileged to have Robert Williamson in attendance, and he told us a story that stuck with me, as this was the time of &amp;ldquo;empowerment of the workforce.&amp;rdquo; It is called the &amp;ldquo;White Glove Story.&amp;rdquo; I have added a bit to it to give you a mental picture of some of the action. When Williamson tells it in person, he does likewise, although the story comes from the real-life experience of one of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A manufacturing plant had several lines manufacturing the same products. Each had an operator, and several were supported by the same maintenance technician. The operator&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities were to operate the machine, and the maintenance tech was to perform maintenance, even some of what we would call adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The operator on Line 3 was Mike, and the tech was Pat. Mike ran the machines, and when Pat was not doing equipment maintenance, he worked on several bench projects. Pat was frustrated that he was not able to perform minor maintenance work, which he knew he could accomplish, and Mike was always behind on his bench projects. Mike put in overtime and was tired of missing his son&amp;rsquo;s afterschool activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/20/0c8a8a1d-0995-4d70-81db-2c1f0a7c7fc0_glove_300x200.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Quality of the final product required all operators to wear white gloves. When the techs touched the product, they also donned gloves. One day, Mike was watching Pat perform a corrective task and asked Pat if he could train him to perform those tasks, which they both agreed he was capable of doing. One thing led to another, and line production went up. Pat worked less overtime and did not have to climb the 25 steps to Mike&amp;rsquo;s work area more than once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a staff meeting, the plant manager, Mark, queried the operations superintendent, Don, about the increased production on Line 3. He was also disturbed about some smudges found upon final inspection. Don did not have an answer. Mark pounded on the table, &amp;ldquo;We run this plant, and I expect you to explain major fluctuations in performance.&amp;rdquo; They agreed that the industrial engineer (IE) would study the situation and report back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IE quietly observed the Line 3 operator from a distance and discovered the Pat and Mike show. His report to the plant staff meeting was that &amp;ldquo;We have collusion between the operator and the tech, where the operator is performing maintenance and the tech is spending more time on bench projects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Damn the maintenance make-work bench projects. Maintenance fixes machines and operators operate,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Mark as he pounded the table. &amp;ldquo;Does everyone understand that? The inmates do not run the asylum? Don&amp;rsquo;t fix it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don put things back in order. Production dropped to below the other lines, Pat took unscheduled absences (fishing season started), and Mark got behind on his bench projects and began refusing overtime. However, Pat and Mike were not to be deterred. They decided that Mike should have two sets of gloves and switch when he did &amp;ldquo;maintenance work,&amp;rdquo; then back to the other pair for &amp;ldquo;operations work.&amp;rdquo; Production went up, but they controlled it to appear that they were just motivated to do superior work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All went well until the stockroom sent finance a requisition for gloves. The buyer commented to the director about the unusual usage. He brought it up at a staff meeting. Mark stated, &amp;ldquo;We have more important things to discuss than gloves; the bigger question is possible theft. Get our new quality lady, Ispy, to track this down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ispy discovered that gloves were placed in an open bin near the break room and employees swapped soiled gloves for clean ones, if needed, when they took breaks. The next time the soiled bin was emptied, she went through it glove by glove to determine if the swaps were appropriate. All were equally soiled or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She then walked the floor and visited each line, questioning the operators. Mike knew the party line. Ispy then went to security and used the in-plant cameras to watch the lines. &amp;ldquo;They lied to me!&amp;rdquo; she exclaimed at the next staff meeting. Don became enraged as Mark became uncontrollable. Their solution was to begin an employee rotation, with Pat assigned to shop work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Total plant production went down as word of what Mike and Pat had been up to became known when Don held a town meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after, things had settled down, albeit production was still low. Mark attended a conference on total productive maintenance and total quality manufacturing. He invited the prime speaker to attend his plant&amp;rsquo;s off-site meeting in the Poconos. That was a revelation weekend for Mark, as his staff discussed the possibility of the redesign of the plant&amp;rsquo;s own work processes and how to change the line operations. The IE and Ispy quietly brought up the Pat and Mike episode. Mark jumped on it and said, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it. We&amp;rsquo;re going to institute that across all the lines. Don, set up a town meeting and I&amp;rsquo;ll tell them what we are going to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I&amp;rsquo;ll end the story here. You can mull the conundrum facing the employees and the problem the management team is building for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article is really about the dignity of the individual. How do we tap the creativity, passion, sense of accomplishment and social requirements of people to provide them a sense of self-motivation, acceptance, growth, recognition and maybe self-actualization? Quality, world-class leadership focuses on the &amp;ldquo;fifth discipline&amp;rdquo; of self-mastery and systems thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How could this whole story have been handled to access the discretionary effort of all employees and become truly an industry leader?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/1rx7K_th0Jw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Is Proper Torquing Part of Your Standard Work? </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/18/b15ddf98-5ac0-450f-b0ff-488449e442be_torque wrench.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Read enough original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommended procedures and you will notice that a common thread is proper torque values for fasteners. Many standard work (and standard operating) procedures in industrial facilities list recommended or required torque values for jobs like gasket replacements, motor alignments, bearing installations and gearbox rebuilds, yet we often see technicians performing these functions without torque wrenches on the jobsite. Availability and management reinforcement both play a major role here. Both need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Availability is the first to attack since you can&amp;rsquo;t very well require a technician to use a torque wrench if none are available. If you list torque values on your procedures but don&amp;rsquo;t have torque wrenches available, you lose credibility with your technicians. The impression is that the procedures are just paper and don&amp;rsquo;t have to be taken seriously. This can be very bad long term because you use your procedures to capture and promote good practices. If they are not read or followed, you lose the advantages of standard work and retained experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Easily accessible torque wrenches must be provided to get maximum value from your procedures. If you have good luck with shop tools returning home, a couple of each range should be stored where everyone can get to them. If they tend to grow feet, issuing a couple of wrenches to selected technicians may be the answer. A combination is probably the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The day-to-day activities like flange tightening can be handled by cheaper standard-range wrenches issued to technicians, while specialty jobs would list and require the use of more expensive calibrated wrenches. These should be tested periodically by the manufacturer to ensure proper torque on equipment with specific torque values required by OEM procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management reinforcement is the second part of the equation. Without management encouraging and requiring the use of torque wrenches, human nature says that it probably won&amp;rsquo;t happen. Most technicians take pride in their work and want to do the best job possible, so a little encouragement is probably all they need. That encouragement is making the proper tool available, listing the recommended torque values on the procedures and talking up the value of properly torquing fasteners. The enforcement part comes into play for the small percentage of technicians who don&amp;rsquo;t have that inherent pride of workmanship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/JuCWHMrGXzM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Ladders Enhance Safety, Reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/16/3e4bfc61-f7b8-4753-885c-da10b090e2f3_ladder.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Everyone can remember a time when they needed a stepladder to get nameplate data, but with none around, climbed on top of something nearby instead. As we become more aware of safety in all of our daily activities, this behavior raises a red flag. The opportunity for a slip and fall injury here is too high to ignore, and yet human nature says it will happen too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you consider the initial costs against the potential benefits, having enough ladders staged at handy intervals in your plant is a good return on maintenance dollars. You leverage those dollars by getting multiple advantages from the ladders, such as increased safety, better labor utilization and improved work quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety improves when technicians use the ladders instead of climbing on motors, oily gearboxes, handrails and unstable items to reach things. Even a short fall can break an arm, hurt a back or create a head injury. With the average lost-time accident running into the thousands of dollars, a few ladders can seem very cheap in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labor utilization improves when you aren&amp;rsquo;t using highly trained technicians to carry ladders around your plant. It also means that those same techs will take the time to tighten that dripping packing, change the flickering light bulb or replace that electrical cover rather than pass it by. The increased reliability frees up that labor to do more cost-effective activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work quality improves because your technicians can comfortably reach the job on a stable platform and take those few extra minutes that torques the flange properly, tightens the fitting that was leaking and replaces the cover that protects your expensive instrument from moisture. Improved work quality means more reliable repairs, fewer mistakes and fewer come-backs &amp;mdash; all of which cost money and use your scarce labor resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have trouble with ladders growing feet and leaving in the backs of trucks, consider lockable brackets with a common keyed lock. Each technician gets a key, and management reinforces the behavior of returning the ladders to their brackets and locking them in place to be available for the next time. Start small in the areas where ladders are used the most often and then expand outward from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you buy enough ladders, you will probably want to get them manufactured with your company name stenciled within the fiberglass coating to improve your chances of keeping them. Also, be sure to buy the 300-pound capacity ladders instead of the cheaper 225-pound models. Americans are bigger now, and the guy who is 250 to 300 pounds is much more common than in the past. If ladders are stored outside, remember that UV light can damage fiberglass, so placement is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/d0jM0NWmyMA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Can Maintenance and Operations Coexist?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most of us come from traditional plant organizations with an operations group and a maintenance group with their own supervisors and specialized skilled crafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the major European postal services decided in the late 1990s to make a change in their plant maintenance organization. In my own U.S. Postal Service, there had been talk for years of combining the operations and maintenance supervision and reducing the supervisory ranks. It is easy to say, but how do you do it? Be careful of what you wish for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They negotiated with their union to change the working condition of &amp;ldquo;supervision&amp;rdquo; (changes in hours, wages and working conditions are negotiated contractual obligations) to put the operating equipment technicians under the operations supervisors. In doing so, they split the maintenance craft workforce and established a plant facilities maintenance support function separate from the operations maintenance function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facilities function had responsibility for everything but the operating equipment. That included storeroom, custodial, HVAC, all the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and the computerized maintenance management system. Work order estimating was done by the facilities planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operations now had control of their own machines, both production and maintenance. The thought was to make teams that could work together and decrease downtime, better identify degradation sooner, and &amp;ldquo;keep the maintenance employees involved.&amp;rdquo; In mail-processing plants, there is considerable time spent by maintenance personnel on &amp;ldquo;area assurance,&amp;rdquo; of which operations wanted to take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article, I discussed the &amp;ldquo;enabling process design&amp;rdquo; and focused on the levels of effort and training required for making a change such as this in people&amp;rsquo;s lives. Rather than tell you the level of effort, I will relate several of the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The supervisors had problems communicating with the technicians and vice versa. The supervisor could add nothing of value to assist the technician when a piece of equipment was down and also did not know how to judge technician performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors tended to drift toward the operators and avoid the technicians until something broke down. Technicians felt they were subordinated to the operators and felt unappreciated. This led to a reduction of discretionary effort and creativity as it was not recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The area assurance was misunderstood, and supervisors were uncomfortable for appearing lax toward technicians and pushing the operators. Cooperation between the two factions was less than before the big change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The technicians felt disenfranchised, not really belonging. In maintenance, they had camaraderie, mutual support, management that championed them and a home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Issues arose over planned work orders between the technicians and the estimators, and between the estimators and the supervisors, with the supervisors trying to understand the now fragmented process for which they used to be a benefactor, but for which now had a part in completing the work order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was implemented one plant at a time, and it became evident that maybe a plant-by-plant evaluation should determine the readiness to attempt this change. It resulted in a decision that &amp;ldquo;one size does not fit all,&amp;rdquo; and that there could be two approaches: Leave some plants as they are and implement the new structure through a modified process to address the learning from the earlier-on plants. Some early plants reverted back. It also became evident that retrained maintenance supervisors may be more successful in managing a mixed team of operators and technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lessons are many in this story. I believe that planning for such a change must focus on the roles of each player. I am a believer in getting people to verbally walk through a typical work day as though they were in the new process. This should be done with teams of all involved. Not only should this be early on to beta test a concept, but should be carried forward for all employees involved in every installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are considering any kind of change, this story is a good beginning for facilitated training sessions on enabling change, along with all of the other process management redesign tools that quality and re-engineering bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/tKolmMvloUs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Link between Reliability and Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last year or so, the question of reducing the cost of reliability has been ever present. Many maintenance budgets have been slashed without due process or reflecting on the true cost over time. I recently attended a conference where this was a topic of conversation. Out of all the discussions that I have heard, the most effective statement was to respond to that request from a CEO or plant manager with the following question: &amp;ldquo;How much are you willing to reduce the amount spent on safety?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, not everyone makes the tie that reliability and safety go hand in hand. I am reminded of a letter that Dave O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, the CEO of Chevron Corporation, sent to employees where he said, &amp;ldquo;Reliability, like safety, is a critical element of operational excellence and requires our constant attention.&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability drives safety and vice versa. Consider that most accidents don&amp;rsquo;t occur when things are running smoothly and the equipment has a high level of reliability. Accidents occur when we fall into reactive chaos. When a packaging machine is no longer operating in a reliable state, lots of minor stops may cause an operator to reach into a running machine (bypassing the safety procedures) and remove jammed cartons or film. The moment of frustration may cause the loss of a finger, hand or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less spending on maintenance may result in more leaking piping or vessels. The operator gives up on keeping the floor clean. Now, not only are the pipes leaking, but the main process line is acting up. When the product piles up on the end of a main conveyor due to a neglected bearing, the operator makes a mad dash to clear the pileup. On the way, he or she slips and falls in the area where the leak has created a puddle on the floor. The spiral only worsens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge that we face as maintenance and reliability professionals is to connect the dots for our leadership. We have to elevate maintenance and reliability as a profession and not have it viewed as &amp;ldquo;a necessary evil.&amp;rdquo; Sure, it is one of the most controllable costs in a site. When you toss out labor as a &amp;ldquo;sunk cost&amp;rdquo; (X number of people to produce X number of widgets), the largest (and easiest target) is the maintenance budget. Most every other cost requires capital to influence (energy costs, as an example) or is fixed via contract (logistics, raw materials, etc.) or global pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it is one of the most controllable costs, maintenance and reliability can be one of the greatest drivers of productivity and reduced costs. This is done not by slashing the budgets indiscriminately, but by keeping the focus on reliability as a long-term investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So when you are asked by the CEO or plant manager about reducing reliability costs, ask if that leader is willing to reduce the organization&amp;rsquo;s investment in safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/pzxjojfQwI0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Best Practices for Maintenance Supervisors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I had the privilege of visiting a large pharmaceutical plant in North Carolina several years ago. It was in response to a presentation I had made on just what should supervisors be doing. My organization was undergoing a work sampling on our 2,800 maintenance supervisors to help us get a handle on what they were actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most managers felt that we had burdened the supervisor with too much administrative work and, as a result, kept them from being on the floor interfacing with operations, providing assistance to the craftsperson and evaluating reliability performance. I wondered if our supervisors comprehended the need for face time and what that meant. I personally needed to get a handle on what I was to define as &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were introduced to the plant&amp;rsquo;s maintenance management team and the dayshift maintenance coach. He had a team of 18 facilities craft persons who maintained the building and environmental equipment for a million-square-foot-plus facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He told about his work day. It began with a 15- to 20-minute team meeting in which updates were made on the day&amp;rsquo;s schedule and plant/corporate performance. Employees identified any unusual situations they envisioned, potential problems and lessons from their completed jobs. Time was always allotted for social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The coach reviewed operational impacts, what was planned for the next day, unusual activities for the following week and his expectations for the day. That was their only gathering for the day. The team went to work on their assigned preventive and scheduled work orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So far, I found nothing unusual, until I asked him about &amp;ldquo;face time.&amp;rdquo; What did this consist of? He replied that each team member was an important, unique person and that he spent at least five minutes a day with each of them. If he could, he tried to see each twice during the day. His job was to assure that they had the resources needed to complete their work. If he received a call, he would respond to the work site for face-to-face assistance. Using the daily work schedule and assignments, he worked his way through the plant, interfacing with operations managers/supervisors about scheduling and priorities and some personal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Face time was personal dialogue. It primarily was exchanges about children, sports, work impacts and other seemingly non-process items. Not so unusual, but this was the primary type of dialogue between him and his team members. He knew their goals in life, spouse&amp;rsquo;s and children&amp;rsquo;s names, some of their home issues, what was happening on the Fourth of July or this summer, and other &amp;ldquo;non-work&amp;rdquo; type stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He headed off our questions about &amp;ldquo;work progress,&amp;rdquo; saying that unless he had something pertinent to scheduling or planning, he seldom initiated that dialogue. If the employee wanted to discuss work, the employee started that conversation. The coach&amp;rsquo;s time was spent maintaining interpersonal relationships with his team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His members were the skilled experts, and he felt they wanted the respect that entailed. How did he determine progress against the work order? During their social interaction, he observed what had been accomplished against the PM checklist or planned work order and could pretty well figure the progress. (He had previously reviewed these documents.) If he thought they may be a bit behind and might need help, he could bring up that &amp;ldquo;Joe was ahead today and could come over to provide another set of hands.&amp;rdquo; Otherwise, unless the employee brought up an issue, the coach stayed out of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toward the end of our visit, several team members came to join us. We expressed our appreciation for their coach but wanted their take on his approach to &amp;ldquo;coaching&amp;rdquo; them. To a person, they expressed their gratitude for their &amp;ldquo;boss.&amp;rdquo; They felt needed, respected and trusted. If the coach had asked them how they were doing or if they needed any help, they would have interpreted that as interfering with their responsibilities. The coach was always available to them, if they needed him. They looked forward to his visit each day. They knew him first as a person and second as their coach who represented the company to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Would they take a higher-paying job at the competitor down the road? No way! Did we know that if an employee found a seminar, a conference, a course or a new tool, he was encouraged to pursue it with company money? &amp;ldquo;We have a responsibility to provide the best product we can. We enjoy doing that, and it is more than appreciated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their plant had been evaluated against similar plants on reliability and cost-effectiveness and was considered the maintenance benchmark plant for their company and several of their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now I had an example of &amp;ldquo;face time&amp;rdquo; that represented a best practice. It requires planned floor time with a set agenda. However, it is only possible with a plant-wide mind-set about the empowerment that employees would appreciate, having the pillars of maintenance excellence in place that supports supervisors as well as the team members, and providing the information, training and communication within an atmosphere of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/3iIrBWFhljE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Signage and Labeling can Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of signage and labeling is often underplayed or even ignored when a maintenance program is being discussed. Since we are visual creatures and the visual workplace is the direct application of this, we should take a few minutes to go over some reasons and applications for signage and labeling to get more attention in our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Signage can be for several reasons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regulatory compliance (e.g., personal protective equipment, arc flash, Department of Transportation placarding)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Access control, such as &amp;ldquo;Authorized Personnel Only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fire safety, such as extinguisher locations and fire exits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General safety (e.g., cautions about fork truck traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Behavior and training purposes (safety reminders and CPR how-to directions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labeling is usually more specific but is also varied in use. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Piping labels per ANSI standard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment labeling for the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storage location labels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Special tools and tooling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safety equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment set points and wear indicators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these and more play an important part in achieving your maintenance and reliability goals. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that one of the biggest factors in your success is your ability to communicate effectively with your operators and technicians. They need clear direction on proper behavior and actions. A few generic, half-hearted exhortations to &amp;ldquo;work smarter&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;work safely&amp;rdquo; look nice on the wall, but do they truly achieve their intent if they are not coupled with specific instructions? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It takes visible, useful and targeted information to let your people know what you expect from them. In exchange, you have to provide them the tools they need to make it happen. Proper signage and labeling moves your organization in the right direction and does so at a very reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a look around your maintenance shop first and look for the simple things like the safety posters, the grinder guard safety labels, the special tools storage labels, the fire equipment, oily rag storage, etc., that you could do right away. Then, expand out into areas that are under your control and start putting up the signs and labels that you can see are missing. Go to the various safety sites on the Internet and check your general vendors for what they offer for ideas. I guarantee that you will see opportunities for everything from flammable materials storage to pinch points, arc flash and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your piping labels are especially important if your process includes hazardous materials or high pressures and temperatures. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the directional arrows for clarity where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment labels pay off big time for your CMMS system and for improving the accuracy of your work orders, as well as assisting your safety program. Putting the identification number or code, a proper description and the power shut-off locations on the tag are the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ID number gets the work orders written to the right spot and ties together bills of material, standard operating procedures and lockout/tagout procedures as well as just about anything else your imagination can connect to that unique piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proper description gets everyone using the same name for it, and that reduces confusion. Everyone has run into the problem of the new guy who calls it a widget when you call it a whatsit. Save time all around and get everyone on the same page with a simple tag or label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Power source locations are a big safety item that could help to save an injury or equipment damage by directing people to the shut-off right away. Don&amp;rsquo;t pass up this opportunity to save time in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your operations partners will recognize the value quickly. Jobs are recorded more accurately, take less time and get done safer. Who could argue with that? They will want to get on the train with you and share in the good results. Plus, it is fairly cheap, can be done with in-house labor and can be spread out over months or even over multiple budget years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/YBG1BQgEFRc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Signs You are in the Real World of Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone who has ever done plant maintenance improvement work is inevitably accused at times of just not knowing what it&amp;rsquo;s like in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance. So, here are some of the things I remember from that &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You can&amp;rsquo;t ever get on the paging system because it is always tied up with people paging for maintenance help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel have to carry more than one beeper because one is always busy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel really need to work on their responsiveness because they have trouble responding to more than one page at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance personnel are constantly driving by in really fast yellow carts with bright flashing lights and sirens. (Some are actually dressed in blue tights with red capes.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone really supports the planning and scheduling of maintenance work, as long as they can get a one-day turnaround on their work orders.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The only maintenance scheduler who could ever come close to handling the job used to be a short-order cook.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people say, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll get to the PMs sometime, but we&amp;rsquo;ve just got too many repairs to make.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others say, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have time to keep the machines in good condition. We&amp;rsquo;re too busy with projects to modify them to make them work better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some people believe voice mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Some believe e-mail is the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Others believe they are the maintenance schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The maintenance backlog got to be so big that we made some real money selling it to a lumber company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone agrees that maintenance needs to focus more on strategically supporting the business, but from the discussions, that seems to mean that we need to be able to do emergency repairs faster.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People say we just can&amp;rsquo;t worry about the cost of an emergency repair. It&amp;rsquo;s like Jack Bauer says: &amp;ldquo;Whatever it takes.&amp;rdquo; The time to worry is at month&amp;rsquo;s end, when everyone is really excited about how far you are over budget.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are cab drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts from suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are limo drivers on permanent contract to pick up parts at the airport.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We have a couple of machines that vacationed in Hawaii on frequent-flier miles built up on parts air-shipped in for them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Everyone says it is just so much faster to buy a part than to try to find it in the parts room.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you really need a maintenance mechanic, you can usually find one on the receiving dock waiting for rush parts to show up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At any given time, there are more maintenance people trying to find or buy parts than there are working on machinery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had to expand the parts room so all the people looking for parts could fit in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is no point even considering anyone as a parts supplier who only delivers once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When asked about how maintenance is scheduled, people quote the &amp;ldquo;S*** Happens&amp;rdquo; slogan from the movie &amp;ldquo;Forrest Gump&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We don&amp;rsquo;t bother updating the weekly maintenance schedule since we never get any of the work on it done; it is always good for next week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We discussed whether it was possible that a machine could need so much ongoing maintenance, that it was theoretically never available for production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One of our mechanics works an incredible amount of overtime. We think it may be that he really can&amp;rsquo;t go home anymore, as his attack chihuahua doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People stopped using beepers for maintenance emergencies and went back to the audio paging system because it was too difficult to get that tone of frantic urgency across with more than just a hint of accusation on a beeper.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The police department keeps showing up asking about mechanics who left their homes days ago, telling their families they were just going in for a few hours to help out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our hardware bins are overflowing with really neat nuts, bolts and fittings that we&amp;rsquo;re sure are really useful for something, but we always seem to run out of the ones we actually use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The plant manager put in some low-priority work orders that he told us we could get to when we had time, but the maintenance manager said we better get them all done by noon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our planner is a great mechanic who really helps us find the quickest, best ways to do things, and always makes sure we have everything we need. We get a lot more done because of him, and avoid a lot of lost-time issues we would have otherwise. But managers keep asking why we&amp;rsquo;re wasting such a great mechanic on paperwork when he could be really helping with emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators have come up with a lot of small improvements that they need our help with, but we&amp;rsquo;re told we can&amp;rsquo;t waste our time on them since we really need to stay focused on the big issues, because that&amp;rsquo;s obviously where all the money really is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There was a role clarification meeting between operations and maintenance management, and it seems like the outcome was quite clear. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely their job to break the machines, and our job to fix them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We had some informal shared meetings between maintenance and operating folk to discuss current issues and, you know, it was really amazing how many things we actually agreed on as the right thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Whatâs Missing in Overall Equipment Effectiveness? </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the issues with overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is that it is an output process metric (speed performance x quality x uptime). It&amp;rsquo;s great as a process metric for measuring machine performance, but it ignores the resources consumed in the process. Given enough money, I can improve any or all of the factors and reach any machine OEE goal on which I am measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In past articles, I&amp;rsquo;ve pointed out the fallacies of equal weighting of the three factors of OEE and explained one plant&amp;rsquo;s efforts to make the cost impact of quality an impact on OEE by increasing a quality change by seven-fold. A 1-percent decrease became a 7-percent penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I submit that the rework cost was, therefore, rolled into the equation; however, it&amp;rsquo;s still a performance metric. OK, so what if it is a performance metric? Would this be a metric taught to a finance person, an accountant or the treasurer of your company? What meaning would it have? How does it relate to the resources (dollars) required to get it? If I were to mention miles per gallon, board feet per log, pieces per work hour or other outputs per input, maybe you would see where I am going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to the plant manager and say, &amp;ldquo;I want another mechanic for the &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; line; it will increase the OEE by 4 percent with a resulting reduction in unit product cost of 8 percent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have developed a new measurement that incorporates costs and OEE. I believe line performance should be tracked by this metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total costs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Cost per unit produce&lt;br /&gt;
	Units produced x OEE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new metric has just been added to your dashboard that will allow you to measure the effect of reliability change on the bottom line. I submit that even the finance types and the production types will understand this new use of OEE. If you change the input, you expect an output change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the formula, if you increase the denominator or decrease the numerator, the final cost per unit produced goes down. In this case, you saw the need to apply maintenance resources to reduce the need for operational resources of labor and/or materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, at a staff meeting, the industrial engineer makes a critical observation: &amp;ldquo;The two factors in the denominator are not independent variables. If I increase OEE by 4 percent, I would expect production to go up by 4 percent, thereby the cost per unit would drop by 8 percent.&amp;rdquo; The idea has merit, and we can begin to manage with OEE by recognizing the impact of each OEE factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The industrial engineer follows up with an alternative in which the unit&amp;rsquo;s denominator becomes the designed throughput and a constant. Costs are driven by changes in OEE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Total costs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;= Cost per unit produce&lt;br /&gt;
	Designed throughput x OEE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The staff meeting continues with enthusiasm from all attendees as the formula now focuses on the causes and costs of production. Yet we now have a metric that can be understood by the line personnel, top management and even the financial types. It has become a key performance indicator, recognizing that change comes from paying attention to the details. OEE is no longer owned by maintenance and operations; it is now capable of tying purchasing, finance and human relations to the production floor through understanding of costs driven by the OEE factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Think about it. How hard is it for you to justify an increase in maintenance resources? I&amp;rsquo;ll let you ponder its practicality. For one thing, it becomes a metric understood and useful to all direct and indirect plant functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/mlvuRhQKLso" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>LumaSense Introduces Dissolved-Gas Analysis Monitors </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	LumaSense Technologies Inc. has introduced a new line of dissolved-gas analysis (DGA) monitors that allow electric utilities to more effectively reduce outages caused by faulty load tap changers (LTCs) and transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new SmartDGA platform uses non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas-sensing technology and features a unique hardware design that reduces installation time. It is designed to help utilities achieve widespread condition monitoring across generation, transmission and distribution assets at a cost significantly less than traditional DGA monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first monitor in the new line, the SmartDGA Gauge, will be the industry&amp;#39;s first dedicated online gas monitor for LTCs. It requires no carrier gas, no frequent calibrations and can be retrofitted to LTCs to provide asset condition status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We believe a smart grid begins with an optimized supply network in the utility grid,&amp;quot; said Vivek Joshi, LumaSense CEO. &amp;ldquo;This means having reliable assets in the generation, transmission and distribution networks globally. The SmartDGA Gauge provides valuable information about load tap changers on a real-time basis, which is very important if we&amp;#39;re serious about bringing concepts like the smart grid to reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LumaSense also provides a range of fiber-optic temperature sensors used to monitor winding hot spots, as well as continuous thermal-imaging systems that remotely monitor substations. Utilities can deploy these technologies to predict and correct faults as part of a condition-based maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Use Checklists for a More Efficient Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years, I have spent much time in discussion over the use of checklists for equipment changeovers and startups in plants. I have explained, reasoned, rationalized, cajoled, appealed, beseeched, entreated, implored, pleaded, urged and even cried real tears in my efforts to get people to use checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it was great to see a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found (amazingly) that hospitals using checklists in their operating room procedures suffer a much lower death rate than those that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was glad to see the study, but my very first reaction on reading it was outrage, along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Operating rooms don&amp;rsquo;t routinely use checklists? What?&amp;rdquo; Hopefully, the study will ratchet up awareness and perhaps drive some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But experience has absolutely convinced me that there is something in the human psyche that fights back desperately against using checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We need to get things done quickly. Checklists will slow us down. We know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing; we&amp;rsquo;ve done it a zillion times before.&amp;rdquo; Even with the best intentions in the world, these just are not correct statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, we&amp;rsquo;ve found on packaging lines that any missed item on a changeover checklist cost us at least 10 minutes of lost time on startup. In several cases, it resulted in some significant equipment damage, and who knows how many other times there were damage- or safety-related near-misses. Settings that weren&amp;rsquo;t changed, bolts that weren&amp;rsquo;t tightened, clamps left loose &amp;ndash; all completely unintentional, done by people who had done it many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human memory just isn&amp;rsquo;t reliable enough, especially if interrupted to briefly do something else &amp;hellip; or perhaps someone has a question or needs a hand momentarily. Once the mind has changed focus, all bets are off on memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A weakening memory in our culture seems to be treated as a real indicator of diminished capability, a sign of oncoming senility, the dreaded &amp;ldquo;senior moments.&amp;rdquo; But human memory isn&amp;rsquo;t a reliable mechanism at any age. We all forget our keys or where we left them or &amp;ldquo;what did I come into this room to get?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen even the smartest, most capable people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with forget things when distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can understand why surgeons, renowned for the magnitude of their egos, would resist anything that seems to suggest a compensation for a failing capability. But why then have airline pilots (with at least comparable egos) accepted checklists for many years. (Well, yes, the regulations say they have to, but if you talk to them, they say they just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even think of operating without them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mike Thomas, an associate who was a Navy pilot and then a long-time trainer of Navy and airline pilots, explains it as just a part of flying. From their very first exposure to airplanes, pilots work from checklists, and a key part of the trainer&amp;rsquo;s job is training in how to use checklists, just as much as training in the actual functions of the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly in plants, we&amp;rsquo;ve found when individuals are trained to perform tasks using checklists, they tend to continue using them. The difficulty comes when someone has been routinely performing a task before the checklist is developed. Even if they help develop the checklist, it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult for them to begin using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, we always get the argument that for pilots it&amp;rsquo;s a life-and-death situation (surgeons, too), and the same rigorous practices are just not necessary (and not affordable) in industry. Yet, when we started using checklists, things always got better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The simple answer then is just to make it a requirement for people to use checklists, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t, then there are consequences. But if you absolutely insist that people turn in completed checklists, then you&amp;rsquo;ll absolutely get completed checklists, because that&amp;rsquo;s what you asked for. Nothing says the checklist was actually used like it should have been. Unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s the story behind much reported checklist use. The requirement was a completed checklist, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have looked in many files and seen many pristine checklists and preventive maintenance (PM) work orders without any fingerprints, smudges or stains, and wondered how people could manage to keep them that clean out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Americans historically are not good at mindless obedience, but we are quite excellent at mindful disobedience, particularly when someone tries to force us to do something for which we don&amp;rsquo;t hold much value. That&amp;rsquo;s the way people in this country are typically wired, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s becoming the case in most other countries these days. We always push the limits, and we don&amp;rsquo;t take much for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(You know just one thing wrong on that checklist, even a typo, negates completely the value of the entire thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also had to talk about different ways to use checklists. If someone has performed a task countless times, it&amp;rsquo;s not very efficient for them to go step by step through a detailed listing, checking off each item as they do it. In that case, it&amp;rsquo;s OK to perform a small group of related tasks and then check them off. But it is never OK to perform all the tasks and then check them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have counseled people, &amp;ldquo;Why do you want to stress yourself, taking the risk of forgetting something? Why even try to remember? Use the checklist.&amp;rdquo; This is all about getting equipment started up and running well, as fast as possible, not completing mental improvement exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who deserves more respect &amp;ndash; the person who uses the checklist, completes the changeover perfectly and the equipment starts up and just runs, or the person who manages to do almost all those steps completely from memory and then we burn time trying to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to win trivia games at home, maybe even compete on Jeopardy or otherwise exhibit incredible memory prowess, that&amp;rsquo;s great, but memory gymnastic demonstrations don&amp;rsquo;t help us with more effective, efficient equipment changeovers or startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a plant where the qualification requirement for operating a piece of equipment was to be able to change it over completely from memory. This was a big piece of equipment with way more than 100 steps in the procedure. I got blank stares when I asked why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, what actually works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The use of checklists has to be mandatory, beyond debate. Just like safety glasses, ear protection, lockout safety, etc., they&amp;rsquo;re part of the job. But it takes much more than law-and-order enforcement to get successful ongoing use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to work with people and train them to do the job using the lists. Then it&amp;rsquo;s a routine, essential part of the process, and they get over the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s something extra, that it&amp;rsquo;s slowing them down.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to actually be out there, making sure that everyone has his or her checklist and is really using it, and finding any issues with the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We found laminated plastic checklists and grease pencils worked best.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Changeover follow-up meetings can help determine where people are struggling with the checklists. Identify time loss due to improper use. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for improvement, not blame. Blame tends to get you back again to mindful disobedience.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You must have active, participative processes to continuously improve changeovers and startups that include keeping the checklists current and building ongoing ownership for them. It&amp;rsquo;s always amazing how ownership makes the whole process just so much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This means constant work for team leaders, supervisors and managers, but it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of their job. Most importantly, they themselves really have to believe that using checklists is the most effective, efficient approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Are All Equipment Factors Truly Equal? </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The traditional formula for overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) &amp;mdash; including speed, quality and uptime &amp;mdash; treated all three factors as equals and OEE as a measure of equipment effectiveness over a 24-hour period, assuming 24 hours was the required performance window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies have refined the calculation to fit the actual required performance window. Robert Williamson&amp;rsquo;s example was the window when a racecar was required to operate at peak performance. In your plant, it may be continuous operation for only one shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/3/13/cbccdd8b-0730-4831-ae23-54875c359ee7_Are all Factors Equal.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;The metric began to be useful as a plant-floor performance measurement and, from analyzing the three factors, an analytical tool to determine improvement opportunities. All three factors are really at the mercy of the operator, who is the most important person in the plant when equipment is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I submit that all three factors (speed, quality and uptime) are not necessarily one-to-one linear correlations. Does a percentage increase in speed maintain the same quality or a proportional decrease in quality? How about the relationship to downtime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly,&amp;nbsp;are the savings associated with a 1-percent increase in speed offset with the reprocessing costs of, say, a 1-percent decrease in quality? I found this factored into the formula by a plant that penalized the formula seven-fold for each percentage change in quality. In my question about the 1 percent, they had figured the quality-cost impact to be equal to seven times the savings of a 1-percent increase in speed. Therefore, the OEE formula was impacted by a quality change of 7 percent for each actual 1 percent in quality. Quality was indeed &amp;ldquo;job one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have you looked at the optimum OEE factors for your equipment in terms of costs associated with increases and decreases in the factors? In other words, do your total processing costs necessarily go down with an increase in OEE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have come to the conclusion that all involved must understand the impact of any change in an OEE factor in dollar terms. OEE for the sake of OEE can bankrupt you. Decide on the range of performance of each OEE factor that can be tolerated, and educate all concerned on how that was determined and the costs to the process from changes outside those ranges: rework, scrap, upstream and downstream performance, maintenance, consumables, work hours, overtime, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The biggest loss of continued games with OEE is the trust, confidence and morale of the employees. They are not blind to the effects of &amp;ldquo;increase the speed by 10 percent and we&amp;rsquo;ll get out quota tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/WlzpUB-VpN8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Selecting Reliability-Improvement Tools</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I started in maintenance, I loved looking at the tool catalogs and, of course, imagined how nice it would be to have one of those gigantic tool sets. You know, the tool set with something for every job. Similar to most of the other new guys, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to purchase that kind of tool set and had to settle for a much smaller one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, purchasing tools to increase my toolbox capability was based on need and understanding of the function of the tool. This proved to be a great way to learn how to use my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If in the beginning I was able to purchase the dream set, I probably would not utilize half the tools because I would find myself overwhelmed and sticking to the core tools I understand and only occasionally running across something that I might find a use for. That would have not been a very good investment. By investing in tools as I understand their function, I am able to get the most out of them, and they will get used because I am more aware of them being there by the &amp;ldquo;new toy&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management and improvement tools are the same way. It is easy to dream of having a facility with all of the tools working harmoniously together and being utilized to their fullest extent. The problem is this rarely happens. Most successful programs start with the choice of one or two core tools and then add on as function and need permit. This allows people time to get to understand the tools and develop habits that are effective in application of the tools. As time goes along, those people are better equipped to be able to adapt to more tools in their toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen many horror stories in the making of companies who think that throwing money at problems automatically makes them better and eventually leads to trouble-free bliss. Throwing money or resources at problems often causes more confusion and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of this is a situation where I watched a maintenance manager and a maintenance supervisor replacing buckets on a standard bucket elevator that would normally be a one-man (or possibly two-man) job. The problem was that they were being watched by two Class A mechanics and one Class B mechanic, who were providing the tools for the manager and supervisor to use. Inefficiency has no limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You might ask, &amp;ldquo;What is the right tool for me to start with?&amp;rdquo; I recommend determining what your biggest headache is and then finding the tool to fix it. The tools can range from standard management tools to advanced tools that are designed to deal with a specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing I recommend before undertaking a bunch of the other tools is a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This will provide a solid foundation for some of the other tools to be added later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another recommendation is to implement a reliability program prior to investing in predictive maintenance tools, because it may help you determine which predictive tools you need or want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/ZRYqYScl7a0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Mobius Introduces Machine-balancing Training Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced the release of iLearnBalancing, a computer-based training product that teaches maintenance professionals how to perform in-place dynamic balancing of industrial machines. The training is delivered by DVD or through the Web via the iLearn-online learning portal and is run on a personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The software is designed to provide complete understanding of the different types of unbalance, including static, couple and dynamic unbalance, as well as what is needed to correct them. It also offers ways to ensure that you are not chasing the wrong solution during the balance process, how to tell if a machine is truly out of balance and whether there&amp;rsquo;s another fault condition with similar symptoms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s iLearnInteractive product line, iLearnBalancing features extensive 3-D animations and simulators to make the subject more interesting and understandable. The interactive course is fully narrated, making it easier to learn. Simulators are used so you can experience the interaction between unbalance, rotational speed and phase, and how they affect the balance vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, machine balancing has been as much an art as it has been a skill,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;iLearnBalancing demystifies machine balancing in an easily understandable format so that maintenance technicians learn everything they need to be successful. A well-balanced machine experiences less wear and has a longer life cycle, thus improving your plant&amp;rsquo;s overall availability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>3 Ways to Achieve Successful Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is important to every manufacturing operation. Successful reliability requires communication, cooperation and coordination. To learn the importance of these three Cs, let&amp;rsquo;s examine how your organization is structured and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How much does unscheduled downtime cost and where does the responsibility for that unscheduled downtime lie? Is the unscheduled downtime because someone unilaterally decided to run to failure, or is it because the work request was in the &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; but not responded to in a timely fashion to preclude the unscheduled downtime caused by an unscheduled failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a competent operator know when there is an anomaly with the equipment? Since a good operator is a living, breathing data-acquisition machine, the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; In the state of normal operation, good operators are cognizant of anomalies in the equipment they operate approximately one-fourth of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A follow-up question that progressive, reliability-focused management should be asking is: &amp;ldquo;What is preventing the competent operator from communicating the impending failures of the equipment to the &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; early enough to develop good job plans, identify the needed materials and resources, and schedule the repair in a timeframe that reduces unscheduled, expensive downtime and instead allows a quality repair to be done at a time that minimally impacts productivity?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does a craft-qualified, ethical maintenance tech have a desire to leave his name on a less-than-quality repair? As with the competent operator, the answer to this question is another resounding statement, &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; Just as the competent operator wants to be known for producing a quality product at the desired rate, a qualified maintenance tech desires to leave his name on a quality repair that will not fail and be classified as a &amp;ldquo;maintenance-induced failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This leads to another follow-up question that management should be asking: &amp;ldquo;What is causing less-than-quality repairs?&amp;rdquo; Do the materials management personnel, storeroom attendants and purchasing buyers feel frustrated because the management-designed &amp;ldquo;system&amp;rdquo; allows them to be the scapegoat for obviously controllable, but voluntarily uncontrolled product loss due to unscheduled downtime? Yes. You either voluntarily control downtime or voluntarily allow it to happen in an uncontrolled manner. The controlled or uncontrolled downtime is in the system that management has developed or allowed to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is management&amp;rsquo;s mindset regarding efficiency and effectiveness? For example, take a NASCAR pit stop. Which is more effective and efficient &amp;ndash; a pit stop that is scheduled, albeit in a short timeframe, or one that just happens somewhere on the oval track? It may seem like a rather inane question, but consider what you allow to happen routinely in your production-centric environment. Do you try to milk the last bit out of your system, ignoring the fact that well-maintained equipment is much more reliable and productive than ill-maintained equipment? Perhaps you are merely hoping that your stock car will get seven more laps on those bald tires and that the telemetry data on fuel usage is inaccurate. If the tires don&amp;rsquo;t make the seven laps or the fuel telemetry is accurate, you may end up with zero points in the standings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Are your customers happy with getting the product that they contracted for, within specific parameters, delivered in a haphazard manner and time frame? You probably don&amp;rsquo;t accept transactions that way in your personal life. You expect the terms and conditions of the agreement to be met. The clients that purchase your company&amp;rsquo;s products expect the same fulfillment of their contracted expectations. If these expectations are not met for your customer, they will find another supplier because it is a competitive marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability is the answer. Just as you expect your vehicle to start when you put the key into the ignition and turn it, so you have the same expectations with your manufacturing equipment. A major difference between your personal vehicle and manufacturing assets is that your personal vehicle is probably only driven by you, whereas the manufacturing equipment is operated by a succession of qualified people. This takes us back to the importance of the &amp;ldquo;system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How is your system designed? Are the communication, cooperation and coordination between the support pillars of your organization functional? In assessing how well your plant stacks up on the three Cs, start by answering some fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being identified while they are small and not affecting the quality and quantity of your product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are problems being addressed in a manner that minimizes adverse effects on equipment uptime?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a mutual acceptance of responsibility and ownership between the operation function and the maintenance function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operations should do an excellent job in making the product, while maintenance should provide quality and timely preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM) and a well-managed and functional inventory in the storeroom, which is under maintenance control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both operations and maintenance must form a viable partnership of communication, cooperation and coordination of activities to ensure timely repair of identified malfunctions before minor malfunctions become catastrophic and affect productivity. There must be a realistic business case decision to manage between the short-term and long-term gain. You must be willing to take a short production loss now, in a controlled manner, scheduled at a time that minimizes the effect on productivity, rather than wait and take a longer, more devastating hit on productivity at a later date because you have chosen the uncontrolled path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be on a proactive, world-class path requires organizational functions to be mutually supportive, to communicate needs and observations, and to coordinate the effort, time, resources and knowledge necessary for mutual success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>People Make the Difference in Maintenance and Reliability Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people may have gravitated to the maintenance and reliability industry because of the desire to work with machinery. I was trained in engineering and understand how machines operate and work. Machines behave in logical ways. They all follow the mechanical and electrical laws of nature. Engineers are immersed in those laws in their years of schooling. People in the maintenance field thrive on knowing that machinery works and behaves in logical ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article for &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, I pointed out the thought similarities between an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety improvement effort and a maintenance and reliability improvement effort. The idea that zero injuries are possible is a key concept for any safety effort to gain momentum, but how does a plant or an organization really improve safety results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I have experienced over the past 30 years is a continual and steady safety improvement effort. In the early years, much of the emphasis was on identification and elimination of unsafe conditions. The focus was on the machinery and the physical facility. The elimination of unsafe conditions was a normal and comfortable task for many in plant operations, production and maintenance. It was easy to identify and fix defects in machines and facilities that could cause an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our efforts in these areas were successful and improved safety. However, we still experienced injuries. Many of these injuries were not caused by unsafe conditions but by the unsafe acts of our employees. As our organization recognized this fact, more work and concentration was put on preventing injuries due to unsafe acts. We have used various programs to improve our results in the past. Several of the programs used were the STOP program and TAKE 2 program, both created by E.I. DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past several years, we used a program that concentrated on people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors by enlisting these people in observing each other. These observations help remind everyone to think and behave safely. The emphasis was on changing the culture and attitude of the organization as well as on the people and how each person behaves. We have seen substantial improvement in safety results over the past few decades due to this focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similarity in leading a maintenance and reliability improvement effort and a safety improvement effort. Today, many of these maintenance and reliability improvement efforts are solely concentrating on the machinery. The program leaders may become enamored with the new technical tools that have exponentially become more capable and less expensive in the past 30 years. The condition-monitoring tools and precision-maintenance tools have dominated the industry&amp;rsquo;s attention in the past several years. Many others have focused on the analysis processes such as reliability-centered maintenance and root-cause analysis. All of these tools and programs are fairly technical and logical in nature. The tools and their application are very comfortable to maintenance and reliability leaders, managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Certainly, any effort needs to have competency in these technical skills. The need to understand how machinery operates, how it can fail and how to prevent failure is extremely important and foundational to any improvement effort. However, this aspect is the easiest part to lead an organization in the maintenance and reliability improvement effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe the most difficult but most beneficial aspect of leading the maintenance and reliability improvement effort is managing the change process in organizations. The behavior change process from a reactive state to a proactive state is a challenging transition. Leadership of this change process needs to focus on each employee&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. This certainly is not a comfortable action for most leaders. Employees must believe that machine failures can be prevented by proper design, operation and preventive maintenance strategies. This attitude change is facilitated by continual education on the fundamentals of maintenance and reliability principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, success leads the organization eventually to believe that zero failures are possible. When this belief takes hold, the organization begins to accelerate toward a true proactive state. Each person in an organization is important to enlist in this change endeavor. It happens one person at a time through various stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changing an organization&amp;rsquo;s behaviors and actions on a daily basis is one of the key areas that will accelerate the maintenance and reliability process. Are you and your organization&amp;rsquo;s leaders educated in change management principles and ready for this needed behavior change effort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/UGYixQBxbT8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What Can You Do to Advance Maintenance and Reliability?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In his inaugural address to the United States on Jan. 21, 1961, President John F. Kennedy presented one of his most famous quotes: &amp;ldquo;And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This simple statement was a challenge for all to get off the sidelines and not wait for others to accomplish things for you, but rather to volunteer and complete things that benefit our country. This challenge was needed at that time, but I believe it is needed even more today in our country. I also believe we can apply this idea to our present situation with organizations in which we are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this time, I have had many discussions with individuals in our industry, our organizations and the communities in which we live. I hear that we need our organizations to do this, we need our organizations to do that, and we just need all these organizations to do more for us. Many of the ideas are very good suggestions that require energy and resources to develop and implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To continue to meet the needs of the organizations in which we are involved, we need more volunteers and people to step up and do something or all of these suggestions will fail to address and solve today&amp;rsquo;s challenges, merely because they were never implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/27/bebce566-dbea-4914-9ecb-f534b40700b6_what-can-you-do300x200.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Today, I see a small, select group of individuals from leading companies who are involved in our industry&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Certainly I appreciate all of the effort, time and work these volunteers have completed and will continue to complete in the future to advance the maintenance and reliability industry and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I would like to give one example of a person who has worked tirelessly for many years helping advance the maintenance and reliability community. I met him nearly a decade ago as I became involved in development of the Society for Maintenance &amp;amp; Reliability Professionals&amp;rsquo; (SMRP) Certified Maintenance &amp;amp; Reliability Professional (CMRP) certification exam. I have become a professional colleague and a friend of this person because of my volunteer work in this organization over the years. His name is Jack Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As some of you may know, Jack has contributed many things to the maintenance and reliability community over his long career. Even though he was approaching his retirement, Jack continued to devote an untold amount of volunteer time on the certification committee called SMRPCO (SMRP Certifying Organization). I believe he was driven to ensure that this CMRP certification test was done correctly and with rigorous processes. His work, along with many others on this team, has resulted in a premier certification process for the maintenance and reliability industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jack&amp;rsquo;s commitment and the commitment of many others who volunteer inspire me to give the extra effort and time to these good causes. We continue to have ideas that need developing and energy to move implementation forward. We need more ideas that will bring benefits and value to our organizations and communities. All of these issues require energy and involvement from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, please consider getting involved further in your organizations and communities. Think about what you can do for your organization(s) to advance the programs, products and goals. You will find these volunteer efforts to be rewarding, and you will most likely have learning experiences that will help you grow in both your professional and personal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/AicUzSUFyIA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota Named Company of the Year by Columbus Chamber of Commerce</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/23/ae45e07e-5289-4fe0-acbc-a426f1933567_toyota award.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 179px; float: left;" /&gt;Toyota&amp;rsquo;s Columbus, Ind., manufacturing plant, Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. (TIEM), has been named &amp;ldquo;Company of the Year&amp;rdquo; by the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce. TIEM was presented the award at the chamber&amp;rsquo;s recent annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Toyota is very honored by this recognition,&amp;rdquo; said Toshiya Yamagishi, president of TIEM. &amp;ldquo;As a company, we are committed to enhancing our associates&amp;rsquo; quality of life and contributing to the overall success of our community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, the chamber bestows a number of awards of distinction in order to foster a culture of excellence. These awards recognize extraordinary contributions from the business community that reflect positively on the quality and expertise of the Columbus, Ind., community. TIEM was selected as the &amp;ldquo;Company of the Year&amp;rdquo; because of distinctive accomplishments that impacted associates, the community and the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chamber recognized TIEM&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The establishment of a recovery plan soon after Japan&amp;rsquo;s 2011 earthquake and tsunami that adjusted work schedules and allowed associates to continue 40-hour work weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TIEM&amp;rsquo;s zero-landfill facility designation achieved by shifting to a waste-to-energy facility and implementing recycling programs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The addition of new risk-assessment training, which resulted in a 65-percent reduction in safety incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The integration of a total plant maintenance program that reduced emergency repairs to just 11 percent of overall maintenance performed in 2009 and enabled the cost-per-hour of downtime to be reduced by 10 percent in the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TIEM designs, manufactures and supplies Toyota lift trucks and parts associated with Toyota lift trucks and tow tractors, and assembles motor vehicle parts and accessories. The facility, which was named a 2011 North American Best Plant by &lt;em&gt;IndustryWeek &lt;/em&gt;magazine, is a member of the National Safety Council, complies with the ISO 14001 standard from the International Organization for Standardization and has produced more than 400,000 Toyota lift trucks since its opening in 1990.

            <title>Achieving Zero Failures is Possible</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In his book, &amp;ldquo;Making Common Sense Common Practice,&amp;rdquo; Ron Moore of the RM Group explains that plant safety and reliability are linked and interrelated. He acknowledges that you can get better safety performance by solely focusing on improving safety practices (e.g., wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), implementing better permitting, using proper lockout/tagout procedures, etc.). However, Moore is also of the firm belief that best-performing plants are very disciplined about all their practices, and from that get a synergistic effect in all of their performance measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figures 1 and 2 show examples from a larger set of data that demonstrate the strong correlation between reliability (asset utilization capability) and safety (injury rate). This supports the statement that a more reliable plant is a safer plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/20/6c5c0f28-e997-44ec-93fa-8e0eeee232eb_zero failures2.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 302px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My experience supports Moore&amp;rsquo;s sentiments. I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced a significant change process with Cargill over the past 30 years regarding safety. We are in some businesses that traditionally have been considered not conducive to good safety results. It was thought to be impossible to keep people from getting hurt. We have found this to be untrue. More importantly, we have found that a change in attitude, leadership and actions were needed to achieve this. The culture progressed from one where injuries were part of the business to an attitude where &amp;ldquo;zero injuries are possible in any business anywhere in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our company&amp;rsquo;s safety progress has been a 30-year journey of improved annual results. These results are measured in a safety index number &amp;mdash; a proprietary calculation of reported injury frequency rate (RIFR), disabling frequency rate (DFR) and severity rate (SR). The lower the score, the better the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill&amp;rsquo;s safety index measurement has been used to drive better safety performance. We have seen the index decrease from 100 in the late 1970s to less than 2 today. Many companies now believe that a zero injury rate is a legitimate goal. It has become part of their culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that zero failures in reliability can also be achieved. In my travels, when I ask people if they believe if this is possible, most emphatically say, &amp;ldquo;No way.&amp;rdquo; They believe it isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, much the same way they believed 10 to 20 years ago that zero injuries would be impossible. Yet there are plants that have nearly achieved the goal of zero failures along with zero injuries. These plants have experienced many days and weeks where nothing fails unexpectedly. These sites understand all of the failure modes of their assets and their assets&amp;rsquo; current health. If and when a defect enters the asset, the defect is corrected early and failure is prevented. They are convinced that zero is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Experiences and data show that zero failures are possible. As someone once said, &amp;ldquo;If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re probably right. If you think you can, you&amp;rsquo;re probably right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/8icYjjQn08Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Keys for Improved Plant Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The people who work for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in airports know what it is like to be in a fishbowl. They always perform to an impatient, critical, assessing audience, as most of us are forced to watch them work for much longer than we want. Of course, if you&amp;rsquo;re just standing in line impatiently waiting, then observing and criticizing is really all you have to do (or you can talk loudly on your cellphone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of us standing there usually can identify some individual who might be better suited to another line of work. Some of the frustrated folks standing around me have been pretty obnoxious and verbal about this on occasion. There are, however, many TSA workers who clearly feel that they&amp;rsquo;re dealing with customers and try to make the process smoother, quicker and even friendlier for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This started me thinking about all the various plant maintenance and manufacturing assessments I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in over the years, and the success (or not) of the various improvement efforts tied to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After reading the book &amp;ldquo;How We Decide&amp;rdquo; by Jonah Lehrer, I was surprised to find that all of the supposedly rational judgments I thought I was making over the years were really mostly emotional. The emotional part of the brain is just tremendously more capable and can deal with vastly more information than the puny little rational part. I guess I started to realize maybe how I really was making these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Basically, the actual assessment really doesn&amp;rsquo;t take very long &amp;ndash; just enough time to walk around the place, observe and talk to some people. What takes time is compiling the evidence to support the assessment and using that for the discussions that help the plant build its improvement plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thinking about it, in judging a plant, the emotional brain is getting a fix on two things &amp;mdash; intensity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Intensity is the overall purposefulness that people display, a sense that they value their time and their function as important, and they need to do the most with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other would be respect in its many forms &amp;ndash; respect for the product, respect for the equipment, respect for the facility, respect for each other, respect for their customers, respect for managers and managers having respect for employees (an absence of &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;them&amp;rdquo; statements and behavior on both parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the places I always make a point of visiting is the plant washroom. This is where the overall level of respect (in its many forms) is pretty much immediately evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Going a step further, the intensity really comes from the respect. If you value what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, then you tend to do it well. If the value is not there, then doing it well is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third thing would be the work processes (or lack of them) that are in place. We can work all we want on the actual processes that just do the work, but if the intensity and respect are not there, the very best we can hope for is mediocre. However, if we incorporate feedback mechanisms into these work processes to routinely involve and develop people, then the respect and intensity will come. This is how we truly get on the road to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Currently working as a consultant, John Crossan retired after spending 30-plus years with the Clorox Company. His roles for much of the past 14 years were mainly focused on improving operations by fostering the installation and ongoing implementation of basic manufacturing and maintenance procedural mechanisms across 30 varied plants in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to Clorox, John also held operational and engineering roles with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the Burndy Corporation.

            <title>Reliability Reduces Waste of Time, Talent and Resources</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Waste is seen in many different forms in manufacturing. Some of these wastes include physical, time and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Physical waste is anything that is left over from the process that has to be discarded, recycled or sold. For every process, there is an expected amount of waste that is unavoidable. However, the waste that we will focus on is the excess waste that is produced because of equipment or process reliability issues. There are many processes that are a one-shot process, where if it is interrupted during the process, all of the materials become waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time waste also directly relates to equipment and process reliability. Any time that the system is down for unplanned maintenance, that means there is extra time required to make up the work, idle manpower and manpower required to correct the deficiency. In many cases, the extra time required to make up the work falls into overtime or extra shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Talent waste is the use of time and education to repair or correct process or equipment failures. There will always be the need for the use of talent to fix failures. The real loss is when the failures are preventable and nothing is being done to change the situation. The talent used to fix unnecessary equipment failures can be utilized to improve the process and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any angle from which you look at reliability will reveal that it is a necessary function to be a good steward of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/2PusA6Aoh94" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Get More Maintenance Work Done with Proper Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Famous financier Bernard Baruch was often quoted as saying, &amp;ldquo;Two and two still and always will equal four.&amp;rdquo; This, some would say, quaint concept has fallen out of favor more and more in recent years, as clearly the restrictiveness of basic arithmetic is not something that should continue to bind us in today&amp;rsquo;s brave new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s much more useful if two and two can equal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever analysts are expecting it to be (or better).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever your boss wants it to be.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Whatever will make this current project justifiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping this in mind, some odd-looking math that actually works in plant maintenance is the rule that:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This rule is a huge help with another rule that is always pretty much true:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In most plants, there are never enough maintenance people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I have 10 maintenance mechanics and the backlog just keeps growing, how can you get more maintenance work done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hiring more people is usually a long and difficult process, and always the longest, most difficult part is getting the approval (usually, rightly so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contractors are an option and will definitely get the work done (and usually best for specialized tasks), but they can eat up the budget pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overtime eats budgets, too, and also burns people out after not too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can also just beat on everyone to get more done, but that becomes counterproductive fairly quickly. Plus, since you&amp;rsquo;re typically working in a broken process to begin with, how much more can you really get done? Work ethic (except in a small number of cases) isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem. However, frustration can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or, you can just live (or try to), as many do, with the anxiety, excitement, frustration and consequences of not getting done what really needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But suppose you take your best, most organized mechanic and put him in a planning role, charging him and the group with using him solely as a resource to work with them to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the best, quickest way of doing a job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify materials, tools, etc., needed to do that job in the best way. This way, they can be prepped ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work with the supervisor (or scheduler) to build a schedule based on realistic resource times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This way, you get more done with the people you have just by not wasting their time. (Believe it or not, the majority of people actually like this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, many times the response to this proposal is a variety of colorful expressions, all unflattering and casting unkind doubt about various attributes and the heredity of the proposer. Milder ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;How can we afford to give up a mechanic to become a planner? There&amp;rsquo;s just too much work to get done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;You want us to take our best mechanic out of the workforce and have him do paperwork? Are you nuts?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But numbers that various reputable surveys have pulled together over the years typically and consistently show that the usual unplanned maintenance work setup results in an actual working time (or so-called wrench-turning time) of about 35 percent of the available time of mechanics. The rest of the time is spent in many other ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Traveling to and from the job site and various other places (maintenance shop, parts room, lunchroom, washroom, receiving dock, supervisor&amp;rsquo;s office, engineer&amp;rsquo;s office, production manager&amp;rsquo;s office, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waiting for equipment to become available (behind schedule because of an earlier breakdown)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determining how to do the job and what materials, etc., are needed (traveling to all those places above and consulting with them)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting materials (after you find them; if you don&amp;rsquo;t, then you have to go through your determining process again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting tools (unless someone else is using them or didn&amp;rsquo;t put them back, then you have a finding process)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Getting help when needed (traveling and consulting again)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tool cleanup (if you ever get done)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same surveys typically show that on a well-planned, scheduled basis, actual working time rises to about 65 percent of the available time with all the non-working time components being significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So if you convert one mechanic out of your 10 to a planner, you have nine mechanics working at 65 percent vs. the previous 35 percent. Thus, effectively you now have 16.5 of your current 35 percent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You just added 6.5 mechanics by moving to planned and scheduled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;10 minus 1 equals 16.5&amp;Prime;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Or, &amp;ldquo;Buy 1 and get 6.5 free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on this, how can you afford not to commit to a planner? Some would say, &amp;ldquo;Most of our work is emergency work anyway with no time for planning, so how can a planner help?&amp;rdquo; Well, the key is just to start.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There has to be some work being done in scheduled downtime, where there is some time for planning. Start with that. If you start to get the scheduled repair work done much faster and better (or even just close to the time you estimated) in the scheduled downtime, then amazingly you start to be able to get the preventive maintenance work done in the scheduled downtime rather than skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without PM inspections, there is no hope of getting away from a lot of emergency work. But with them, there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspections generate work orders for more non-immediate repair work that can be planned and scheduled &amp;mdash; work that you actually get done (and done right). Emergency work &amp;mdash; the most inefficient use of resources &amp;mdash; begins to go down. You then begin to start a cycle of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many other good things start to happen, too &amp;mdash; a major one being that you begin to get more credibility. That opens a lot of doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, dramatic reduction doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight. There is individual and group training, developing the process, getting acceptance and commitment to get the process going, and some system setup. But it does begin to have an effect very quickly. Just start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK. So you don&amp;rsquo;t get all of your additional mechanics right away, but you start to get some. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get the planning and scheduling system good enough to get them all, you&amp;rsquo;re still well ahead of where you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment I always heard after a planning system was in place was, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting a lot more work done.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how that helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasound World VIII to be Held in Florida</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound World, a forum for ultrasound technology, has been scheduled for May 14-17, 2012, at the Clearwater Hilton in Clearwater Beach, Fla. Entering its eighth year, Ultrasound World has grown into one of the top conferences for reliability and energy conservation. This year&amp;rsquo;s program will feature presentations and short courses by users of ultrasound technology and will cover a wide range of topics for condition monitoring and energy conservation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the presentations offered include &amp;ldquo;No More Equipment Failures! Can You Say That?&amp;rdquo; by Todd Fraser of Procter and Gamble, who will describe how his department dramatically reduced bearing failure incidents using ultrasound technology. The short course &amp;ldquo;Clean, Green and Reliable&amp;rdquo; will explain how equipment reliability delivers low-cost, energy-efficient assets at plants around the world. Other important topics, such as effective energy conservation practices and detecting and analyzing electrical fault conditions with ultrasound, will also be covered in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This conference continues to provide outstanding presentations full of useful content attendees can take away and use in their facilities,&amp;quot; says Doug Waetjen of UE Systems. &amp;quot;We strive to create an outstanding learning environment where attendees can network and share their experiences. The fact that the conference has grown over the past eight years and continues to bring visitors from around the globe, many of whom keep returning, is a testament to the quality of the program.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Solving Maintenance Problems with Mobile Collaboration</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/21/edf24916-8638-4e7f-a732-8a8464b52afc_Librestream in use.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 188px; float: left;" /&gt;Time is money. For companies with operations spread across the globe, delays in equipment maintenance issues or production line problems can kill the bottom line. If the most skilled engineer is located in New York or Detroit and the most important machinery is in Mexico or China, costs mount quickly when decisions are delayed. Typically, the expert (or a whole team of experts) would board a plane to go and try to solve the problem, causing further delays and incurring expensive travel costs. With mobile collaboration, no one leaves their desk, let alone the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Secure Mobile Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The standard form of video collaboration facilitates face-to-face meetings in video-conferencing boardrooms. However, for manufacturers, the heart of their business is often the plant floor &amp;mdash; where traditional video conferencing doesn&amp;rsquo;t reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the development of new mobile technologies, the opportunity for video collaboration has expanded. Manufacturers are now taking video collaboration outside the boardroom and onto the plant floor, to a supplier location or into the field where the problems are occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These mobile technologies generally include wireless video devices for use on the plant floor and collaboration software for the remote experts&amp;rsquo; desktops. Plant workers use the mobile device to share video, voice, telestration (i.e., onscreen drawing) and images with the experts who interact live through the collaboration PC software. Remote experts can also share images or pre-recorded videos to play on the touchscreen panel of the device. By sharing this visual content, the experts provide plant floor personnel or field technicians with visual instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many manufacturers, the plant floor operation contains competitive sensitive information. For this reason, cameras are typically not allowed on the plant floor. In many &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; 1,000 companies, potentially &amp;ldquo;rogue&amp;rdquo; video devices such as smartphones must be checked at security. New video-conferencing mobile devices overcome that concern by providing tight security over the wireless communication, media content and device usage. Security, encryption, authentication and even centralized administrator control have become tablestakes for mobile video-collaboration products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reducing Equipment Downtime on the Plant Floor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production equipment downtime costs can be staggering, sometimes as much as $3,500 per minute for an entire auto-factory line. Trying to troubleshoot an equipment problem through pictures via e-mail or waiting for an offsite specialist to travel to the problem site adds costly hours that can be avoided with mobile collaboration technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For one major consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturer, mobile collaboration now allows them to perform remote production-line equipment maintenance and repair. In the past, when a machine was down and the right engineer was not available onsite to troubleshoot the problem, downtime rapidly escalated. With mobile video collaboration, plant technicians can now show a remote expert the failed equipment, removing costly delays from the repair process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/21/d64ed5f3-b02a-4e32-ba7c-a3fb9a3be4ad_Expert at desktop.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 165px; float: left;" /&gt;Improving Repair Decisions in the Field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Heavy industrial equipment manufacturers face the challenge of servicing equipment around the globe. In some cases, these manufacturers are 100-percent liable for any downtime and repair costs associated with their equipment. Often, field technicians have significant decision-making power, and costs can escalate 10 times if the wrong choice is made in the field. With experienced field technicians approaching retirement, it is becoming more difficult and expensive to provide in-person coaching of junior technicians. Travel costs alone can range from $2,500 to $5,000 per trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For one industrial equipment manufacturer, implementing an enterprise-grade mobile collaboration system was the answer. They now can bring remote experts into key field decisions quickly, delivering a positive financial impact on the profit contribution of the contract. Previous attempts to diagnose field situations using home-grown solutions such as webcams and cellphones were unsuccessful. These solutions lacked the real mobility, interaction and detailed optics that enterprise mobile solutions delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Accelerating Product Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers also use mobile collaboration to streamline product development. Design reviews and first-run production samples are an ongoing part of standard communication between manufacturing locations including suppliers. Normally, team members would try to review e-mailed pictures and often have to travel to these locations for live interactions, introducing delays into the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead of travel, mobile devices are now kept at internal manufacturing facilities or shipped to major suppliers to perform live visual communication when needed. The camera optics within these mobile devices are so advanced that remote experts can see detailed design aspects where even a fraction of a millimeter matters. In some cases, third-party cameras such as microscopes or borescopes can also be attached to the mobile device to show the remote experts even more detailed visuals. By interacting live with suppliers on the plant floor, manufacturers accelerate product delivery, reduce travel costs and leverage scarce expert resources in their own company and that of their supply-chain partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers also use mobile collaboration with OEM vendors to perform acceptance test processes on new production-line equipment. The process was traditionally conducted at the supplier site. Multiple skill sets were required to adequately inspect and test the new production-line equipment, which equated to teams of people travelling to the supplier&amp;rsquo;s facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead of sending a team of people, manufacturers now send one person with the mobile collaboration device to stream video and interact with colleagues to perform the acceptance test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Network Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to consider infrastructure requirements for the mobile collaboration system. Mobile devices require either an Ethernet or wireless network connection to access the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wireless connectivity is the most common method used in facilities such as a manufacturing plant. The bandwidth consumption typically ranges from 250 kbps to 1 Mbps, depending on the existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For field-based applications, it is more common to see bandwidth consumption below 128 kbps due to narrow bandwidth backhaul connections. Even with only 128 kbps, mobile collaboration can include live video, voice, telestration and image sharing between the field technician and the remote expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another alternative to consider is the use of 3G or 4G cellular networks through mobile Wi-Fi hotspot devices such as the MiFi or Cradlepoint. By using a hotspot device, a wireless network can be created anywhere that offers adequate cellular coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile Collaboration Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the advent of mobile technologies, securely extending the power of video collaboration across an enterprise is now a reality. Enterprises are already experiencing the benefits of mobile video within manufacturing, including product quality improvements, production-line downtime reductions, accelerated product development and more effective supplier communication. Now, engaging in a full video collaboration session has become as simple as making a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Boeing to Close Wichita Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Boeing Company recently announced that the Boeing Defense, Space and Security (BDS) facility in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kan.,&lt;/span&gt; will close by the end of 2013. The facility currently employs more than 2,160 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The decision to close our &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita&lt;/span&gt; facility was difficult, but ultimately was based on a thorough study of the current and future market environment and our ability to remain competitive while meeting our customers&amp;#39; needs with the best and most affordable solutions,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Mark Bass&lt;/span&gt;, vice president and general manager for BDS&amp;#39; Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades division. &amp;quot;We recognize how this will affect the lives of the highly skilled men and women who work here, so we will do everything possible to assist our employees, their families and our community through this difficult transition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boeing Wichita is the base for the company&amp;#39;s global transport and executive systems business and its B-52 and 767 international tanker programs. The facility also provides support for flight mission planning and integrated logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past five years, contracts in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita&lt;/span&gt; have matured, programs have come to a close or are winding down, and the site does not have enough sustainable business on the horizon to create an affordable cost structure to maintain and win new business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In this time of defense budget reductions, as well as shifting customer priorities, Boeing has decided to close its operations in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita&lt;/span&gt; to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and drive competitiveness,&amp;quot; said Bass. &amp;quot;We will begin program transitions in the coming months, with the complete closure of the site scheduled for the end of 2013. We do not anticipate job reductions as a result of this decision until early in the third quarter of 2012.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Future aircraft maintenance, modification and support work will be placed at the Boeing facility in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/span&gt;. Engineering work will be moved to the Boeing facility in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/span&gt;. Although work on the KC-46 tanker will now be performed in Puget Sound, Wash., the 24 Kansas suppliers on the program will provide vital elements of the aircraft as originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boeing is offering employee assistance including retirement seminars, job search resources and financial counseling, as well as help finding jobs within or outside of Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Headquartered in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/span&gt;, Boeing Defense, Space and Security is a &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$32-billion&lt;/span&gt; business with 63,000 employees worldwide.

            <title>5 Time Wasters for Reliability Engineers to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the catch phrases. You&amp;rsquo;ve read the success stories. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the return on investment (ROI) calculations and the positive trending that reliability engineers bring. You&amp;rsquo;ve even lobbied upper management. Your argument has been so convincing that you&amp;rsquo;ve secured approval in this year&amp;rsquo;s budget to hire a reliability engineer. The hiring process has begun, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the results: more reliable equipment, fewer failures and increased availability and production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If only it were that easy. Building a reliability program led by competent professionals takes work. It requires setting expectations properly. Most of all, it requires time. How do you accelerate the process to ensure the maximum benefit in the shortest time? Avoiding these top five time wasters could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether your reliability engineer could have been a fighter pilot or whether he needs bifocals, although not being able to read the computer screen while reviewing an asset hierarchy certainly will slow one down. A lack of an overall vision for your facility&amp;rsquo;s reliability program is the No. 1 reason for inefficiency and wasted effort, not just in a reliability program, but with any initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before I became a reliability engineer, I worked as a project engineer improving equipment performance through sound engineering principles. I often was involved in maintenance engineering activities, troubleshooting equipment failures as they occurred in the hopes of getting the plant back up and running as soon as possible. My boss had read an article about the benefits of having a staff reliability engineer, and literally overnight the reliability engineer position was initiated. I was then asked to take the job.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What changed? The title on my business card and the signature line on my e-mails. I continued to perform the same maintenance engineering activities without any real strategic direction, for we had no vision of what we wanted our reliability program to look like.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I worked within my means throughout the next year to learn more about what true reliability engineering was. I learned the difference between a condition-based maintenance strategy, a time-based maintenance strategy and a run-to-failure maintenance strategy, which we had (by neglect) been practicing at our facility for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I learned that a smart combination of the three strategies is ideal, depending on the criticality of the system in question. I educated my boss, and he educated his boss. We learned that reliability best practices are well-established, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We also discovered that there are no shortcuts. For example, if you want accurate failure data, you need to have a computerized maintenance-management system in place. It needs to have an accurate hierarchy that represents the parent/child relationships that represent your plant or facility. The system needs to be populated by operations and maintenance with work requests, failure codes and material/labor dollars so that accurate analysis can be performed. Building an accurate hierarchy takes time and money, and there are companies that have done it before which can help make the process less painful. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of any reliability program, and like a foundation for a house, if done poorly will result in imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Master Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once there&amp;rsquo;s an understanding of reliability best practices, you need a plan that&amp;rsquo;s in line with the reliability program&amp;rsquo;s overall vision. Develop a clear methodology that can be understood at all levels of your organization. It should start with an assessment of current-state reliability practices &amp;mdash; where are you and your facility now in your reliability journey? &amp;mdash; as well as well-defined tasks that can bring your program in line with your vision. As with any good project plan, these tasks should have well-defined dates and persons responsible for completion. Resources such as people, money and time should be defined, and proper approval from site leadership must be obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Communication is vital to ensure proper expectations are set and maintained. For example, if site leadership doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that before maintenance plans can be developed and optimized, site hierarchy needs to be established and a criticality assessment performed, then they&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re working on in all of those cross-functional development meetings, all the while not seeing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prioritization of effort is a challenge we all face, regardless of industry or occupation. In this economic environment, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly asked to do more with less, and there are only so many hours in the day. Where and how we, as reliability engineers, spend our time is of utmost importance. The reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming: developing cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical equipment; conducting root cause analysis investigations to eliminate or mitigate repetitive failures; implementing effective corrective actions; developing and ensuring proper use of facility management of change (MOC) policies and procedures; identifying limiting factors that lead to high energy, utility, maintenance and supply-chain costs. This list could go on and on, but the question remains the same: where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You and your site leadership can determine where the priorities are and address the most critical items first if you have a well-defined vision, a master plan and the proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Measuring Stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you know how well you&amp;rsquo;re performing? Are you and the reliability program getting the results you desire? Are they in line with the overall vision set forth in your reliability program? How can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Waiting for the year-end numbers is like looking at the final score of a football game to see how your team is doing: you might get the information you want but far too late to make the necessary adjustments. A robust reliability program has a strong mix of both leading indicators, which tell you how you are doing day in and day out, and lagging indicators, which tell you how you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I wanted to evaluate the success of a facility&amp;rsquo;s predictive maintenance (PdM) program, I&amp;rsquo;d need to understand the number of critical assets under surveillance, whether inspections are performed on time, the percentage of identified issues that get entered into the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS), as well as the overall program costs, dollar value of saves and annualized cost per unit asset. Once understood, such metrics foster informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no sense in reinventing the wheel. Such indicators should be clear, concise and make sense for where you and your facility are on your reliability journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you know it or not, all of us are on a reliability journey. Just as there&amp;rsquo;s no job that goes unplanned &amp;mdash; even an unplanned job gets planned haphazardly during the execution process &amp;mdash; we and the organizations we support make decisions every day that affect how smoothly the trip goes. Proper alignment and planning can help you avoid the first three time wasters. Proper execution circumvents the fourth time waster, and proper control mitigates the final time waster. Comparison to industry-accepted standards shows us how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and how much farther there is to go.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Using Dynamic Electric Motor Monitoring to Identify Mechanical Issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic electric motor testing is often called on-line testing because it requires the motor to be running and generally assumes the motor is in its natural environment. Dynamic testing involves the connection of voltage probes and current transformers. Connecting dynamic test equipment is safe, quick and non-intrusive. Data is acquired and results are displayed in a summary format. The collected data is compared to the user-entered nameplate information and is presented in a pass/fail format with both current test data and trending logs displayed after each successive test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Motor Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every reliability technician knows that costs associated with motor failures can be devastating to any business operation. Finding that a motor is operating with conditions that create excessive heat or stress is a guide to the technician to make changes in the motor&amp;rsquo;s operation and to monitor its insulation. Knowing that a motor is in imminent danger of failing provides the technician with time to schedule repairs at his convenience rather than having the motor dictate to him due to a catastrophic failure. Reducing unscheduled downtime while increasing efficiency and profitability are common goals of all reliability technicians. Dynamic motor testing and monitoring is a relatively new concept aiding and advancing the capabilities of those responsible for the safe and continuous operation of electric motors and related equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What Dynamic Testing Tells You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor is one part of a complete system that includes incoming power quality, the motor and the driven load. Many motor problems are created by poor incoming power quality, and many more problems can be attributed to the load and load-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	State-of-the-art dynamic motor test equipment is capable of separating electrical issues from mechanical issues as well as defining power-related problem areas. Good test equipment will provide an enormous amount of information regarding the incoming power, including voltage levels, imbalances and harmonic content. A small amount of voltage imbalance will result in a much larger amount of current imbalance and increase losses within the motor. Harmonic distortion also results in wasted energy causing overheating due mainly to non-sinusoidal sine waves. These issues directly affect a motor&amp;rsquo;s performance and its ability to handle its load. Overall, poor power quality manifests itself as higher heat within the stator and rotor, reducing efficiency and eventually resulting in premature motor failures. Monitoring power quality and making necessary adjustments are essential in maintaining motor longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides power condition, dynamic testing provides extensive information about the motor&amp;rsquo;s behavior and offers evidence of potential mechanical problem areas. The test equipment tracks current levels and unbalances, load levels and torque-related information. Combining this data with the power quality information, the equipment can predict de-rating factors that indicate potential problem areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque and torque ripple add another piece of the puzzle that is required for consistent and accurate diagnosis of the motor&amp;rsquo;s health. Torque ripple is defined as the division of maximal torque divided by average torque during the acquisition period. The torque ripple itself is a measure of how small the torque band is that surrounds a steady state average torque. Torque ripple is independent of power condition and current level. It provides a visual look at how the driven load is performing and is an indicator of rotor stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing can identify rotor bar problems with a high degree of accuracy, and trending logs make tracking them over time easy and predictable. Rotor bar and cage defects result in lost efficiency and higher heat culminating in premature motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring and tracking efficiency is a very difficult task. The operating efficiency of a motor cannot be easily measured in a field application. Many standards have a number of requirements that commonly can only be fulfilled in a laboratory environment. These standards also usually concentrate on ensuring a proper description of a motor&amp;#39;s capabilities under good operating voltage conditions.&amp;nbsp;In the field, however, there is little room for requirements like uncoupling a motor or regulating the voltage level for a saturation run. Questions regarding a particular motor&amp;#39;s capabilities are found to be secondary in importance when compared to the operating efficiency under the given conditions in the field. The result of such an environment is that true efficiencies are unrealistic to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating efficiencies, however, are of crucial importance to an energy-conscious management. The requirements for a true measurement of operating efficiency in a field environment are ample and unrealistic (like installing torque transducers on the shaft of the motor and measuring the input power to the motor at the motor terminals, frequently at high voltage levels). Instead of true efficiency measurement, efficiency estimation becomes the only field-friendly approach for energy management.&amp;nbsp;The difference between operating efficiency measurement and operating efficiency estimation is that the former attempts to find the true operating efficiency via direct measurement, while the latter accepts a small measure of inaccuracy for severely increased user friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a controlled laboratory experiment, vibration analysis and dynamic data were acquired on a new 5-horsepower, 460-volt motor. The motor was disassembled, and the outer race of the drive-end bearing was intentionally damaged (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/85b88efa-0fda-4eda-bb53-3abb5bb64f99_Thomas Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 2px; width: 646px; height: 581px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor was reassembled, and new data collected. The common formula used in vibration analysis was applied to the data acquired, and the results were posted on both the vibration spectra and the torque spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resulting calculations concluded that the outer race defect should appear at 107 hz with sidebands related to the motor speed in the vibration spectra and twice the fundamental frequency in the torque spectra (Figures 2 and 3). The outer race defect with its sidebands was much easier to determine in the dynamically acquired data than the vibration spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 2. Vibration spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/ca95bc92-7bfd-4f73-b7d5-7a2437a8ea66_Thomas Figure 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 398px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 3. Demodulated torque spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rotor Bar Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another laboratory-controlled study, a 1-horsepower motor running under full load on a small dynamometer was tested thoroughly with the dynamic tester. The results were then saved and analyzed. The rotor was removed, and a 5/8-inch hole was drilled through one rotor bar, severing it completely. The motor was assembled and retested under identical conditions. Again, the results were saved and then compared to the original data (Figures 4 and 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/fc0da9cd-eb85-49ac-b2a9-1ecc3007d2cc_Thomas Figure 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 295px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/9551e808-da98-4f36-8547-487c25674ae6_Thomas Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 387px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broken rotor bar was clearly defined in the current signature analysis without any difficulty or intensive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cavitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a large electric power plant in North Carolina, mechanics noticed that one of three 15,000-horsepower pumps developed a lower flow level than the other two. The mechanics blamed the motor, while the electricians maintained the pump was at fault. Dynamic electric data was acquired and analyzed. Figure 6 shows the resultant torque ripples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/eb3b70c5-41ad-4096-85e6-85945db08a61_Thomas Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One pump displayed the large variations in the torque ripple, while the two pumps that were operating normally had the smaller torque signature. As a result of this testing, a diver was sent into the pit and found that the bolts on one end-bell had rusted off, allowing the flute that directed water into the pump to fall off. This situation caused the pump to circulate water outside the pump and created cavitation. Bolts on the other pumps were also in need of replacement and would have failed in the near future. The downtime required to make the repairs cost the facility several million dollars, but the increased productivity after the repairs easily compensated for those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, dynamic motor testing and the state-of-the-art equipment available today are rapidly becoming the tools of choice for reliability technicians worldwide. The technology is quite young, and new innovations are continuously expanding its capabilities and horizons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/n5rb3KB_7vY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Keys to Maintain Equipment Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is so much similarity in all that we do within the maintenance planning and scheduling world that compares to other separate and distinct functions. Let me explain. Borrowing from root cause analysis process methods, I trust you are familiar with Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams). These diagrams are one method that is used for product design, quality defect avoidance or variation, or to identify factors that lead to some event, hence the use in root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The categories typically include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man (people)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements to perform the tasks, including time estimates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: Any equipment, tools, etc., needed to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: Consumables, parts required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: Data generated from the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these items combine together to create some output or event. In the case of maintenance planning and scheduling, hopefully they combine to maintain or restore the reliability of equipment, as an example. See, in all we do, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that every product (i.e., maintaining equipment) is the result of a process. Let&amp;rsquo;s break them down individually for maintenance planning and scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man: People or staffing (which crafts?), skill requirements, number of people, contractors or vendors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: The job-plan task steps and sequence; items such as permits, manuals and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: What special tools (man lift, ladder, etc.) are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: What consumables or parts are needed to restore the equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: What do we need to know to improve the job plan? In the case of a condition-based monitoring task, we can take measurements to find something in the act of failing to allow planned restoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, all of these items roll up to complete the job plan and job package that should be created by the maintenance planner. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete all of these items, which three should I focus on first to ensure that I could drive craft effectiveness? From a maintenance scheduling perspective, I need the manpower requirements, estimated hours and the materials, but it can&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The only way that it&amp;rsquo;s effective is if I have a continuous improvement loop that relies on the feedback of the technicians to improve the job plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/f6HEKIkcHbw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Implement an Effective Chain-wear Monitoring Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Chain-wear monitoring has been a part of equipment reliability programs since the first link was forged. It is such an integral part of an organization&amp;rsquo;s reliability program that it has become part of industry slang as in the phrase, &amp;ldquo;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chains are a part of almost every industrial process. They are found in a plant&amp;rsquo;s material-handling transportation system, key components in the operation of hoists and cranes, or as a part of the connection that controls a safety stop device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of its function, the failure of any component that makes up a chain is costly to the owner, if not disastrous. Even though we would all agree that a chain failure is undesirable, modern industry&amp;rsquo;s chain-wear monitoring has remained varied in its approach and frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, chain reliability inspections are applied through a periodic inspection sampling procedure or replacement schedule. Visual inspections are commonly applied to the inspection of chain for wear identification, which is time-consuming to accomplish with tremendous dependence on the inspector&amp;rsquo;s experience, attitude and processing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technology exists that makes this costly approach no longer the only available avenue for chain monitoring to today&amp;rsquo;s maintenance departments. The application of infrared photoelectric optical systems allows for inspections that are more precise, less expensive and result in trending information to reduce failure opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/14d7ef58-7c4a-4cd4-a809-e78212ed9a81_figure1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 554px; height: 761px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Examples of worn chain pins identified through the use of an infrared photoelectric chain-wear monitoring system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Explanation of the Photoelectric Process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared photoelectric technology is utilized in many aspects of our daily lives without most of us even being aware of its existence. Examples of photoelectric detectors include the sensor components on the most advanced types of security systems, safety controls on door-closure systems for elevators and transit systems, and even as bottle fill-level monitors in high-production bottling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The applications of this technology are certainly vast and varied in nature. The basic principle relies upon an infrared light source (transmitter) that generates a pulsed IR beam to a series of infrared sensors (receiver), which in turn monitor that beam. The combination of the transmitter and a receiver is referred to as a photoelectric detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transmitter and the receiver are installed on opposite sides of the area to be monitored, and a signal is generated when the receiver detects obstruction of the pulsed infrared beam. A car headlight and a photocell could be used in a science project to create a very crude photoelectric detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of infrared light to this process is due to its increased receiver sensitivity and penetration. Infrared light is a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radio signals, visible light and X-rays. While infrared energy is similar to visible light and shares many of its characteristics, infrared energy is invisible to the human eye due to its difference in wavelengths. Infrared energy has wavelengths of 0.75 microns to 1 millimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The covers on photoelectric detectors are made of special materials that are designed to block out visible light while allowing maximum penetration of IR energy. This is what allows the use of infrared photoelectric detectors on a well-lighted factory floor or even in direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Historical Perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If most companies were to document their chain-monitoring programs, you should not be surprised to find statements such as, &amp;ldquo;Replace chain when conveyor malfunctions during production,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The last chain replacement was about five years ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s due.&amp;rdquo; Even what is viewed as a proactive program for chain-wear monitoring has historically used the method of choosing an arbitrary sample of a nominal 10-foot section of chain and physically measuring it for stretch, which would indicate wear. Obviously, there is a significant degree of risk in using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sampling plans are dependent on the sample providing information that is consistent with the condition of the entire system. Limiting inspection to a 10-foot section of chain within a 1,000-foot-long system sets up a situation where the likelihood of actually sampling the area of worst wear provides detection &amp;ldquo;odds&amp;rdquo; that even a Las Vegas gambler would find unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another concern is how accurately measurements are being produced when the measurement device is a standard hardware-quality tape measure. The historical alternative &amp;mdash; visual inspection of the chain &amp;mdash; can certainly identify chain wear, but once again can the production schedule tolerate the extreme downtime of such a labor-intensive approach, which needs a stationary chain to do an adequate inspection? Many types of chain are lubricated or painted, and those same coatings that protect chain from wear and corrosion mask typical wear indicators when performing visual inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last approach that is often used is that of periodic replacement based on chain age. This system of assuring chain reliability may help to reduce production downtime, but the cost of replacing reliable chain just because it is due can never be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Infrared Photoelectric Chain-wear Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared photoelectric instruments specifically designed for chain-wear monitoring typically use referenced technology to accurately measure the distance between the leading edges of each center link on the chain. With accurate link-to-link measurements, these monitors can easily identify individual links or pins that show signs of abnormal wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unit pictured below is a portable battery-operated device capable of monitoring all combinations of 3-, 4- and 6-inch chain. Alternate units are available that are designed for single-pitch chain. These monitors are capable of in-motion monitoring of chain to allow the inspection to be performed without disruption of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If permanently installed units are utilized, continuous monitoring of the chain can be accomplished instantaneously, identifying any chain links that exceed the programmed limits. Both status monitoring units and permanently installed units identify any link that is outside of preset size lengths through illumination of alarm lights identifying the specific problem area. Most units will provide the operator with options as to how data can be processed, including alternate avenues for monitoring, data review and problem-area identification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/1d98ce7f-a568-4fcf-85cf-1c4f1e0159f4_figure2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 484px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A portable infrared photoelectric chain-wear monitoring system mounted on a conveyor. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automated abnormality identification and marking systems identify each link that is above the wear threshold, and if combined with trend-analysis software monitoring, either periodic or continuous scanning will allow for planned replacement of chain only when it is truly needed. Trending software requires a defined start/stop point to enable accurate comparisons. This is usually accomplished through a uniquely identified link installed in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An option for start/stop link identification can be accomplished by permanently mounting a magnet assembly in the chain itself, which will automatically signal the unit to start and stop the data-recording sessions each time the magnet passes unit sensors. This option provides easily understandable data presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/69728b76-8d6a-4802-98b6-4fc351d51d22_figure3.jpeg" style="width: 518px; height: 1194px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;An example of reporting software showing a bar graph of link set measurements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several unique features that can be obtained from specially designed software allow for valuable analysis tools such as adjustable span length acceptance criteria, data-recording measurement ranges (individual link, individual link sets or 10-foot sections), trending overlay and charting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In normal usage chain, the majority of chain wear occurs at the friction points. The friction points are those areas where the pin engages the center link. Wear occurs on the center pin itself, on the inside of the center link or in most cases a combination of both. Manufacturers supply replacement growth charts that provide a value to determine the maximum length of &amp;ldquo;chain growth&amp;rdquo; that is recommended as a guideline for chain replacement. This is usually based on inspection data that is gathered from the commonly performed nominal 10-foot measurement technique. An example would be that a 10-foot section of new chain measured at 120 inches should be replaced when it reaches 124 to 124.5 inches in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A concern that should be recognized is that wear may or may not be evenly distributed across that measured section of the chain. The wear on one link may be much more severe than on an adjoining link. This type of condition presents the possibility of a chain on the verge of failure measuring well within acceptable tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The use of individual-link measurement technology eliminates this type of error, increasing the reliability of the inspection and reducing the risk of catastrophic chain failure. A scanning infrared photoelectric system provides accuracy within 0.02 inches. This is even more significant when the user recalls that this is being measured on in-motion chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/287cdb9e-bd2d-466d-97e1-44c97f5d244d_figure4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 484px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;This&amp;nbsp;system is&amp;nbsp;equipped with an automatic paint-sprayer marking system designed to mark individual links that are not found to be within acceptable tolerance limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Operating Personnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although operation of standard infrared photoelectric chain-monitoring systems is not much more difficult than the operation of a typical desktop personal computer, there are considerations that should be evaluated when operating this type of system. The first and most important is safety. Anytime personnel are required to physically work around moving industrial equipment, there are safety issues that need to be carefully monitored. At a minimum, safety training should include OSHA safety training and plant-specific safety review. Lockout-tagout procedures must also be followed to prevent chain movement during monitor installation and removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the type of unit being inspected, operator training needs to address powered chain unit operation (conveyors, cranes, lifts, etc.), unit installation, line walk-down requirements, software operation, file storage and recovery, and data interpretation. Often two-sided access to chain is not possible and may require sight cut-outs. This operation requires an individual who understands the load requirements of various types of units to prevent structural weakening of required supports. Since this type of inspection is reliability-based and is not a code, requirement acceptance criteria need to be established in order to provide useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of maximum growth tolerances requires individuals with experience in its development. Recommended training and experience may vary, but a good guideline would include 30 hours of classroom-style training covering all related subjects and a minimum of six months of hands-on experience before considering an individual qualified to perform inspections independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The utilization of infrared photoelectric technology to accomplish chain monitoring is a major improvement leap in this important part of a company&amp;rsquo;s reliability program. The cost savings alone justify the research as to the applicability of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent example of cost savings was developed by a meat-processing company that used the nominal 10-foot measurement technique for inspection prior to implementation of this technology. Over a two-year period, their incidents of breakdown were reduced by 100 percent (from an average of seven breakdowns per 12-month period to zero unscheduled breakdowns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was calculated that each breakdown cost the company $2,416 in maintenance repair costs, $3,765 in lost labor time and $1,184 in production revenue. The total cost to the company was $51,555 annually. Additional cost savings were realized in chain-life extension, replacement-part inventory reduction, planned maintenance scheduling and extended-chain replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is only one of many examples in which, if chain dependability is critical to plant production or safety of personnel, the utilization of individual-link inspection methods are self-funding in their application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/bVSc-Ay7_Wo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>6 Techniques to Error-proof Your Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When faced with the task of improving plant efficiency, the average plant manager breaks the task down by the five or six existing &amp;quot;departmental silos.&amp;quot; Each silo leader subdivides responsibility, repeating the mistake, and passes it on to individuals. As a result, we see young, intelligent engineers overwhelmed by the task handed to them of &amp;quot;get out there and improve maintenance.&amp;quot; The situation is not so bad for the less intelligent or those who have become automatons; they just keep repeating what has gone on forever and collect another paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	What the plant manager needs is a better way to visualize his situation, a method that will allow him to develop a new strategy. The following insights are based on work done at MIT and by many other professors in &amp;quot;human error&amp;quot; at international centers of learning. The &amp;quot;Error Pyramid&amp;quot; is unique, but the remaining techniques and technologies have been established for 15 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 1 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Most people are familiar with the triangle hierarchy of safety incidents that shows that for every fatality there are seven serious accidents and dozens of minor incidents; and below that, there are many hundreds of near-misses. By reducing the number of near-misses, there will be a corresponding number of minor and serious injuries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Taking the four main activities involved with manufacturing &amp;mdash; safety, reliability, quality assurance and operating performance (accuracy) &amp;mdash; each can be viewed as similar triangles. When placed together, they form a pyramid with a four-sided base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 2 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;People in each silo see their problems as unique and have little time or apparent incentive to work on the other guy&amp;rsquo;s issues. They do, however, use common primary methodologies for solving problems within each of them &amp;mdash; root cause analysis (RCA), cause and effect analysis, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), etc. In my many years of experience, I&amp;#39;ve seen that any change in one area affects the remaining three. In a very specific sense, I always see an improvement in safety and quality as reliability and operational accuracy improve.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Insight No. 3 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient manufacturers have small problem/error pyramids, while the less efficient have massive pyramids that overshadow everything else (i.e., the classic reactive mode of operation).&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The more errors and mistakes made, the larger the pyramid becomes. Alternatively, the more problems that can be solved, the smaller it becomes. Unfortunately, this is a dynamic situation, and even though people solve problems every day, the pyramid of problems never seems to get smaller. Insight No. 4 will explain why this is true.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; We, and the systems with which we surround ourselves, are the products of the human mind. They are by our very nature prone to make errors at a constant rate (see David L. Weiner&amp;rsquo;s books on the human mind). Therefore, having an understanding of how and why we make mistakes is critical to the task of reducing their frequency and effect.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4A &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody ever deliberately makes a mistake, particularly those working among a group of peers. As an example, football players often drop passes, but nobody does so deliberately.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the Number of Errors Made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is needed is to not only get better at solving problems but also to take some action that will reduce the number of new problems being created.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 5 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We need a &amp;quot;non-penal system&amp;quot; that allows us to recognize all the errors so that we can classify them by type and respond to the causes across the organization. Not surprisingly, you will find that 90 percent of the issues identified can be considered as latent or systemic.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many old systems were driven by veiled versions of &amp;quot;the beatings will continue until performance improves,&amp;quot; and we have seen just how ineffective this has been. As one director of manufacturing at a plant with an excellent error-proofing program said, &amp;quot;I can see the value of this non-penal system, but if the screw-up was big enough &amp;hellip; someone would still have to go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Let us assume that your company has one of the few problem-solving methodologies (RCA, etc.) that produces documented multiple root causes that also include the latent and systemic issues (even though the team is impotent in initiating corrective actions). What is next?&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 6 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Having achieved awareness of a primary issue, you need a formal program of error-proofing. The methodologies are applicable across all four silos, and the training involved should go a long way toward eliminating the existing silo mentality.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Developed in the aviation industry and rapidly adopted by the nuclear and health-care sectors, these techniques are saving billions of dollars each year. My experience is that using formal error-proofing techniques can produce some amazing improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/OoYrl8ccTiI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Reap the Benefits of Parts Standardization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nothing leverages your parts and training budgets like standardization. It is one of the key areas of the 5-S process. The more you can standardize, the fewer parts you need to maintain and the further your training goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some plants have dozens of manufacturers represented on their production floor with the subsequent glut of critical spares in the storeroom, shelves full of manuals and lost time while technicians re-familiarize themselves with troubleshooting procedures. It can also mean extra money spent on special tools, calibrators and handheld programmers, as well as maintaining extra vendors on file with the insurance, credit and shipping requirements that go with them. It takes some time and effort up front to establish standards, but the payoff can be continuous. The flavor of the month may be sexy and/or cheaper at the time of purchase, but you will probably pay for it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some simple guidelines to get you started. These are just a few places to look but may not be the place you want to start. Review your facility for problem areas and opportunities, then formulate your plan of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Check out your present equipment and look for commonalities like motors, variable frequency drives (VFDs), gearboxes, chains, sprockets, solenoid valves, PLCs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you are primarily a &amp;ldquo;one brand of PLC or VFD&amp;rdquo; plant, get your distributor to help you create a standard that leverages its stock. For example, if you use VFDs, consider standardizing on the largest horsepower-rated drive in each frame size. If the 30-, 40- and 50-horsepower models are the same frame, this range of drives can be consolidated into the 50-horsepower model. This means one spare in the storeroom instead of three. The cost savings can help compensate for the extra cost of the installed drives. Your distributor may only stock the largest horsepower size anyway and likely stocks it without a communication card. Follow his suit and leverage his stocking strategy for yourself. You also make emergency repairs faster and easier to manage, since the chances are good that you actually will have a spare available this way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEMA frame motors are dimensionally interchangeable, so look for the brands that work the best for you and consolidate your spares while specifying them for future installations. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work with manufacturers, but the old saying goes that you know you won&amp;rsquo;t get whatever you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for, so ask for it and see what the OEM says.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ISO dimension valves, solenoids, relays, etc., are also dimensionally interchangeable. Move this direction and you can use any ISO-compliant manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s product in a pinch.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Shaft couplings can be of different types and brands, so look for opportunities to standardize on the brand and type that serves you best. The local stocking distributor can make a difference if it stocks what you use and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for a replacement element. Check into standardizing on sizes, too. If a unit can cover multiple horsepowers, it may be cheaper to use it on all of those horsepower applications rather than stock multiple spares. The time savings can be significant if the techs don&amp;rsquo;t have to search for the right element.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PLCs are a good place to save some parts money. If you can standardize on a brand and format, you leverage your spares and your training.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ANSI pumps are like NEMA motors in that the dimensions from flange to flange are the same. Where it gets complicated is the repair parts for the power-ends themselves. Different shafts, bearings, seals, etc., can add up fast. If you can move toward a single brand for similar applications, you can standardize on power-end assemblies and seals. If you use both stainless steel and carbon steel shafts, see if the stainless steel will work in both applications. The price difference is not as big as you might think. Having several variations of the same size seal means more spares and more opportunity for misapplication mistakes. See if you can use a higher-end seal (like hard surface vs. carbon surface) for more applications. While it will cost more initially, you will have fewer spares in the system and won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about a tech putting a low-end seal into your aggressive product pump.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that your procedures are a great place to save time and money. There are lots of procedures available out there from OEMs, vendors and organizations that can save you time. Like the old saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Why reinvent the wheel if someone else has already done it?&amp;rdquo; This can mean anything from a standard inspection procedure from the Internet to a product-specific repair or replacement procedure from the OEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like most journeys, it starts with the first step. Decide to make the journey and then dive into the available information stream for help. There are plenty of folks out there to help you, so ask your vendors, peers, techs and contacts for suggestions. Then, you can look at your plant and seek out the hidden opportunities. Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost &amp;mdash; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/JmcU81BhM4o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Unleash the Power of Your CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A properly configured and utilized computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a foundational element of every successful maintenance and reliability program. However, implementing this technology by itself will not ensure that users will achieve greater efficiencies or maximum value from their investment. Trying to obtain value from technology alone is like trying to stand on a three-legged stool that is missing two legs. The other two critical items (legs to this stool) are well-designed work processes and engaged people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We as a maintenance and reliability community need to educate our management and co-workers on the benefits and potential value a CMMS brings to the entire organization, not just the maintenance department. Empowering and encouraging the plant staff to learn how to use this critical tool can pay huge dividends in improving plant performance and increasing the efficiency of maintenance and reliability programs. Through better analysis of asset failures, resource utilization and lost opportunity costs, a CMMS helps simplify the process of implementing value-added maintenance strategies that focus on failure elimination and risk mitigation on assets having the greatest impact on plant safety and availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also need well-designed work processes that focus on utilizing the features of our CMMS to document maintenance activities in support of the above-mentioned analysis with a strong emphasis on accountability to ensure consistent and accurate data entry is performed. Although inventory and spare parts management is an important integrated component of a valuable CMMS, this article will focus on the value that can be realized when the equipment and work order components are optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key point to remember is that the CMMS is only an enabler for an engaged work force utilizing well-designed work processes. You must consider and develop all three of these elements &amp;mdash; technology, processes and people &amp;mdash; if you want to achieve value from your CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	You Can&amp;rsquo;t Manage What You Don&amp;rsquo;t Measure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those of us who use our CMMS as nothing more than an electronic work order system are truly missing out on the benefits of capturing and analyzing powerful data that can be communicated throughout an organization to impact key business decisions involving the operations and maintenance of a facility. Any number of user-defined metrics can be supported by data extracted from a CMMS and then utilized by maintenance and reliability professionals as well as plant leadership to manage assets and resources (both personnel and capital) with the common goal of operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metrics can be designed to reveal things such as whether current maintenance strategies add value and are effective; the financial impact of asset reliability associated with equipment failures and lost opportunity costs; labor and cost data associated with particular plant areas, systems or asset types; asset failure history by asset type and cause of failure; or the number of reactive maintenance labor hours versus the number of proactive maintenance labor hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key to obtaining meaningful information from a CMMS is to define your objectives, consider the data that would support those objectives and build/edit field names and attributes within the CMMS that can be used to provide important performance data that reflect progress toward your established goals. Some common examples of attributes necessary to organize CMMS data for analysis include work type (corrective, preventive, predictive, etc.), work priority (1, 2, 3 or A, B, C), asset group (pump, fan, valve, etc.), asset type (centrifugal, vane axial, etc.), failure codes (bearing, impeller, coupling, etc.), as well as other key work attributes to address environmental controls, process safety management, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When configured with some of these key attributes, the CMMS becomes an essential tool in the documentation and analysis of equipment and work history that can improve our ability to identify and understand equipment failure and maintenance work-flow characteristics that significantly influence maintenance focus and strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are currently in a reactive maintenance mode, the ability to mine data from a CMMS that supports a simple Pareto analysis to identify at first glance on a macro level where the majority of your labor hours are spent (Figure 1) or where the greatest maintenance and/or lost opportunity costs exist is a solid first step. You can then follow up with a deeper look into the specific assets that are the major contributors and quickly drill down to the underlying causes. In the end, you can make more informed data-based decisions that will positively influence asset operating procedures, maintenance strategies, engineering designs or purchasing requirements focused on eliminating the observed failure mechanism and its negative impact on personnel safety and the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This simple and efficient analysis process is possible because we took the time to configure the CMMS in a manner that would support our desired objectives, define and implement the work process and data-entry requirements for work-order completion/closeout, and develop an engaged workforce through effective communications and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/5bbe3ad9-11f4-41c8-8282-4f439a850b5d_Figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 413px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having the proper attributes configured in a CMMS is also extremely helpful in measuring the performance of various areas within the maintenance work-flow process. For example, if you wanted to measure the overall effectiveness of your preventive maintenance program, you would need to consider what might be an acceptable goal and then look at how you would define the metric and data requirements to accurately measure performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, you want to consider work type and work priority categories to ensure you have the correct attributes to search or query from in the CMMS work history. A work type of PM (preventive maintenance) and CM (corrective maintenance) are required for this metric. You must then consider a work-priority scale that will differentiate emergent work orders that impede scheduled maintenance activities versus those that allow for orderly planning and scheduling at least one week in advance. You will also need to utilize the total number of labor hours required to complete these maintenance tasks as entered on their respective work orders when they were completed and closed out in the CMMS. You can then select your query date range for one month, one year, year-to-date, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PM effectiveness can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/a0262c71-b49a-4aa9-a925-934e82c6c4a3_Formula 1.jpeg" style="width: 634px; height: 97px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a query of the CMMS work history by work-order types, work priority and labor hours for the previous month indicated that there were 1,225 hours associated with PM work orders and 275 hours logged against emergent priority (i.e., priority 1) corrective maintenance work orders. With this information, we can then use the formula above to calculate the PM effectiveness for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/60cea7ee-a5cb-49d1-8037-8464a11dd63f_Formula 2.jpeg" style="width: 581px; height: 92px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This monthly PM effectiveness can then be factored into a cumulative year-to-date figure that communicates the overall PM performance for a given time period, i.e., year-to-date (Figure 2). This information is instrumental in measuring the impact of proactive maintenance strategies on reactive resource utilization. A lagging indicator at a macro level, this metric can be utilized to manage continuous improvement efforts that target ineffective operating and maintenance practices that have resulted in equipment failures and lost opportunity costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/5c163cc3-6d0d-4a25-8833-716021944cf2_Figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 347px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another example to illustrate the value of CMMS data, consider a safety committee that would like to report back to co-workers the efforts being made by the maintenance department to work off the backlog of CM work orders that are flagged as safety-related. A properly configured CMMS with a searchable attribute field designating the work is associated with the environmental health and safety program will provide an efficient way to capture estimated labor hours to determine the backlog as well as the actual number of labor hours spent performing work on these work orders. This will help communicate what percentage of total labor hours for a given time period was spent on safety-related work (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/199875fc-8b0e-48f9-96e5-ab5c5ca0076c_Figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 422px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assess Your CMMS Utilization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, there will be skeptics who see a CMMS as an unnecessary administrative burden that takes too much time for data entry and provides very little value when that information is already stored in their memory. Ironically, it is these same people who will inefficiently expend resources, sometimes two or more people and anywhere from one to three or more hours, trying to figure out what was done, how it was done, what spare parts were used or what was discovered the last time a particular equipment anomaly occurred. Even then, in some cases, less than adequate corrective actions are initiated on incomplete or inaccurate information as it was recollected from memory by those involved in the last repair activity that took place six months ago, two years ago or even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This inefficient method can be compounded by making costly mistakes that result in rework, additional lost opportunity cost and even more severe collateral damage than the original problem. Not only does this scenario reflect a poor return on investment in the CMMS, it adds fuel to the reactive maintenance mode &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; and could mean the difference between bankruptcy and being the lowest cost producer in a marginal market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, a CMMS can be an extremely valuable maintenance and reliability tool when you understand how it can be utilized to make your jobs easier and more efficient on a daily basis. It is critical that proper work documentation and closeout be defined in the maintenance work-flow process and its importance stressed to the plant staff responsible for operating and maintaining plant equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you are trying to investigate a particular equipment anomaly, measure and analyze your PM effectiveness or desire to improve maintenance strategies that directly impact plant availability and costs, all of these key business decisions rely on information. Proper utilization of a CMMS provides the means to access this information as a result of proper configuration of the CMMS and accurate, detailed and consistent data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a closer look at your CMMS configuration and utilization. You may be surprised at the untapped capabilities and power you find under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/yKeAW4c7EVQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Keep Maintenance in a Proactive Mode</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/31/c35d4bbe-c836-4011-b436-f9bc32ec68dc_sisyphus.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;I stumbled across some music trivia lately, that the old rock band Chicago finally had its album &amp;ldquo;Stone of Sisyphus&amp;rdquo; released a few years ago. One of the more famous &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; albums, it was originally recorded in the early 1990s but had languished for years, available only in illegal bootleg copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That reminded me of when I used to use the story of Sisyphus in maintenance training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I never encountered a great number of serious Greek mythology students in those sessions, but was always amazed how mythology suddenly grasped attendees&amp;rsquo; attention when I started telling about Sisyphus showing up in an episode of the TV series &amp;ldquo;Xena: Warrior Princess.&amp;rdquo; A statuesque, obviously very strong gal who always wore a brief, Roman-style leather outfit, Xena had a pretty fair following back in those days, especially it seemed in the typical plant maintenance group. (It was often brought up that the whole educational experience would have been much enhanced with video clips.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was a Greek king who made the mistake of getting the Greek god Zeus really ticked off at him. He supposedly did this by leaking stories to the press of that time about some of Zeus&amp;rsquo; indiscretions. So Sisyphus was sentenced to spend the rest of eternity &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; every day, all day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; laboriously pushing a huge boulder up a mountain. Then in the evening, he was to stand aside and watch it roll all the way back down to the bottom. Then the next day, he was to start all over again, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; summer, winter, rain, snow, hot, cold, no vacation, no sick days, not even Christmas (obviously) or New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sisyphus was pretty much a piece of work who had pulled off some pretty bad stuff himself, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really work up much sympathy for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So Sisyphus is still at it, somewhere out there, I guess, but you know he&amp;rsquo;s not alone. Keeping maintenance in a proactive mode can be a very similar pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we start out trying to get out of the frenetic &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, getting preventive maintenance inspections going, getting maintenance planning and scheduling going &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; that feels a lot like pushing a boulder up a mountain. (Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s probably harder. Sisyphus didn&amp;rsquo;t have people pushing back on the boulder as he was pushing it up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But as PM inspections get better and better, and people become more routinely conscious of equipment condition and get potential problems dealt with, and emergency work falls off, and we are getting better and better scheduled repairs done, the slope becomes gentler and it is easier to push the boulder. And the higher we get, the easier it is to push, and the air gets clearer, the sky gets bluer, the sun shines, the birds sing, the flowers bloom, we can see for miles, and maybe even Julie Andrews is running around up here singing something about the &amp;ldquo;Sound of Music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a while and some serious effort, we start to get where things start to run more smoothly. We can count on steady, decent production numbers every day. We don&amp;rsquo;t have aggravating breakdowns. We don&amp;rsquo;t have that routine, yet always unexpected, excess overtime that messes up people&amp;rsquo;s lives. (I remember the days of really hoping to make it through Friday without a disaster so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to ruin some people&amp;rsquo;s, and my own, weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we do planned repair work, we have pretty much everything ready, so it goes well and we get done what we had planned, pretty much how we planned it. We have a process in place where operations and maintenance folks routinely identify and analyze our problems and make permanent fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, it becomes really tempting to try to walk away from the boulder, because you know, it looks like maybe it will stay there by itself. It seems pretty secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe now we can start skipping some PMs. Maybe we can pull our maintenance planner for some other work. Maybe we can use our &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; maintenance resources for that project we can&amp;rsquo;t quite justify otherwise. Maybe maintenance doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to come to the production meetings anymore (there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many people showing up there now anyway). Maybe we just don&amp;rsquo;t need to demonstrate that much commitment to routine maintenance anymore. It seems to be pretty much a non-issue now, and there are other more exciting and visible things to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well, guess what happens as soon as we stop pushing on the boulder? You bet. That son of a gun starts rolling backward &lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt; slowly at first, then faster and faster and faster, then bounding and smashing its way down the mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s headed all the way down to the bottom, and the trip down is a whole lot quicker than the trip up. You have to be really brave or really dumb to get in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we ever stop pushing to keep maintenance proactive, we will be back down and dirty in the reactive mode before we know it&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;back down in the dark, cold, slimy, muddy gulch at the bottom, where all kinds of nasty, obnoxious creatures are hissing and snarling and biting at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now down here it takes way more resources, time, money, blood, sweat and tears just to get through (just to survive) the day. We were starting to have it made when we were at the top. Comparatively, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking that much to stay there, but we just didn&amp;rsquo;t realize what we had, and what it took to stay there. We took it for granted and we lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now we have to start over, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be tougher this time because now we have a serious credibility issue. Will we be like Sisyphus again this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Konecranes Launches Remote Crane Maintenance Services</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/25/4a04399b-76de-4686-9cb0-077960385dd1_Konecranes3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;Konecranes recently launched its Truconnect remote services to ensure that cranes used in industrial processes are up and running at all times. The first two products being offered are the Truview data-reporting service and the full-service package Trucare solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on remote connection between the crane and a Konecranes remote center, Truview provides customers with a realistic view of their crane&amp;rsquo;s operating conditions through continuous data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All information from the crane is automatically sent to the remote center to be further processed and finally concretized in sophisticated reports,&amp;rdquo; says Tuomo H&amp;auml;rk&amp;ouml;nen, head of Global Technical Services. &amp;ldquo;In the remote center, we have a dedicated organization and enough resources to operate the remote services worldwide. Truview can be offered also for older cranes through installation of a retrofitting package that enables the remote connection. It&amp;rsquo;s even possible to install the remote connection for a competitor&amp;rsquo;s cranes if we have a maintenance contract with the customer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reports compiled by Truview can be viewed over the Internet by both the customer and Konecranes&amp;rsquo; maintenance staff. Konecranes&amp;rsquo; global service network consists of more than 3,500 service technicians in 46 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the reports, we emphasize safety issues such as whether overloads or emergency stops have occurred, and how the maintenance can be optimized,&amp;rdquo; says Sampsa Mattheiszen, Konecranes product engineer. &amp;ldquo;As all data come from actual usage, it is possible to tailor the maintenance for individual cranes according to the real need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Truview enables Konecranes to help its customers not just to improve the safe use of their equipment but also to provide the right maintenance at the right time and to assess the life cycle of crane components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It makes it possible, for example, to postpone certain overhauls of a crane if the data show that it&amp;rsquo;s been used less than the estimated lifetime,&amp;rdquo; explains Mattheiszen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trucare is a five-year full-service package that the company offers with new industrial CXT cranes that are still within their warranty period. Trucare always includes Truview, and for a fixed monthly fee it covers all necessary maintenance activities and spare parts for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Improve Equipment Effectiveness by Targeting 11 Major Losses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Everyone wants a silver bullet to address the competitive environment pressuring profits and, ultimately, jobs in North America. Having transitioned from a controls engineer to a maintenance manager to an operations manager, I can attest to the quest for that silver bullet. The reality is that few levers exist for you to pull that will radically improve the profitability of your organization. With global markets and price supports, commodity costs are generally fixed. The same applies to prices received for your company&amp;rsquo;s products or services. Labor markets and costs are somewhat fixed as well. With the exception of fuel surcharges, logistics costs are generally set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance or operations manager, your span of control is bound by the four walls of your site. With energy prices, some opportunities exist for cost reduction in pursuing energy audits and savings activities. The largest opportunity is focusing your efforts on improving equipment effectiveness by targeting the 11 major losses. In targeting these losses, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to return more than 400 percent and improve employee engagement in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 11 losses are divided into four major categories: planned shutdown, downtime, performance efficiency and quality losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned shutdown losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category is not often considered a loss, and it can be a hidden opportunity to produce product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 1 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost capacity due to production not being scheduled, equipment shut off for breaks, and shift changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The plant may only run Monday through Friday, leaving Saturday and Sunday available. In a three-shift operation, the third shift may be dedicated for maintenance. At one site, the operators in an area would shut down baggers as they went to break. Enforcing a break schedule to ensure every machine was covered during breaks solved the loss. In another area, the ability existed to automatically trend the bagger performance. Thirty minutes before every shift change, the bagger would be shut off to change the code dates. The baggers would not restart until the next shift came onto the floor and got the handoff from the previous shift. Bringing a heightened awareness by posting the trends solved this loss.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Capacity lost to planned maintenance. &lt;/strong&gt;Does it take an entire shift every day to do planned maintenance? Proper planning and scheduling procedures with audit and continuous improvement loops are utilized to address this loss. The maintenance supervisor should target 65 percent of his or her time on the floor ensuring the jobs are moving along and removing any obstacles. Take NASCAR as an example. In 1950, a pit stop took nearly four minutes. Today, the pit crew takes less than 20 seconds to put the car back on the track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Downtime losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes the following areas of loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 3 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The obvious equipment failures or breakdowns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re not tracking downtime or don&amp;rsquo;t believe the numbers, focus on the major events. To start, document the critical events that lose two hours or more. Create a simple root cause analysis form to track them. Empower a cross-functional team of maintenance and operations to determine the root cause and not blame. Action the findings to ensure the event never occurs again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 4 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The setup and changeover to change from one product or lot to another. &lt;/strong&gt;Empower your employees to develop new methods that reduce these times. In one area, reducing the time required for Clean In Place (CIP) cycles yielded the same cleaning levels but reduced the overall changeover time by more than one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 5 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time required to make the tool changes and part changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Tools like single-minute exchange of dies (SMED) break down these changeovers into single steps. In the changeover on a flow wrapping system, there were 247 steps identified, which required 2.5 hours to complete. After initiating SMED, the changeover was reduced to 15 steps and the time to 30 minutes. The approaches used in NASCAR are very similar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 6 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The startup and shutdown of equipment and processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop startup and shutdown sequences everyone must follow based on best practices from equipment operators. Create a chart that sequences every task on the startup or shutdown. Look for opportunities for parallel tasks. Empower a maintenance and operations team to reduce the amount of time required for each sequence. Determine the feasibility of automating all or portions of the events in the control system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Performance-efficiency losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes losses where equipment speed, output or capacity is not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 7 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment minor stops such as paper tearing out of wrapper or film not tracking correctly can add up over time.&lt;/strong&gt; These machine hiccups are not generally tracked but when totaled are amazing. Minor stops of six minutes each shift occurring over a three-shift, five-day operation add up to 75 hours lost in a 50-week year. Fix this to return almost 10 shifts of capacity for one machine alone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 8 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower output (productivity) from equipment that is operated at less than design speed or cycle times. &lt;/strong&gt;With age and wear, machines tend to run slower. A 10 percent loss is a common occurrence. Operators run the equipment slower, compensating in the belief of reducing the failures or minor stops. Lack of communications can play a role with this type of loss. Maintenance slowed a case packer until a repair was made. After the repair was complete, operators were running the equipment at the lower rate weeks later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Quality losses: &lt;/strong&gt;These losses make up the final category. Quality products can&amp;rsquo;t be made from poorly maintained equipment nor can quality be maintained from equipment that is consistently out of specification. If the equipment is running at design rate and is available on demand, yet it is not producing quality product, it&amp;rsquo;s just making waste at rate. Not only do you lose capacity and labor, you lose the material costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 9 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;The losses generated in waste or scrap is straightforward. It&amp;rsquo;s not just waste, it is lost capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 10 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Product that is defective or not saleable is a major loss. Even if it can be reworked or recycled, it costs valuable labor and capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 11 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Startups and shutdowns create yield or transition losses. During the startup or shutdown, quality product is not produced and is wasted. Solutions identified in Loss 6 above can be utilized to reduce the ramp-up or ramp-down losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with this knowledge, challenge yourself by walking around your site and determine where the opportunities for improvement are available. You might be surprised when flipping over the unturned stones. Stop these losses by developing a program of maintenance for your equipment to assure capacity. Require support from all groups involved with the daily use of the equipment and solicit input from employees at all levels within your company. Using these engaged employees, create a passion for performance and provide quantifiable results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Keep Maintenance Simple: Use Senses and Sensibility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What good is it to have advanced maintenance techniques if they have no real benefit over simple basic maintenance? Now I am not saying go and throw away all of your fancy toys. What I am saying is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have advanced tools for every maintenance task. I have seen many maintenance groups that have adopted certain maintenance techniques and, in turn, overuse them on everything they can be used on. The point is, why use them if they are not cost effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many cases in which a failure can be detected with an operator&amp;rsquo;s or technician&amp;rsquo;s built-in test equipment that takes no special training to use. This equipment is his or her senses &amp;mdash; sight, sound, feel and taste (not recommended). These are all skills that should be taken into account when performing any kind of maintenance analysis. In many cases, a technician or operator can detect a potential failure in adequate time to mitigate the consequences of a functional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many different improvement programs use criticality to determine what maintenance they need to use to effectively manage their asset. If a functional failure has no impact on safety, environment or operation and minimal economic impact, and an operator or technician will normally detect the failure in plenty of time, why would you use any tool that costs more than just the standard senses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the different maintenance improvement programs being used today employ logic that helps guide the decisions on what maintenance to perform. This logic normally includes probability of failure and severity of the failure. This approach can help avoid performing unnecessary and costly maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/fsYUycgY8mQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Proper Training Can Increase Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I recently had the opportunity to make a first visit to a new client&amp;rsquo;s site. As you would expect, upon arrival I was required to attend the contractor/vendor safety orientation training before I could be set loose in the site facilities. This client site was in the Deep South, and our instructor for the training was the site safety coordinator, a local gentleman who had been employed in or around the area all his life. With his Southern drawl, he said everything about three times. (I could never quite figure out if he wanted to make sure we &amp;ldquo;got it,&amp;rdquo; or if he just liked saying everything at least three times.) I recall that the training was very good and to the point, and everyone in the training session was fully aware of all the safety rules and all the potential hazards of the site.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Why was this safety orientation training required by the client site? First, there is an OSHA requirement that everyone be trained in the real and potential hazards of the site before they can be allowed into the site. Second, and more importantly, statistics show that the overall number of workplace injuries and deaths has decreased significantly since we started putting more focus on workplace safety and injury prevention. Basically, the training we receive makes us more aware and more careful in the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Businesses today are consumed with demands from shareholders and owners to decrease costs while making more products at a higher profit. You can decrease costs in many ways, but most people realize that you cannot cut your way to prosperity. Whatever you might cut out of your budget today in many cases will have to be replaced in kind at some point in the future. I have seen too many examples of cost-cutting where the first thing to go is people. The second is training, and the third is investment in proper maintenance of assets.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We want our businesses to be profitable, and to do that our assets must be reliable. Every operating asset must operate as designed for the period we schedule it to run without failure. We can spend money to replace, upgrade, repair or otherwise make our assets reliable, but without the expertise to keep them in that reliable condition, we are in a never-ending cycle of &amp;ldquo;run, fix, run, fix&amp;rdquo; until there is no life remaining in the assets or the people. If our operators and maintenance people are not doing the right things at the right time, our reliability surely will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One thing you can do to get out of this cycle is to make sure your maintenance and operations employees have the knowledge and can get the experience needed to sustain your assets at a high level of reliability. You can decide to train your people in-house, using experienced craftsmen and operators as trainers. This can work very well, assuming that you have made the right choices in the teachers/mentors/coaches you assign to your new employees. If the people you select as teachers have learned any bad habits during their tenure, they may pass along those bad habits to the new people. If the teacher has not been able to keep up to date on advances in technology and tools, there will be something lacking in the training they pass along. After carefully analyzing the current level of expertise in your organization, you may determine that you need outside help in training your people.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Outside training help can come from any number of resources available in the immediate area of your business. There are technical schools and colleges, factory schools, traveling training and seminars, local vendors or dedicated professional training providers such as the Life Cycle Institute. In an active training environment, using tools such as learning impact maps, your employees can learn the latest in technology and approaches to proper operation and maintenance of plant assets, what to look for, what tools may be used to detect potential problems and, most importantly, why you should be proactive in your approach to reliability of your assets. If your employees know what to do, how to do it and why it is important to do it right the first time, you can more easily achieve the goals of reducing costs to operate and improve your throughput and profit.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Reliability of our assets depends upon the correct operation and maintenance of those assets, as well as our ability to repeat these practices on a daily basis to sustain a high level of reliability. Giving your employees knowledge, experience and an understanding of the value that training brings to the business puts you in a position to gain more market share. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which of your competitors are doing this most effectively. They are the ones at the top of the market share, and they will remain there as long as they can keep their people and their assets operating at a high level of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When your business is not operating as profitably as you need it to, ask &amp;ldquo;What can we do to get better?&amp;rdquo; Constantly analyze your business to determine where you can improve and get an edge on the competition. One of your first questions to ask should be, &amp;ldquo;Are our people doing the right things for the right reasons?&amp;rdquo; Training your people to become better, smarter operators and maintenance people should not be discounted in your analysis. In fact, it should be right at the top of your list. Long-term reliability and improved market share depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Set Frequencies for PM Inspections</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For those of you who want to indulge in the details of setting preventive maintenance (PM) inspections, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with defining what I mean by inspections. Inspections include all objective inspections (we measure something) using an instrument &amp;ndash; for example, a vibration analyzer, an infrared camera, a volt meter, a flow meter or ultrasonic equipment. Inspections also include all subjective inspections (look-listen-feel-smell). In order to set inspection frequencies, we need to understand what a failure-developing period is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The failure-developing period (FDP), also called the Pf Curve by some, is the time period from when it is possible to detect a failure until we have a breakdown. A failure is when a system or piece of equipment is operating correctly within given parameters, but it shows signs of problems. For example, a centrifugal pump may be cavitating, but it is still providing the required flow for the operation. We have a failure but not a breakdown. The cavitation in our example will eventually develop into a breakdown. The breakdown occurs when the pump is unable to perform its intended function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The FDP is the time difference between the failure and the breakdown. If the pump started to cavitate at 6 a.m. and it broke down at 6 p.m. four days later, the FDP is 108 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Inspection Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inspection frequency should roughly be FDP divided by two. For example, if the failure-developing period is 14 days and we need some time to plan and schedule the corrective maintenance for that failure, I think a reasonable inspection frequency is seven days (FDP/2). If the inspection frequency is longer than 14 days, we may miss the failure and will have a breakdown on our hands. So our rule of thumb is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;Inspection frequency = FDP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, the real problem is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know what the FDP is. There is no standard, no documentation. Most plants usually have no history on FDP. So what do you do? Let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper with some additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Inspection Tools Change the FDP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also need to understand that the FDP changes when we have access to better tools. For example, we may be able to detect a problem with a pillow block bearing by listening to it by putting a screwdriver to our ear (and the bearing). This method may give us a warning period of a few days (on average, depending on situation). However, if we buy a vibration analyzer, we can probably detect the same failure at least six weeks in advance. The failure is the same, but the FDP has changed. For the most part, the only reason we buy inspection tools is to extend the FDP with accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In reality, the ability to detect a failure and the FDP also depends on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the person&amp;rsquo;s ability to do the inspection;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the environment (lighting, temperature, indoor vs. outdoor, etc);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		operational parameters at the time of inspection;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		equipment design and accessibility;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Many Variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each component has many failure modes, and each failure mode has different FDPs. We also know that each FDP may change depending on the inspection tool, technique, the person doing the inspection and more. On top of all this, each component is running at different speeds, different loads and&amp;nbsp;in a different environment. Everything is different. Now we are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point of reasoning, many plants go the wrong way, in my opinion. Some plants make the conclusion that a massive study needs to be done in order to find the answers to all of these questions. Why is this not a good approach? It is not because in 999 times out of 1,000 you will not have the data you need to do the analysis. Even if you did, the best bang for the buck is usually to get your people trained and then out there doing inspections rather than performing a big analysis. What you will end up with when you do a complicated analysis without data is a wild, somewhat educated guess with a lot of work. So let&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;not do the complicated analysis and instead do a wild, somewhat educated guess using our experience and cut out 99.9 percent of the work? Does that sound good to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Wild, Somewhat Educated Guess&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some typical problems with an AC motor. This is far from all failure modes. For example, if you look at the SKF manual, a bearing has more than 50 failure modes. Therefore, we need to look at the common problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example: AC motor, 125 horsepower, 80 percent load, 24/7 operation, dusty environment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/3/e7d81d0f-7bfa-45ed-bdbd-add1614a91b7_a-pm-frequency-table1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 500px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned above, there are many more failure modes. I have picked some common problems to illustrate my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we look at the right column, there are many different inspection frequencies, even when we do a simplified analysis. Our estimates are just guesswork and will vary as a result of who is doing the inspection, the type of tool and the environment, so we should not take the numbers too seriously; they are estimates. I would, therefore, look at some of the shorter inspection intervals and then add some of the longer-interval inspections to those since we may as well do the longer ones when we are there. They don&amp;rsquo;t take too long to do, and we are just guessing on the intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I look at this AC motor, I would group them as follows in a typical process plant environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/10/3/7fd9bdfc-dd7b-40f7-abbc-36c98eda65e2_pm-frequency-table2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 214px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Other Inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If it is a critical motor, perhaps you want to do a full motor analysis or a simple leakage to ground. I have yet to have a vendor be able to explain what the estimated FDP is using their tools for the above inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Common Logical Error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inspection frequencies are based on FDP, not life of component, nor the criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The life of a component has nothing to do with inspection frequency. For example, a world-class plant may have an average motor life of 18 years. Some motors last eight years and some 25. However, the FDP for these motors are most likely in the one- to four-week span, so life statistics have nothing to do with inspection frequency. A common erroneous argument is &amp;ldquo;we have inspected this component for three years and have not found any problems. Therefore, we extend the inspection frequency from one week to two weeks.&amp;rdquo; The fact that you have not found a problem has nothing to do with the FDP. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed just because the component is running well. Once that component fails, it may be after 15 years, the FDP may still be two weeks and you need to catch it. If you change the inspection period to two weeks, there is roughly a 50 percent risk that you will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Criticality does not affect the FDP but is practically a factor when we assign inspection frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our AC motor bearings are equally critical to our foundation for the operation of the motor. If either fails, the motor stops. However, the FDP and the inspection frequency are different because we base the inspection frequency on the FDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The criticality of the motor may change the selection of the inspection frequency because we are uncertain of the FDP. The FDP is a guess. So a very critical component may be checked more frequently because we don&amp;rsquo;t really know the FDP. It is an insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspection frequencies are based on FDP, not criticality or component life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The FDP is pretty much impossible to predict. However, we can make a pretty good guess to what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you don&amp;rsquo;t have very good historical data as to what the FDP is, don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time making a big study. Make a reasonable guess. It is what you will end up with anyway with a study without data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you have the FDP data, ask if it isn&amp;rsquo;t better to spend the effort in training people in doing inspections and planning and scheduling of corrective actions instead of making a large FDP study. Most of the time, it is better to spend the time on execution.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Quick Guide to PM Development and Execution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In many organizations, groups are often trying to chase the latest buzzwords of the day and yet have never established the foundation required to support those efforts. PM development and execution are classic examples. For this discussion, when I refer to PMs, I am talking about both preventive maintenance and condition-based maintenance tasks. This is by no means an exhaustive explanation of all of the considerations necessary for a comprehensive PM program. It is intended as a rough guide to foster continued discussion into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stop doing non-value added PMs or task steps within the PM. We can never seem to find time to update or correct the PM tasks or frequencies but can always find time to continue doing the wrong work (go figure! ).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assuming that you already have a PM program in place, start with the equipment where you are bleeding or hemorrhaging the most. This is often not your most critical assets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the failure modes of the equipment. The blowout preventer in the Gulf oil spill had more than 260. Per the SKF manual, a bearing has more than 50 failure modes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the Reliability-Centered Maintenance Logic Tree to determine the tasks. Use condition-based monitoring (CBM) techniques where possible first because it&amp;rsquo;s less expensive, especially compared to an overhaul. Yes, some groups still do overhaul maintenance for no other reason than they have done it that way for the last 20 years. Your equipment actually defines the type of PM, as not everything lends itself to predictive technologies, as an example. Run to failure is an option, provided you can limit the collateral damage. CBM often extends or widens the failure detection window over time-based activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define tasks that allow you to find the equipment in the act of failure with respect to each of the failure modes. Failure modes and effects analysis is a great tool for these items, but many groups can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the time to perform them in developing their procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create the procedures using standard text.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Focus on precision maintenance to a specification (i.e. torque values, belt tension).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure to look for hidden failures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set the frequency of the task based on experience and history, if you have it. Generally, in very broad terms, it should be one half the width of the failure detection window. Keep in mind that you need time to effectively plan and schedule the equipment restoration in a proactive manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspect and audit the work processes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure the outcome and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solicit feedback from the crafts performing the PM tasks by adding a continuous improvement loop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Great procedures are a start, but recognize that you may need to focus on changing the behaviors of the people who are doing the work. The behaviors may be as much as 80 percent of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish partnerships with the other stakeholders such as production and engineering. As an example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do the PM when production doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you access to the equipment. No matter how well you maintain it, if the equipment is not operated correctly, no level of maintenance can keep it running. If engineering bought the least cost equipment and installed it with poor methods, you most likely can&amp;rsquo;t overcome that either. Realize the total life cycle costs (LCC) may be upward of 20 times the initial installed cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When you have a failure, you should perform an autopsy to determine why the equipment failed. Review the task procedures and frequencies to determine why you never caught the failure mode in the act of failure. Update the PM based on the findings.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>How Kitting Can Enhance Reliability </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the world of manufacturing, we are looking for better, more efficient ways to improve our production uptime and quality, reduce the cost per unit, improve human capital utilization and create a higher quality of work life for our personnel. Kitting for maintenance crafts to perform their tasks is one of the easier and more effective ways to allow quality completion of the job with minimal productivity impact, especially when accompanied by a well-planned and functionally scheduled job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding the value of kitting in relation to the value of the time lost requires asking and honestly answering some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the job have to be done now or can it wait to be planned and scheduled at a time that minimizes production loss? Will we be able to schedule it at a time that will reduce the amount of product lost through the equipment downtime for the repair?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What materials should be kitted for the job(s)?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is there a value added to the front end work of kitting, controlling and delivering the kit for the job(s)? When will the materials folks know when to send the parts and to where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the job be planned well enough to identify and procure the materials necessary for a timely and quality repair?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will there be enough time to allow for the correct materials to be kitted and delivered, allowing the crafts persons to do the quality repair they want and need to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you can see, there are plenty of potential reasons/excuses for not kitting. All are invalid when kitting is accomplished with a bit of communication, cooperation and coordination. A well-managed materials inventory of the appropriate parts is an absolute necessity. That well-managed inventory will contribute to effective job planning and verification that those materials are the appropriate ones. The better the lead time of job scheduling, the better the planning of the job can be, along with the accurate materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What should be kitted? Do all planned work orders require a kit of the materials required? Should preventive maintenance work orders be kitted? Should lubrication route work orders be kitted? Is there a specific regimen for kitting work orders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Planned work orders for outage, shutdown and turnaround work should, if at all possible, be kitted. This will allow the crafts persons to accomplish their tasking with the quality they desire, in the time frame budgeted by the appropriate management, allowing an on-time completion of the downtime scheduled. Planned work orders for backlog relief should be kitted, again to minimize the production downtime and allow the crafts persons the time to accomplish a quality, within-specification repair to support overall reliability. Preventive maintenance work orders that require repetitive replacement of items such as filters, lubricants, seals, and other expendable items identified for time-based replacement should also be kitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders that require technical troubleshooting that may encompass downtime should be kitted to the degree known. The troubleshooting requirement work orders must be accompanied in the job package by a comprehensive bill of materials that applies to that specific asset or entity, providing the crafts persons with up-to-date information about parts and materials availability in the storeroom. Not all work orders will clearly state the specific needs, therefore the need for troubleshooting by competent crafts persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders that are less complicated or that require items from expendable inventories in the maintenance shop or operating area may not require kitting, though if the work is recurring or programmed maintenance, it may be an easy task to schedule and kit the needed items on a routine basis. It is often easy for the experienced crafts person to be aware of the requirements of the job they are assigned to from the weekly schedule and gather materials from the applicable storage location on the way to the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accurate bills of materials for specific assets or entities allow the planner and crafts persons to proactively obtain the necessary materials for the job. A well-managed storeroom will have the asset or entity location of inventory items identified in that store&amp;rsquo;s stock number for each inventory item, along with the existing requirements anticipated through planned work. Should the unforeseen happen and there is a breakdown, the information for the necessary communication to the appropriate planner can be conveyed immediately. Parts reserved for planned work can be made available to the higher priority work, allowing a controlled replenishment of inventory and functional rescheduling of the lesser priority work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kit delivery is also important. Where and when should the kits for routine work orders be delivered? Where and when should the kits for outage, shutdown and turnaround work be delivered? When should those material items be charged to and issued against that specific asset or entity work order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is most effective to have kits for routine work, scheduled backlog relief work and scheduled preventive maintenance and programmed maintenance delivered the day before the date the work order is scheduled to the applicable drop zone or shop or equipment location. This gives the crafts person time to review the job with the supervisor (if applicable) and to verify that all the needed materials are present and correct. This final verification of materials is a very necessary task. It can be a very expensive disruption to take a system out of production without having the correct materials to accomplish the quality repair in the scheduled time frame. The result is a waste of operators&amp;rsquo; and crafts people&amp;rsquo;s time, production loss, sales and inventory loss and escalated tempers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maintenance planner should ascertain the correct materials for the specific job. Communication with other knowledgeable people, such as qualified operators and experienced crafts people, will ensure the proper materials are identified for the job. The planner should verify the specific items required for the work order and review the kit for the job before the kit is issued. Then, when the kit is issued and delivered, the crafts person scheduled for the job should conduct the final verification. Should a discrepancy be found, there is time to avoid removing the system from service. The work can be rescheduled when all the necessary materials are present, alleviating unnecessary downtime and production loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kits may take the form of &amp;ldquo;crash carts&amp;rdquo; that are functional for planned and scheduled work of all sorts. The crash cart (or &amp;ldquo;rebuild cart&amp;rdquo;) is a container of all the materials that may be necessary to repair, rebuild or overhaul a specific asset. The crafts person takes what is necessary, then, after the job is complete and turned over to operations for production, inventories and commits the items used against the work order for the asset or entity repair, and returns the crash cart to the storeroom for replenishment for the next time it is needed. A kit may just be one bolt or a circuit card. However, it could also be a complete rotating assembly that is a repairable stores item to be issued as a replacement for the like rotating assembly in the field and the used, worn-out rotating assembly returned for rebuild in a planned and scheduled fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kitting for planned and scheduled work makes everyone&amp;rsquo;s life better. It enhances the reliability of the equipment through the quality repair effort, increases uptime and productivity of the equipment, creates less stress for the operator and allows smoother operation of the equipment. There is a good bit of effort required on the front end of setting up a kitting program, but once the program is set and monitored properly, life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Reliability Excellence is Imperative for Safety</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	We tend to speak about financial issues more than moral issues in the business world. Safety is an issue that has significant ramifications from both moral and financial perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safety is a financial imperative in today&amp;rsquo;s business world. According to a 2010 Liberty Mutual study, the annual documented direct and indirect industry cost of U.S. workplace accidents totaled $240 billion per year. The average cost to industry for a fatal accident ranges from a low estimate by the National Safety Council of $1.27 million to the enormous average of $8.6 million per fatality paid out by BP after its refinery explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to an Air Force study, the average cost of a permanent disability is $1.3 million, while a partial disability costs $210,000. Workers&amp;rsquo; compensation premiums, which correlate directly to your accident and incident rate, amount to millions of dollars per year in even a modest-sized company. Any way you look at it, accidents are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dollars and cents aside, no manager or supervisor wants to ever have to face a distraught family and tell them that their spouse or parent will not be coming home tonight. It is hard to look an employee in the eye at the hospital when you know that his or her injuries could have been avoided. Even minor injuries can take a serious toll physically, mentally and economically on everyone involved. I think we can all agree that accidents are an employee event that industry does not want to pay for and nobody ever wants to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The premise of this article is that facilities that rank high in terms of reliability excellence also have superior safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There have been some statistics published that show the relationship between recognized measures of reliability and an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety performance. The source data has not been all that well-documented, but the relationship has been observed many times. Improving safety should be seen as the journey toward reliability excellence proceeds. Rather than focusing on boring cost data and correlations, let&amp;rsquo;s explore why a state of reliability excellence supports excellence in safety performance. For it is from the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; that you can learn how to improve safety performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the 2010 survey, the top five types of accidents in terms of compensation were falls, electrocutions, injuries from working in confined spaces, fires and explosions, and burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The causes of these accidents have their roots in unsafe conditions and unsafe behaviors. Both of these factors are positively influenced by the journey to reliability excellence. What sort of unsafe conditions and behaviors exist in reactive facilities that &lt;u&gt;do not exist&lt;/u&gt; where reliability excellence is in place? Here are a few common ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leaks and spills that contribute to falls and some fires exist in plants where maintenance people are not deployed efficiently and &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; defects like these have to be tolerated. Operators do not keep the equipment clean and in good order. Thus, the sources of leaks are not identified and corrected easily at an early stage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Falls often result from temporary hoses and pipes, poorly barricaded &amp;ldquo;emergency work&amp;rdquo; areas, and the seemingly inevitable debris that there is &amp;ldquo;never time to clean up&amp;rdquo; before proceeding to the next emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Electrocutions often occur because of poorly maintained electrical grounding systems and power tools. In a reactive facility, there never seems to be enough time to ensure that grounding checks are made, and that GFCIs are always used. Other electrocutions occur during emergency troubleshooting and repair of equipment. Often there is &amp;ldquo;not enough time&amp;rdquo; or the organizational discipline is lacking to perform LOTO consistently. Poorly planned high work near power lines is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Confined space injuries occur largely because of the lack of individual or supervisory discipline within the organization necessary to adhere to confined space procedures. Poor job planning and insufficient preparation for confined space entry also play a role. The absence of consistent employee training is often cited. Constant job interruptions and the rush associated with urgent work compound the situation by contributing to poor decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Although falls account for the largest number of fatalities, fires and explosions always get attention. When you dig into the root causes of fires and explosions, you come across these contributors: poor configuration management (control of alterations to materials, process and procedures), leaks and spills, and lack of a disciplined adherence to procedures. In a reactive plant, procedures get bypassed and alterations and material substitutions are made to compensate for emergencies and poor material management systems. Leaks, spills and general poor housekeeping literally &amp;ldquo;add fuel to the fire&amp;rdquo; when one occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Burns not occurring as a result of fire are often attributed to hot liquid leaks. Leaks abound in reactive plants. In process plants, a very common cause is poor thermal protection condition, such as pipes and vessels with missing or damaged insulation. In a reactive facility, costs are high and manpower is generally scarce. Often one of the first things to be sacrificed is &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; leak repairs and the condition of insulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These fundamental root causes are present in the top five accident types. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how a reliability excellenceenvironment mitigates or eliminates these root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Procedures and Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No procedures or poor discipline to follow existing ones are characteristic of a reactive environment. Within reliability excellence, work processes and procedures are fundamental. Creation of process and procedure is one of the first steps taken in the implementation of reliability excellence. Discipline results from setting expectations, measuring results and holding people accountable. It is also the reliability excellenceresult of establishing a culture that encourages and rewards a disciplined approach. Disciplined does not mean stagnant. Structured continuous improvement is an integral part of reliability excellence, but the days of the &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cowboys&amp;rdquo; are over. Reliability excellenceemploys the principles of change management to develop the right culture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Poor or no job planning and a high level of emergencies set the stage for accidents. Lack of planning forces people to hurry and &amp;ldquo;make it up as they go,&amp;rdquo; creating opportunities for errors. In the reliability excellenceenvironment, more than 90 percent of jobs are planned and scheduled. Emergencies are few because effective preventive maintenance programs are in place. Chronic failures are systematically identified and corrected, and the root causes eliminated by loss and failure elimination processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient Maintenance Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reactive sites consume budget money and craft resources in huge quantities. The poor or omitted maintenance that creates an unsafe work environment often exists due to lack of money and people. When good work execution practices are in place as a result of reliability excellence, the productivity of the maintenance organization increases by as much as 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers using effective loss and failure elimination processes significantly reduce the number of chronic failures. These and the preventive and predictive maintenance programs developed and deployed in a reliability excellenceimplementation extend the equipment mean time between failures and eliminate much unnecessary emergency work. The overall cost of maintenance goes down, while the level of maintenance goes up as resources, once poorly utilized reactively, are now available for proactively addressing all of the maintenance needs of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Housekeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Temporary&amp;rdquo; hoses and pipes as well as debris left behind from emergency repairs or only partially completed maintenance create an unsafe work environment. In a proactive environment, emergency repairs become the exception. Craft people are not pulled away from partially completed jobs to deal with the next emergency. In addition, every job includes the time to render the work area safe and clean before moving to the next job. General housekeeping improves as well. Indeed, 5S is integral to reliability excellence. Clear expectations and scheduled tasks generated by the operator care function result in operators who have the time, the ability and the desire to maintain a clean and safe workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Configuration Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uncontrolled changes often create unsafe process and equipment conditions. There is a history of major industrial accidents resulting from poor control of changes. Condition monitoring is one of the fundamental components of a reliability excellenceimplementation, thus ensuring an appropriate level of procedural safeguards is in place. Often the need to make changes is the result of a reactive environment. Parts and material substitutions occur when the material management function is not working, and a breakdown occurs. World-class material management practices ensure that the right parts in the right amount are at the right place at the right time. The failure elimination process eradicates most chronic and unpredictable failures. Between the two, much of the need for emergency work-arounds, which are often the drivers for configuration management failures, simply goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Either from neglect by reactive leadership or from lack of necessary resources, training is often poor quality or non-existent. With reliability excellencecomes reduced failure rates, less severe failures, more productive use of craft labor and the ability to schedule effectively. Process interruptions become rare. Both the time and money to train your people become available. The world-class target of 2 percent of labor hours devoted to training becomes not just possible but desirable. Root-cause analysis of failures helps to target specific training needs. Tracking systems that are integral to the process validate the effectiveness of your training dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Poor Decision-Making/Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lack of process, asset and organizational stability in a reactive environment forces people to make decisions under time pressure, often reacting to totally new situations. Process upsets and equipment breakdowns generate overtime, which is frequently excessive and unplanned. This leads to fatigue, which leads to poor decision-making and errors and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human-error rate tables indicate that the average trained and competent person performing a routine repetitive task under no unusual stress will make a mistake roughly once every 500 times he or she performs it. Add fatigue, being in a hurry and having to perform non-routine tasks, and the error rate increases to roughly once in every 25 actions. In the right (or rather wrong) emergency conditions, the error rate can be as much as one in four. It is little wonder that the accident rate is so high at facilities that have unstable processes and unstable equipment. Reliability excellence introduces stability, predictable work schedules and lower stress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Management Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In sites where it is a daily battle to make production and keep poorly maintained assets running, it is hard to find the time to focus on improving safety. When assets and processes are stable and under control, when you have the resources to maintain the facility at peak condition, and budget pressures are lower, then you have the time, energy and ability to focus on safety. Reliability excellence creates this very environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, whether for moral or financial reasons, reliability excellence is an imperative for a safe and profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The 10-second Measure of Maintenance Effectiveness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Two decades ago, I worked in the Florida citrus industry. Near the end of each growing season, the fruit became softer. This promoted increased damage during handling, especially in the bins where the fruit was temporarily stored during testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This, of course, wasted money, as juice literally went down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We built and automated a system that would allow us to bypass these storage bins while still allowing us to meet all of the necessary testing requirements. But this system came with its own costs and risks, so it was only economical to operate late in the season when fruit quality was diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our company had sophisticated measurements in place, including comparative values across the state. We could use these measures to determine at what point in each season we should convert to this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But, we didn&amp;rsquo;t need those comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My engineering office was on one side of those elevated fruit bins. The business offices were on the other. Every morning, I walked under them to a staff meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When my shoes began to stick to the floor, from the bit of extra juice that had been lost from the fruit, I knew in 10 seconds that it was time to switch systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few years later, I had a new role in another company, installing maintenance software systems in 33 factories. We found a broad spectrum of maintenance capabilities and results. We also found this interesting corollary: The factories with the cleanest repair shop floors were also the factories with the greatest maintenance effectiveness! No oily rags or metal shavings on the floor. Floor coatings in good condition. Regularly swept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that a clean shop resulted in high maintenance effectiveness. It was that the professionalism and discipline that supported effective maintenance programs also supported a clean shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take 10 seconds to look down at the floor the next time you walk through your repair shop. What does it say about your maintenance operation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(Try this in your favorite automotive repair shop next time you take your car in for repair.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/A9c6muxu6rs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Let Risk and Your Equipment Determine Your Maintenance Strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I attend conferences and workshops and read articles on maintenance and reliability, more and more I hear people touting that preventive maintenance is more costly and not the right approach. When we talk about preventive maintenance, we are primarily talking about time-based inspections, but it can include overhauls/rebuilds as well. But before we take statements like these as the gospel and apply them carte blanche to all of our equipment, we need to understand the basis for that reasoning and when to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the Reliability-Centered Maintenance side, we know that we can&amp;rsquo;t apply the single bathtub curve to all equipment failures. We recognize that six separate failure curves exist, and greater than 80 percent of all failures occur outside the infant mortality or end-of-life wear-out zones, meaning the failures are totally random in nature. No doubt that condition-based monitoring using various tools like vibration or temperature monitoring is better and a less costly solution over time-based preventive maintenance, especially overhauls. This provides the basis for some saying that doing more than roughly 20 percent preventive maintenance is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/11/45fd9688-b405-4933-b630-cfcb46130261_prison.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;RCM teaches us that maintenance is really about minimizing the consequences of failure or our risk. Our equipment and the risk should determine our maintenance strategy for any given piece of equipment, not someone telling us preventive maintenance is bad. To do this, we can use a tool like the RCM Logic Tree. The RCM Logic tree places the emphasis on safety and environmental concerns first, followed by production or capacity losses. If we can apply a condition-monitoring strategy, that is our first choice because of the random failures. However, not all equipment lends itself to a condition-monitoring approach, which leads us to time-based preventive maintenance inspections and overhauls. If we can&amp;rsquo;t detect the equipment in the act of failing using either of these based on risk, we can choose to re-engineer the equipment or run it to failure. If we choose &amp;ldquo;run to failure&amp;rdquo;, we should have a proactive strategy that returns the equipment to its normal state as quickly as possible (Neil Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Canon Law). Additionally, we should ensure that running an item to failure doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost us more money due to collateral damage (i.e. a bearing failure that takes out a shaft and the housing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let me give you a few examples of where time-based (cycles, hours, days, etc.) preventive maintenance is a better solution based on the equipment, the failure modes and the consequences of failure. Take a correctional facility and the lamps in the overhead lighting fixtures as the first example. In most organizations, we would choose to run these to failure, correct? In a correctional facility, the cell block has to be cleared of the inmates before the maintenance worker can access the lamps. Depending on the security level of the cell block, it may be more cost-effective to re-lamp all the fixtures at say, a 10,000-hour interval. Next, let&amp;rsquo;s take a contact lens manufacturer. The machines that form, shape and package the contact lens utilize small components like cylinders and small servo drives in tight locations that don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to many condition-monitoring approaches. Past best practice has been to change out some of these components based on the number of strokes or cycles. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s take a 165-valve bottle filler used in the various beverage industries. Organizations with this equipment typically run many shifts during their peak season. The filler valves typically don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to condition monitoring, and random failures with partial replacements during the shifts are cost-prohibitive due to downtime losses. Most choose to overhaul these fillers on time-based intervals to lessen the risk of failure during the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, in summary, while condition-based monitoring is a more cost-effective solution, the risk and failure modes must determine the maintenance strategy that you apply to your equipment. Use tools like the RCM Logic Tree to help you determine the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/CdPFgM7mNEQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>What Plants Have Failed to Learn in 25 Years</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/4/912d9182-9821-4c64-b120-153c005606f5_sub.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, I left the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I gained experience in civilian industry, I began to appreciate the Navy&amp;rsquo;s aplomb for reliable engineering, exceptional training and consistent operations. Their penchant for comprehensive preventive maintenance programs also impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I found in industry 25 years ago was quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There was almost no redundancy in design; the failure of a single small pump could shut down an entire plant. Sanitary systems had been modified over time, introducing unsanitary attributes. Many components were chosen solely on initial cost, not reliability or life cycle cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator training was limited to &amp;ldquo;hit the green button in the morning, the red button at night, and call maintenance if anything goes wrong.&amp;rdquo; We especially didn&amp;rsquo;t train operators on what to do in abnormal situations, so small problems often snowballed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standard procedures (SOPs, CBMs), if written at all, were relegated to a dusty bookshelf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		And, nearly all maintenance was reactive in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So quite by accident, it seems, I began a career of helping companies do these things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I claim some small successes on my resume, at least in individual factories where I worked. But wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you think with all the improvements our industrial society has made, and with progressive publications like &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, that we would have evolved to a better place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My work recently took me back to some of the factories of a company I worked with long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technologies have improved with mix-proof sanitary valves and PLCs. But, there is still little control of changes and little redundancy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training is better regarding mandatory safety programs, but no better in system operation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SOPs remain on the shelf in most locations. The only nod to improved consistency is in the expanded use of automated controls (PLCs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Most sad to me is that maintenance remains almost entirely reactive. For all of the sophisticated predictive technologies that have been developed, a huge amount of our machinery is run to failure. Expensive systems fail prematurely, requiring big buckets of capital dollars to replace them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we had kept this same rate of improvement in other aspects of our business, we would still be calculating our financials on computers running Windows for Workgroups V3.1.1. We would be tracking inventory and shipments on spreadsheets instead of ERP systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By this point, I have surely angered some maintenance and engineering professionals. They have made great strides in their individual locations. That isn&amp;rsquo;t my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My point is, after 25 years, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ALL of our factories, large and small alike, be much further down the path than they are? Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/8c2c7g4kXKY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/4/108310bc-d44d-4ac2-946c-3130635a60ab_supervisor-enigma.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;In my pre-retired life, I managed the development of maintenance procedures, PM programs, methods and service tools for all deployed equipment within the U.S. Postal Service. We also monitored our maintenance procedures manuals which incorporated support policies for the maintenance management information system. Any local changes were to be approved on a trial basis by my shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At that time, we were scratching our heads on how to get the supervisors out of their desks and out on the floor for more face time with the craft employees. I received a call from a plant maintenance manager requesting to stop recording the employees&amp;rsquo; work order time on the daily work schedule forms. This was accomplished at the end of each shift by the supervisors from completed work orders. Each supervisor spent about an hour on this clerical task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It seems the data entry to the MMIS is taken off the work order itself. The schedule sheet is only used for work assignments. He had devised a simple process to audit to assure accuracy. We gladly accepted his proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About two months later, he called and told me that his supervisors were still tied to their desks. Somehow they had found more administrative work to do. His further investigation indicated that his supervisors did not know what to do with the added floor time. He asked for help with this oxymoron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I will write several follow-on blog postings, prompted by this symptom, of a larger problem that we uncovered over the ensuing months, but I want to focus on the Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law that covers what happened here: The work will expand to fill the time allotted. An overall truism is that when you remove some repetitive work from a person&amp;rsquo;s day, you had better have something to replace it or the employee will find something to fill the void. This is a big issue with any changes in work design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It goes further when we consider that there is a ripple effect in any system when we make a change. We have to really understand how the system actually operates if we really want to manage for results. This is especially important when we are affecting a person&amp;rsquo;s work day. And over the years, seemingly small changes in many legacy systems have nurtured and matured work-around processes/methods, resulting in relying on individuals to perform that which the organization is responsible for: training and development. And I submit that the victim is usually the first-line supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The larger issue which we encountered was the abilities of our supervisors to supervise and even more telling was &amp;ldquo;what did we mean by supervise?&amp;rdquo; What does face time mean? How does a planned work order fit into the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s tool bag? How do we communicate change? What tools does the supervisor have? What are industrial best practices for supervisors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe we should start with the question: Why do we need supervisors? I am not an expert but will give actual examples of how some companies have addressed the question. They may include a plant with no management, face time as an interpersonal skill, learning organizations, &amp;ldquo;empowerment&amp;rdquo;, training and development, and hopefully some examples sent in by my faithful readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember: humility trumps pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/yv4lLrdpamM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Quintessential Asset Management:    The Road to Reliability-centered Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Asset-management programs and software are getting a lot of press these days. Every maintenance engineer and his site manager are writing a white paper and/or book about the value of asset management to a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. There are measuring tools and concepts galore, all intended to provide an instantly successful maintenance process. Much of this content makes achieving reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) sound relatively easy and commonplace. This fosters a misguided concept that RCM and CBM are commodities that can be purchased and implemented in short order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to explain how to gauge where a company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program stands and where its goals need to ultimately lie, we need another catch phrase that is all encompassing of the total maintenance-management-process approach and ultimate goal. How does Quintessential Asset Management (QAM) sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the five levels of asset-management development a company usually passes through leading to more advanced processes such as CBM and RCM to eventually achieve QAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s define Quintessential Asset Management as the culture, processes and tools required to efficiently maintain an enterprise&amp;rsquo;s equipment for optimum production. Like anything else in business, it&amp;rsquo;s all about profitability or bang for your buck. Like anything else, there are trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to have real-time data and dashboards at your fingertips when you want to make a decision, but achieving this level of technological sophistication requires discipline over a period of time despite business trends that tend to ebb and rise. Maintenance is not unlike a safety or quality program that might get put on hold or abandoned during periods of slow business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies may cut back and lose top-notch, irreplaceable experience that comes back to haunt them when business picks up, instead of being patient and thinking in the long term. During these slow periods when a company has the available human resources, those who would be process &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; will dedicate themselves to value-added projects like maintenance improvement not only for the benefit of the company but also for their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The word quintessential comes from ancient physics as the fifth element that holds the other four elements of earth, wind, air and fire together. Think of maintenance as the fifth element that brings and keeps a profitable asset-driven business together. In modern English, quintessential has come to mean the model of a concept. For example, you may have heard people say Joe Montana was the quintessential quarterback. He may not have been flashy, but he got the job done by being efficient, reliable and interacting well with his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In embarking on your QAM journey, the first questions to ask yourself are where is your company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program and where do you want to take it. An enterprise needs to establish a valid benchmark of where it stands, set realistic goals and then evaluate its progress honestly and openly at predetermined intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development and maturity of a maintenance program isn&amp;rsquo;t unlike that of a human being. In its infancy, everything is reactive. The machinery breaks, and the production people are screaming for attention. Since there&amp;rsquo;s not a maintenance history to draw knowledge from, repairs are more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a program advances and the technicians learn the equipment and start figuring out preventative measures, it moves toward adolescence where it needs more structure. Then as technology and information systems around maintenance and asset management develop around automated communication processes and historical data, the challenge becomes the move toward proactively and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it&amp;rsquo;s mature, decisions need to be made based on experience that can push efficiency even further. It is at this level where RCM (reliability-centered maintenance) can be effectively implemented. A few years of historical data and a comprehensive asset-management software system need to be in place before an organization can begin to decide which equipment is truly critical. RCM methodologies can now be used to maintain equipment while developing trends showing where they might save money by doing less maintenance or even running some equipment to failure. Once these processes are in place with a plan to monitor and further improve them, QAM has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 1- Disruptive/Reactive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everything has to start some place, and maintenance is no exception. There is no equipment history to fall back on, and all maintenance is reactive. Some enterprises start manufacturing or servicing products that don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge maintenance until it literally bites them in the balance sheet. Some welder or machinist will do minor repairs on failed equipment, and service representatives will be called in for major issues. As time goes by, the failures start really creating production problems and can actually cause a viable business to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 2- Folders and Spreadsheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level two, companies start hiring maintenance mechanics and might even allow one to sit behind a desk a certain percentage of the time in order to plan maintenance and keep records. It is at this stage that calendar and operational time based PMs are put in place and technicians start keeping an equipment history. Many companies only move to this level to appease some quality standard for their industry such as QS or ISO. Many companies stay at this level indefinitely, perhaps due to a prevailing notion that if a technician isn&amp;rsquo;t turning tools on a broken machine, he&amp;rsquo;s wasting time. More proactive planning and management are not seen as value added items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/5b89ecbe-2f7d-4881-a7e3-f5ffd61072df_QAM1.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 357px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;In this screen shot, notice that the graphical representation of the equipment structure is hierarchical and navigable. &amp;nbsp;The equipment records and work-order screens are scalable. Shown is a more mature representation of an equipment object with documents attached. This can be simplified dramatically to only show the fields and tabs in use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 3- Basic CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At last, a computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) has been approved and a team has been assigned to investigate the costs and approaches required to follow through on that commitment. &amp;nbsp;There is support from management for the project, and a few champions have stepped up to take the lead on software selection and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies make the mistake of paying good money for a CMMS but cut corners on implementation. This is an example of what&amp;rsquo;s called stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. They consider the time required to collect and input pertinent data as time the technicians could be applying to the equipment instead of realizing you have to put good data in to get good data out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, other well-meaning implementation teams try to do too much right out of the gate. They want to use every available field on a fault report or work order before they even understand many of the key performance indicators (KPIs) they ultimately want to monitor. Letting a system evolve to some extent always makes the best sense. Time is money, and it requires time to enter data in the system. Having a technician fill out a field that&amp;rsquo;s not necessary is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the maintenance system develops, using a particular field may make more sense but is not available because it&amp;rsquo;s already being used and full of impertinent information. Poor implementation also results in a situation where the equipment isn&amp;rsquo;t set up correctly or the information entered into the system is based on guesswork. It makes sense in many instances to be patient and wait for work history to identify needs. A well-designed maintenance program will optimized with age. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need a plan of where you want to go with the system before you set up the implementation. Lay out phases and goals with timelines. Benchmark where you&amp;rsquo;re at and schedule intervals of honest evaluation. Hire the right consultants to help you. They may or may not be the software vendor. Be sure to have your best maintenance people on the core team who are getting input from the technicians and in-house subject matter experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for in a CMMS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obviously, the first thing you want to make sure of is whether the company providing the software is going to be around for a while and has a structured product-improvement model. You want it to be scalable so your program can grow into the tools the CMMS has to offer, including KPI dashboards, trending and possible real-time data-capture feeds from machine-operation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Is the input simple and does the navigation feel intuitive? Other important facets are equipment structures that allow quick visibility of cost roll-up. You will also want preventative-maintenance tools that provide scheduled work driven by calendar, accumulated value such as machine hours, and events such as all maintenance due for a shutdown. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have fault reports that can be put in quickly but have the capability to be followed up with lots of planning detail as well. Equipment history should be accessible quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with CMMS implementation, this is a good time to introduce simple, less expensive conditional components such as oil sampling and infrared thermography. A year into a CMMS project and with simple conditional checks, there should be enough information to start developing and harvesting KPIs and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/ca060a8d-13ea-4324-8948-f3e3af3020b2_QAM2.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 399px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Built-in navigational tools including this PM for Object Structure table enable you to see each the PM for each particular piece of equipment as well as all PMs for the equipment in its structure. IFS PMs can be to the specific object of a route and can be generated in several ways including calendar, criteria data (accumulated values such as hours and cycles as well as minimum and maximum limit values), and events such a planned shutdowns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 4 - Integrated CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level four, a maintenance organization begins to seriously consider how its CMMS interfaces with other systems in the company, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), equipment monitoring and project-management software. If a maintenance team is cutting purchase orders and doing material requisitions in an ERP while doing double entry by manually recording the costs or actually duplicating them in the CMMS, it&amp;rsquo;s time to consider investing in an integrated package or pay for direct interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a company has been planning ahead in earlier phases of development and selected a software package that offers both ERP and CMMS functionality (called enterprise asset management or EAM), it can more gracefully, cost effectively and efficiently move toward greater integration without bringing in armies of high-priced consultants and systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;If a plant has a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start considering a direct interface of data (hours, strokes, alarms). Pretty much all the monitoring programs and some CMMSs are compatible through OLE Process Control (OPC) interfacing. It makes sense to have remote sampling and real-time monitoring feed directly into the CMMS in order to cut back on the man-hours necessary to collect and enter data and to avoid misreading that leads to junk data in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the integrated CMMS phase, a maintenance organization can also look at integrating its maintenance-software tools with project-management software that can deliver equipment directly into its CMMS. This is a huge step toward greater efficiency and the ability to manage assets over its entire lifecycle from engineering, installation, commissioning, operations, maintenance and straight through the decision to refit or replace. Machine installations, plant expansions and relocations all have asset-management relevance. True Asset Lifecycle Management (ALM), or what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as &amp;ldquo;cradle-to-grave&amp;rdquo; tracking, begins at the design and/or installation level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a42881bb-6163-46fa-a66e-ad8e396d2510_QAM3.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 484px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Equipment Object Cost screen shows real-time costs on the equipment with a single click. Notice the Houston facility is highlighted showing the cost of work against the facility itself and the cost against the equipment within its structure. Clicking on any object in the structure will give you the associated real-time cost analysis without running a report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Condition-Based Maintenance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A condition-based program can be incorporated into the maintenance program in order to garner value by doing less replacement before failure and requiring less preventative-maintenance hours. We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed oil sampling and infrared thermography, which can be relatively inexpensive. Some other prevalent types include vibration monitoring and analysis, ultrasonic noise detection and non-destructive testing. These are all areas that require specific expertise and assessment on their potential value before implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of people want their CMMS to do this specific data collection and analysis for them, but this is impractical. No software can do everything effectively, and you should question anyone who says he can. The CMMS just needs to have the ability to have the data attached to it. Let the specialist specialize where it makes sense and don&amp;rsquo;t fall into that &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits-all&amp;rdquo; pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/7e558402-d205-4eeb-9cb9-05084456225c_QAM4.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 481px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 5- Quintessential Asset Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now you&amp;rsquo;re at the QAM pinnacle. You have all the tools in place to actually implement RCM. You can decide what is truly critical equipment instead of what seems like it would be according to tribal knowledge, but really isn&amp;rsquo;t. You have dashboards and key performance indicators that are real time and at your fingertips. You can make repair/replace decisions quickly and easily. You can make &amp;ldquo;run-to-failure&amp;rdquo; decisions with accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a3435b28-608a-40ee-a7f2-ae69ecac13d4_QAM5.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 449px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFS Maintenance work orders are seamlessly integrated with IFS projects, which allows an installation, upgrade or expansion project to be planned, created and monitored using IFS Projects while still having the ability to drive costs from work order to the equipment. You can also deliver the new equipment directly into equipment structure using Project Delivery.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	QAM is a model of how an asset-management program develops. You can throw all the buzzwords you want at it, but it comes down to common sense and a plan. While the right technology is important, it is your organizational culture that will really separate the wheat from the chaff and determine if you get to RCM or not. A company needs a vision of where it&amp;rsquo;s going and how to get there, other than a few rows and columns on a budget spreadsheet. The people, processes, dedication and discipline are what make a maintenance program successful. Software, monitoring equipment, reliability premises and performance indicators are just tools that automate, guide and gauge your success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>RobotWorx Debunks Used Robot Myths</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All too often companies are reluctant to consider used industrial robots as a viable automation option, despite their lower cost. Common misconceptions of used robots paint them as slow, finicky and unsupported. However, not every used robot is created equal. Robotics integrator RobotWorx debunks the used robot myths, offering its customers reliable, high-performance and fully warrantied used robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At RobotWorx we&amp;rsquo;re focused on bringing automation within reach and changing the way used robots are perceived. We take robot reconditioning and customer support very seriously,&amp;rdquo; RobotWorx President Jarrod Bichon said. &amp;ldquo;Hopefully more and more companies will give used robots a chance and take advantage of the excellent performance and affordability they offer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The secret behind RobotWorx&amp;rsquo; top-quality used robots is attention to detail. Prior to reconditioning, the acquisitions team is careful to select only robots with low hours and minimal wear. Previous work environments and applications are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once RobotWorx&amp;rsquo; team is sure they have a solid product, the real work begins. The company has developed a thorough method to return used robots to like-new condition inside and out. Each used robotic system (manipulator, controller and teach pendant) is put through a rigorous 168-point inspection and reconditioning process. All components are thoroughly cleaned, tested and replaced if need be. Finally, the entire system receives a fresh coat of paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Bichon, customers can expect to pay 40 to 50 percent&amp;nbsp;less for used robots. This makes for an even greater return on investment (ROI). Contrary to popular belief, used robots do not have to be a risky choice. Integrators such as RobotWorx have perfected the art of reconditioning and they stand by their products. Each of RobotWorx&amp;rsquo; used robots is protected with a complete warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About RobotWorx:&lt;br /&gt;
	RobotWorx specializes in building and integrating turnkey robotic workcells for different industrial uses and contexts. Established in 1992, the company has quickly become a leader in robotic integration, partnering with robot manufacturers FANUC, Motoman and KUKA in order to provide the very best for its customers.

            <title>Lubricant Market Expands to Wind Turbines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Global lubricant demand is forecast to reach 40.5 million metric tons in 2012. According to a recent study, the market is estimated at $48.8 billion. Companies in this booming market are expanding their lubricant lines to include those for more industries such as wind. Wind equipment requires specialized lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, they may require certain blends of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings in wind-power stations. One trend has been toward reducing maintenance costs and simplifying lubrication routines in the nacelle. Also, as wind turbines are built higher and in more extreme conditions, the trends is toward using low-viscosity lubricants to address cold weather effects, produce more power, and decrease micropitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, engineers are using specialty synthetics instead of mineral oils, along with particle counters to control contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reduce maintenance costs and simplify lubrication in the nacelle, operators are using one lubricant for all bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Repairs on wind turbines can be costly, difficult, and dangerous,&amp;rdquo; says Jesse Dilk, wind industry manager at Kl&amp;uuml;ber. &amp;ldquo;Therefore, it is vital to use high-quality components at every opportunity. Bearings, seals, and lubricants are essential design elements when analyzing mechanical systems. Optimizing these elements leads to a more efficient, reliable machine design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Kl&amp;uuml;ber&amp;rsquo;s high-performance grease has a blend of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings. Another adhesive grease lubricates gears in pitch and yaw drives, while reducing the risk of migration inside the nacelle and onto the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, the industry has moved toward using synthetics instead of mineral oils to minimize maintenance. &amp;ldquo;The lubricants tend to be well balanced, and have been widely tested in laboratory rigs and in the field,&amp;rdquo; Dilk says. &amp;ldquo;The preference for synthetics include high wear protection, higher efficiency from lower friction, and a wide operating temperature range. Specialty synthetic lubricants typically outperform mineral-based versions under the same conditions. Synthetics are further driven by a requirement for extended lubrication intervals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Exxon Mobil Corp. engineers also say synthetic gear oil protects against micropitting, scuffing wear, and corrosion. Synthetic oils function over a wide temperature range and resist deposit formation. Furthermore, many new lubricants and greases extend oil change intervals from a matter of months to years, which significantly reduces time and cost of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shell Lubricants also says it recognizes the significance of reduced reliability and demands of operating wind farms in remote locations (on and offshore) and in harsh climates. Their engineers have developed a variety of lubricants to withstand extremely low temperatures and protect against micropitting and bearing wear. Another trend is to monitor the oil conditions, especially in gearboxes. Shell, for example, offers an oil-analysis program that can help operators monitor the condition of their lubricant along with equipment that helps avoid unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, particle counters, such as those from Parker Hannifin Corp., provide contamination control for lubricants. Such units independently monitor system contamination trends, and give early warnings. LEDs or digital displays indicate low, medium, and high contamination levels. Such advancements, keep oil clean and increase its lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/7HwL8cGG9wM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>First Oil Reprocessing Plant in New England Almost Complete</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ROLLINSFORD, N.H. &amp;mdash; Construction at Green View Technologies is about 80 percent complete and owners are excited their dream of creating New England&amp;#39;s first oil reprocessing facility has almost come to fruition.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View President Mark Wentworth, whose family owns Wentworth Greenhouses, said the state-of-the-art plant on Green View Drive will likely be completed in mid-to-late summer, something he and others involved in the project are eagerly awaiting.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;We think it&amp;#39;s going be good for the environment and reduce the amount of used motor oil put back into it by reblending it back into new oil,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;It should be a big benefit for the area. There are no other facilities like it. The technology&amp;#39;s fairly new, and it should become very popular as environmental concerns become greater over new oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The facility received local and state approval late last year. It is designed to clean used oil to be reused in commercial lubrication purposes, and Wentworth said his company plans to sell the cleaned oil to other companies to reblend it for a variety of retail purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said the facility adds 28 new jobs to the town and has the capacity to produce several million gallons of product a year. That total includes the byproducts of the process: distillate fuel, which is heavy-metal free and will be used to run the plant as well as sold to other businesses, such as Wentworth Greenhouses; and an asphalt product that can be used for roads and roof materials.&lt;br /&gt;
	Wentworth said only about 2 percent of the product volume is unusable, as wastewater is generated by the process, while roughly 75 percent of the total product volume will be reprocessed oil, about 15 percent is fuel and the remainder is asphalt.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said this efficiency, as well as the cleaner oils, will help reduce emissions because Green View isn&amp;#39;t disposing of used oil or waste in an incinerator, as well as the fact the fuel generated by the process is cleaner and will help companies using it reduce their emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once oil is burned, the resource is gone forever,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;Our process recovers that resource and we&amp;#39;re able to use it over and over again, basically forever, so it&amp;#39;s a good thing for the environment and energy conservation because it takes less energy to reprocess old oil than to refine new crude oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	Aside from concerns about odors from the plant, which Wentworth has said they have mitigated through the design process, town officials have also expressed satisfaction about bringing the facility to Rollinsford because it will help boost the tax base and bolster the local economy.&lt;br /&gt;
	Warren Daniel, the regional manager of the state&amp;#39;s Small Business Development Center, also said he thinks the plant will be a notable addition to the area.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;I think that the plant is going to be a tremendous job creator,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the kind of company we need in New Hampshire regarding sustainability and regarding bringing energy production to this country.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Small Business Development Center as well as the Southeast Economic Development Corporation assisted Green View in developing a business plan and secure financing for the project, the cost of which Wentworth declined to disclose.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View financed part of the project through two different loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration, as well as through a $480,000 loan through the community development block grant program.&lt;br /&gt;
	The block grant, loaned to Green View through the SEDC after the state and town approved the use of the grant, is the first-ever for Rollinsford, according to SEDC Executive Director Dennis McCann.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said that milestone is important because he said the facility could not have been built without the block grant, which is a federal program that funds projects that, among other things, benefit low-income circumstances and/or work toward the betterment of the community.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said he was grateful to have been a part of the process, and said he is looking forward to &amp;quot;celebrating&amp;quot; the end of the construction with Wentworth because Green View has been in the works for about 2 1/2 years.&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a while,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re pretty excited to participate in New England&amp;#39;s first recycling plant for lubricating oil, especially when other areas of the country (and world) have these facilities and we don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/maintenance_and_reliability/~4/GTSL0cJGWfg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
