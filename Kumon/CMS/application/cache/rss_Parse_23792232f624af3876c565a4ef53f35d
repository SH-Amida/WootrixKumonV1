    <title>Spam Trail Leads to Chinaâs Three Largest Banks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546311/spam-trail-leads-to-chinas-three-largest-banks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A researcher made 300 purchases of fake luxury goods online and found that 97 percent were handled by Chinaâs largest three banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An academicâs investigation into the underpinnings of the fake luxury goods spam that pollutes in-boxes, social networks, and search results sheds new light on the economics of online crimeâand implicates some of the largest banks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Is Facebook About to Kill Off Twitter?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546286/is-facebook-about-to-kill-off-twitter/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is struggling to grow, its executives are leaving in droves, and now Facebook looks to be muscling in on its turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitterâs stock price has been tumbling for months, and CEO Jack Dorsey announced this week that several of its highest ranking executives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-managementchanges-idUSKCN0V20ZF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are fleeing&lt;/a&gt;. The deepest concern, though, isnât about corporate machinationsâit seems that the product itself simply isnât as compelling as Facebook. Walt Mossberg, one of the better-known tech pundits anywhere, said Twitter had become way too complicated to use and called it â&lt;a href=&quot;http://recode.net/2016/01/27/mossberg-twitter-has-become-secret-handshake-software/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret-handshake software&lt;/a&gt;â that only people who invest huge amounts of time can get full benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Uber and Lyft Are Still Trying to Avoid Acting Like Regular Employers</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the most prominent names in the gig economy continue to struggle with their labor practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest questions in the gig economy is whether giants like Lyft and Uber will be forced to treat their contracted drivers like regular employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>No One Knows How Much Cybercrime Really Costs</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545696/no-one-knows-how-much-cybercrime-really-costs/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A lack of reliable figures on the costs of many kinds of cybercrime is holding back companies and governments from responding appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Grum botnet of several hundred thousand compromised computers was taken down by law enforcement in 2012, it was responsible for sending out 18 billion spam messages per day, mostly hawking pharmaceuticals such as Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>China Hit by Rise of Attacks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545666/china-hit-by-rise-of-attacks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;China sees a major increase in infections on file-sharing sites and more targeted, localized malware threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China-based hackers are sometimes accused of being behind major external attacks like the one on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538201/cyber-espionage-nightmare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acts of corporate espionage&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>New Rapid Response Systems Blunt Cyberattacks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545641/new-rapid-response-systems-blunt-cyberattacks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Limiting damage from attacks requires far faster reactions, quick notification of victims, and adherence to regulations. Managing all that can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason breaches do so much damage is that they often remain undiscovered for monthsâan average of more than 200 days, according to research by the security firm Mandiant. Over time, a once-minor breach can become a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>How PayPal Boosts Security with Artificial Intelligence</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545631/how-paypal-boosts-security-with-artificial-intelligence/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The payments giant keeps fraud losses  below industry averages by teaching computers to play detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To PayPal, the transactions signal fraud: a U.S. userâs account is accessed in the U.K., China, and elsewhere around the world. But PayPalâs security systemâthanks to a growing reliance on an artificial-Â­intelligence technology known as deep learningâis now able to spot possible fraud without making mistakes. Thatâs because algorithms mine data from the customerâs purchasing historyâin addition to reviewing patterns of likely fraud stored in its databasesâand can tell whether, for example, the suspect transactions were innocent actions of a globe-hopping pilot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Can We Insure the Internet of Things Against Cyber Risk?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545736/can-we-insure-the-internet-of-things-against-cyber-risk/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Software with security flaws, and a lack of historical data on risks, have made the Internet of things tough to insure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insuring the security of connected products is hard for a simple reason: they are too new, and too little is known about the economic losses or personal injury they might cause. What the industry needs is data, and analytics to translate statistics on losses into policy standards and consistent pricing. Only then can emerging industries like self-driving cars and network-connected medical devices really take off, says software security expert Josh Corman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>How an Overreaction to Terrorism Can Hurt Cybersecurity</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545716/how-an-overreaction-to-terrorism-can-hurt-cybersecurity/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Encryption could have prevented some of the worst cyberattacks. Giving back doors to law enforcement will make matters worse, argues Bruce Schneier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many technological security failures of today can be traced to failures of encryption. In 2014 and 2015, unnamed hackersâprobably the Chinese governmentâstole 21.5 million personal files of U.S. government employees and others. They wouldnât have obtained this data if it had been encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Europe Raises Barriers to American Data Transfers</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Citing Snowden, a European court throws into doubt whether many U.S. companies can easily haul European data across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October the European Unionâs highest court invalidated the data protection agreement known as Safe Harbor, which had allowed 4,332 American companies to transfer the personal data of the European Unionâs 500 million citizens back and forth across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Finding Insecurity in the Internet of Things</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The world of connected devices is growing fast, but how secure is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we connect everything from &lt;a href=&quot;http://proxy.oddonion.com/index.php?q=uggcf%3A%2F%2Foyhrobk.pbz%2Furyyb-oneovr-ncc-uryyb-frphevgl-vffhrf%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barbie dolls&lt;/a&gt; to front-door locks and cars to the Internet, weâre creating moreâand possibly more dangerousâpotential ways for cyberattackers to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Half-Measures on Encryption Since Snowden</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545636/half-measures-on-encryption-since-snowden/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid a wave of corporate privacy and security pronouncements, 2014 was supposed to be the âyear of encryption.â It didnât pan out that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the NSA subcontractor Edward Snowden released classified documents in June 2013 baring the U.S. intelligence communityâs global surveillance programs, it revealed the lax attention to privacy and data security at major Internet companies like Apple, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Warrantless surveillance was possible because data was unencrypted as it flowed between internal company data centers and service providers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Venture Capitalists Chase Rising Cybersecurity Spending</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545626/venture-capitalists-chase-rising-cybersecurity-spending/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Investors have been pouring money into companies selling ânext-generationâ security products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash of headline-grabbing cyberÂ­attacks on major companies over the past few years has made one thing abundantly clear: itâs not enough to rely only on traditional security tools. To venture capitalists, that means thereâs money to be made by betting on startups developing new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Why Weâre So Vulnerable</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545621/why-were-so-vulnerable/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An expert in U.S. national cybersecurity research and policy says the next generation of technology must have security built in from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an age of continuing electronic breaches and rising geopolitical tensions over cyber-espionage, the White House is working on a national cybersecurity strategy thatâs expected in early 2016. Helping to draft that strategy is Greg Shannon. He was until recently chief scientist at Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Software Engineering Institute and is now on leave to serve as assistant director for cybersecurity strategy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Cybersecurity: The Age of the Megabreach</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545616/cybersecurity-the-age-of-the-megabreach/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;We havenât stopped huge breaches. The focus now is on resilience, with smarter ways to detect attacks and faster ways to respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In November 2014, an especially chilling cyberattack shook the corporate worldâsomething that went far beyond garden-variety theft of credit card numbers from a big-box store. Hackers, having explored the internal servers of Sony Pictures Entertainment, captured internal financial reports, top executivesâ embarrassing e-mails, private employee health data, and even unreleased movies and scripts and dumped them on the open Web. The offenders were said by U.S. law enforcement to be working at the behest of the North Korean regime, offended by a farcical movie the company had made in which a TV producer is caught up in a scheme to kill the countryâs dictator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Giant banks are experimenting with software inspired by Bitcoin, and Microsoft wants a piece of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week a consortium of 11 giant banks including UBS and Credit Suisse announced that they had completed their first trial run of the idea of using software inspired by the digital currency Bitcoin to move assets around more efficiently. It was also a test of what Microsoft thinks could be a significant new business opportunity. The experiment, coordinated by a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://r3cev.com/&quot; target=&quot;0&quot;&gt;R3 CEV&lt;/a&gt; using Bitcoin-inspired software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethereum.org/&quot; target=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;, took place inside Microsoftâs cloud computing platform, Azure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
