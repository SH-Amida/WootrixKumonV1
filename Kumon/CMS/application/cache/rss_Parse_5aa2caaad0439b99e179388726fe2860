<ol><li>Designing/building a large brewery/restaurant complex with emphasis on sustainable design on a somewhat limited budget presented a challenge.</li><li>To consistently deliver a high-quality final product, a brewery needs to maintain tight ranges of temperature and humidity for its brewing, fermenting, aging, and storing operations.</li><li>Another challenge involved concealing/de-emphasizing utilities (e.g., piping, ductwork) in the restaurant and brewhouse buildings to preserve building aesthetics.</li><li>Excessive carbon dioxide levels in the production building could build up from the fermentation and bottling processes, thereby causing potential harm to occupants.</li><li>A product meant for human consumption, such as beer, needs to be pure and made from high-quality ingredients.</li></ol>
<b>Solutions </b>
<ol><li>A variety of cost-effective techniques were implemented to enhance the sustainability of the brewery complex including reuse of process wastewater, reuse of waste-process heat, natural ventilation, evaporative cooling, and destratification fans.</li><li>To address the issue of maintaining tight ranges of temperature and humidity for operations, sophisticated HVAC systems with multiple heating/cooling zones were implemented to ensure that ambient conditions would meet the individual requirements of the processes contained within each space. Integrated building controls were implemented for the entire site to precisely control and monitor building temperature and humidity and to trend data over time.</li><li>To minimize visual impact, ductwork was placed in unobtrusive locations, such as through trusses, grille returns were placed high on walls, natural gas piping was placed above radiant heaters in the restaurant patio, and potable water for the restaurant/bar was distributed under the floor.</li><li>To reduce potential harm to occupants caused by a buildup of excessive carbon dioxide, monitoring and mitigation protocols were implemented including moving pickup points lower to the floor for this relatively heavy gas.</li><li>To further promote product sanitation and quality, process compressed air and steam are filtered to eliminate potential contamination and a reverse osmosis polishing tank removes impurities from the local water source to deliver incomparable water purity.</li></ol>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="uploads/RTEmagicC_PE1603_Web_Img_AssetManagement_SmartwareGroup.jpg.jpg" width="300" height="216" alt="In a Black and Veatch survey, 10.7 percent of utilities organizations said they werenât prepared for security issues, and worse yet, 21.8 percent said they didnât know. Courtesy: Smartware Group" title="In a Black and Veatch survey, 10.7 percent of utilities organizations said they werenât prepared for security issues, and worse yet, 21.8 percent said they didnât know. Courtesy: Smartware Group" txdam="238331" style="padding: 10px; float: right;" />When we talk about security in the 21st century, we're referring to two different kindsâthere's physical security, as in protection against outside threats that&nbsp;might harm a facility or its assets, and there's cyber security.
Both appear to be a source of concern to the utilities industry these days. The provision of North American Electric Reliability Corp.&nbsp;Critical Infrastrucure Protection (NERC CIP-014-1) became effective Jan.&nbsp;26, 2015, providing a structured framework whereby utilities must identify their most critical assets.&nbsp;Utilities must document all potential threats and risks related to those assets, and then design and execute a comprehensive plan to safeguard the assets. Both the identified assets and protection plan are required to be verified by a third party. 
Chip Handley, project manager for powerâgeneration services at Black and Veatch, told Breaking Energy that the government regulations regarding utility asset management security are a step in the right direction, but it might be difficult for organizations to achieve the level of compliance they need.
<b>Security for both large and small utilities</b>
There's been much more emphasis in recent years on ramping up security resources for the utilities industry.&nbsp;In a recent Black and Veatch survey about security, 10.7 percent of companies said they weren't prepared for security issues, and worse yet, 21.8 percent said they didn't know.
It was initially thought that only larger organizations could afford to invest in security, but that mindset is now beginning to change. In reality, utility companies of many sizes can invest at varying levels as they see fit.
&quot;Security planning, both physical security and cyber security, is often influenced by the size of the respondent's organization or customer base,&quot; Handley said. &quot;Without a mandate in place, small- to mid-size utilities felt the combination of their limited impact to the grid and the lack of staff to address cyber security concerns justified implementation delay.&quot;
<b>Compliance becoming a more serious issue</b>
Under the new provisions handed down from Washington, utility companies are under a great deal of additional pressure to identify security risks and address them quickly.
&quot;Greater awareness of system interconnection is forcing municipally-owned utilities and co-ops that previously had been outside the scope of NERC-CIP to evaluate their network to determine whether they are compliant,&quot; Handley said.
More companies than everâincluding large, small, public and private utilitiesâare being forced to meet security standards that weren't on their radar previously. It's a frantic time for the industry at large, as many organizations are scrambling to audit their physical assets. This can require a great deal of money, manpower and logistical legwork.
<b>Single system of record</b>
When it comes to asset management documentation and audit preparation, utilities organizations typically have a ready-made solution at their fingertips with a modern computerized maintenance management system&nbsp;(CMMS). Assetâmanagement functionality, complete with configurable criticality, status categories, conditions&nbsp;and other attributes, can greatly assist with the critical assetâidentification process for compliance. Communication is key, of course. By maintaining these attributes within the CMMS and delivering user access across the enterprise, all necessary personnel can best understand the type of security precautions designated for each critical assetâeven highlighting these updates through CMMS dashboard messages for particular facilities, users, sites, or other filter options. 
Audit capabilities prove useful for unaffiliated third party access, in which organizations can leverage an add-on occupational safety &amp; health (OSH) CMMS solution to track date/time/user/modification logs, inspection schedules, and historical record keeping.
Every business these days needs to do something about security, and the utilities industry is certainly no different. By tapping into the go-to system of record, organizations can extend their well-designed CMMS beyond typical corrective and preventive maintenance to drive greater compliancy and build a safer structure for all stakeholders.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Using nothing more than the built-in microphones and speakers of standard computers, researchers were able to transmit passwords and other small amounts of data from distances of almost 65 feet. The software can transfer data at much greater distances by employing an acoustical mesh network made up of attacker-controlled devices that repeat the audio signals.</div>
<div>âThe concept of a covert acoustical mesh network renders many conventional security concepts useless, as acoustical communications are usually not considered,â said Michael Hanspach and Michael Goetz from Germanyâs Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing, and Ergonomics and the <link http://www.jocm.us/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=124&id=600 _blank external-link-new-window "Opens external link in new window">authors of a paper on the subject</link>. âWe constructed a covert channel between different computing systems that utilizes audio modulation/demodulation to exchange data between the computing systems over the air medium. The underlying network stack is based on a communication system that was originally designed for robust underwater communication. We adapt the communication system to implement covert and stealthy communications by utilizing the near ultrasonic frequency range.â</div>
<div>The researchers developed several ways to use inaudible sounds to transmit data between two Lenovo T400 laptops using only their built-in microphones and speakers. The most effective technique relied on software originally developed to acoustically transmit data under water. Created by the Research Department for Underwater Acoustics and Geophysics in Germany, this adaptive communication system (ACS) modem was able to transmit data between laptops as much as 19.7 meters (64.6 feet) apart. By chaining additional devices that pick up the signal and repeat it to other nearby devices, the mesh network can overcome much greater distances.</div>
<div>The ACS modem provided better reliability than other techniques that were also able to use only the laptopsâ speakers and microphones to communicate. There was one issue with the technique, and that was a transmission rate of about 20 bits per second, a tidbit of standard network connections. That level of bandwidth does allow for the transmission of video or any other kinds of data with large file sizes. The researchers said attackers could overcome that shortcoming by equipping the Trojan with functions that transmit only certain types of data, such as login credentials captured from a keylogger or a memory dumper.</div>
<div>The smaller level of bandwidth could transfer data such as keystrokes, and that is all a hacker could need to set up an attack. It is one thing to point out the attack, but it is another to also establish how to stop the assault. One defensive measure should be to switch off audio input and output devices. A second approach, according to the paper, is to employ audio filtering that blocks high-frequency ranges.</div>]]></content:encoded>

			<description>Maintenance and monitoring are just two of the six ways.</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="uploads/RTEmagicC_easelly_visual__7__01.jpg.jpg" txdam="95719" title="Six ways to optimize energy usage in refrigeration systems. Courtesy: CFE Media with information provided by Luke Facemyer." alt="Six ways to optimize energy usage in refrigeration systems. Courtesy: CFE Media with information provided by Luke Facemyer." clickenlarge="1" style="padding: 5px; float: right;" height="248" width="320" />Refrigeration costs account for the majority of a plantâs total electrical costs, often exceeding 60% of total operating expenses. As energy costs continue to increase, more and more food processors are realizing the need for energy optimization and monitoring as a way to increase productivity and lower energy costs.&nbsp;
<b>Optimizing the entire systems</b>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">The key drivers in managing energy efficiency are reducing operational costs, utilizing existing systems to reduce equipment costs, analyzing the ROI for new controls system upgrades, and conducting a power quality assessment. </span>
<span style="font-size: 12px;">Most refrigeration systems are designed to optimize the efficiency of each individual component rather than looking at the entire system as a whole and ensuring that all components work together efficiently. Many processors add new equipment without regard to the impact on the total system, leading to wasted energy and operational inefficiencies.&nbsp;</span>
<b>Top six&nbsp;ways to save energy&nbsp;</b>
<b>Maintenance:</b> Conduct regular maintenance to check for dirty filters, broken sensors, failed insulation and other malfunctions that could be wasting energy.
<b>Monitoring:</b> Know how much, when and where energy is being used. Install &nbsp;alarms and monitoring systems to identify inconsistencies and trends that could be wasting energy.
<b>Energy Recovery</b>: Capture wasted heat from condensers and turn it into energy.
<b>Water Savings:</b> Manage and reclaim the water thatâs evaporated from your condenser.
<b>Operations:</b> Change your set points or put in controls to do it automatically to better manage processes and efficiency.
<b>Design:</b> Select the proper equipment based on size and compatibility, install VFDs
<b>Energy audits â energy efficiency checklist</b>
Perhaps one of the biggest advantages of automation is the ability to optimize the entire system to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs. By collecting and analyzing data, technicians can identify systems that are running in an inefficient manner and correct them.&nbsp;
Technicians can manage the control and sequencing of all equipment to maximize energy efficiency. They can run trend analyses, alarm logs, energy management data, and runtime reports in real-time to improve the efficiency and reliability of your entire system.

			<title>Autonomous maintenance: The peril of eliminating a department</title>
			<link>http://www.controleng.com/single-article/autonomous-maintenance-the-peril-of-eliminating-a-department/79729d5fbd27ea18e9252b6fd81d2f6e.html</link>
			<description>Rick Wheeler, a Principal Consultant with Life Cycle Engineering, explains how autonomous...</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Companies are still pursuing the dream of autonomous maintenance as taught by Tokutaro Suzuki in his book âTPM for Process Industry.â The theory is that basic tasks such as cleaning, inspecting, tightening, and <img src="uploads/RTEmagicC_PE312126_MC.jpg.jpg" width="300" height="205" txdam="95403" title="PE312126_MC" alt="PE312126_MC" style="padding: 10px; float: right;" />lubricating can and should be done by equipment operators because they are the equipment owners and are closest to the equipment on a daily basis. 
The Reliability Excellence model reveals many aspects of this concept, and our clients have implemented and benefited from this âoperator careâ concept. This has also helped clients deal with the shortage of maintenance trades through shifting tasks that donât require years of training and special tools to the appropriate persons and allowing the maintenance professionals to focus on the work that best utilizes their skills. 
But can the concept be taken too far? If operators can do basic maintenance tasks why canât they do more? Hereâs a cautionary tale of what happened to one manufacturing organization when they built a new facility. They hired a mix of people with mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, and operations backgrounds and trained them all on maintenance practices. 
In the beginning they also had a central maintenance group that was responsible for rebuilds and specialized maintenance. This worked relatively well for a period of time. People tended to specialize in their original trade but there was good collaboration, and people were able to work in other trades.
But the product demand decreased. The company asked: âHow can we trim our workforce to accommodate the new business environment?â The answer was to let them go. The company limped along for the next two years. Maintenance wasnât being done quite as well or as fast, but they had lots of time and capacity to meet the demand. And things started to get better.
Over time the market demand for the product increased. At the same time, the market price decreased. Now the plant was getting busier making more products, but making less money on each product. Of course, managementâs directive was to meet the demand and cut the manufacturing cost. And for a while they did. They still had a little extra time to make the volume, and they deferred and canceled some maintenance tasks. It was all fineâuntil one day when it wasnât.
Now the plant needed to run at capacity to meet the demand. The years of neglect and poor maintenance were taking their toll on the equipmentâs ability to operate as it had when new. The maintenance skills that were taught, but seldom used, were now forgotten. There was an increasing 
pressure to perform, driving employees to stay in their comfort zones. Those with operations backgrounds just wanted to operate. Instrument techs no longer wanted to help replace mechanical seals or gearboxes. But since there was no core maintenance function they had to look for external contract support.
So how did they unwind this situation? The first step was to perform a skills analysis to&nbsp;determine what capabilities still existed. Those people were then reassembled into mechanical&nbsp;and instrumentation teams.&nbsp;The planning process was restarted to make sure the most important&nbsp;maintenance work was being addressed. This was supported by the reliability engineering&nbsp;function as the engineers began to perform root-cause analysis on critical failures and design out&nbsp;chronic failures.
The elimination of some of the reactive work, and an increase in wrench time gained from proper&nbsp;planning and scheduling, allowed more PM and PdM work to be done. 
A decision was made to continue to contract some&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;maintenance &nbsp;such as welding, facilities electrical work, buildings, and grounds maintenance, but the focus was returned to the care and maintenance of the critical process equipment. Great care, however, was taken to maintain the original intended operator care practices.
Autonomous maintenance does have a valid role in the modern maintenance strategy. Its goal is to have clean equipment that is maintained in like-new condition by the operators of equipment. This improves housekeeping, improves the safety and environmental performance, and allows early detection of failure. It also frees up valuable maintenance craft time to focus on precision maintenance and failure elimination. &nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

			<description>Engineers in the U.S. design professions and construction trades are seeing base salaries go up in...</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[ Produced in partnership with the American Council of Engineering Companies' state member organizations, ZweigWhite's 2014 Salary Surveys of Engineering Firms breaks down data by location, industry, and job role. Different compilations are offered across three regions in the U.S.
 For example, the survey of Northeast and South Atlantic engineering firms shows salary increases for entry-level staff, project engineers, project managers, department managers, and principals, in the civil engineering, structural engineering, and environmental disciplines. Department managers and environmental engineer and scientist principals saw the biggest increases.
 The Central region salary survey records show pay increases as well. The most notable increases occurred for project managers in the environmental engineering discipline, with the median base salary growing more than 17 percent from 2013 to 2014. Principals in the environmental discipline also saw significant median salary increases of 12.7 percent. The median salary for project managers at structural engineering firms grew to more than 10 percent, from $81,640 in 2013 to $90,000 in 2014.
 Although the salaries of principals in the Mountain and Pacific region remained among the highest in the U.S., base salary level increases were hard to find, and some positions even experienced drops in pay. Project managers in the structural engineering discipline saw small decreases, and the median salary for project managers in the environmental discipline saw decreases of 11.36 percent from 2013 to 2014.]]></content:encoded>
