            <title>SPM Instrument Introduces New Vibration Enveloping Technique</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SPM Instrument recently launched a new high-definition vibration enveloping technique for detection of early stage gear and bearing faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A complement to traditional vibration analysis, HD Enveloping utilizes engineered algorithms for digital signal processing, preserving the true highest peak of the vibration signal. Signals buried in machine noise are revealed through high-definition digital enveloping, extracting and enhancing the signals of interest from the overall machinery vibration signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Used to monitor applications in the 15-20,000 revolutions per minute range, the HD Enveloping technique can be employed with existing vibration transducer installations and easily integrates into industrial infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unit of measurement is HD Real Peak, which is a scalar value expressed in decibels. Representing the true amplitude levels found in the envelope signal, HD Real Peak is the primary value used for determining the severity of a given damage as well as for triggering alarms. Spectrums and time signals also provide a snapshot of machine condition to alert the maintenance department of a potential problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The setup of the HD Enveloping measurements in the diagnostic software is straightforward. A set of predefined filters are available for easy selection, with each designed to detect damages or anomalies in different stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>GE Monitoring and Diagnostic Team Saves $70 Million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/3/26/e986f8ea-a380-495d-a77a-cb0aca4df874_GE-center.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 267px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;General Electric (GE) recently announced that operational data from its fleet of more than 1,500 gas turbine and generator assets translated to customer savings estimated at $70 million in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE&amp;#39;s monitoring and diagnostics center collects more than 30,000 operating hours of data every day and features a team of more than 50 engineers who analyze more than 35,000 operational alarms per year. Among the activities monitored at the center are the inlet temperature of a compressor, thermal performance of a gas turbine, temperature of combustion exhaust, dynamic tones of the combustion system, vibration levels of a rotor and the temperature of bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our monitoring and diagnostics team and capabilities play a key role in helping GE customers operate their power plants at high levels of performance and reliability,&amp;quot; said Justin Eggart of GE&amp;#39;s Power Generation Services business. &amp;quot;Our team takes a holistic approach to what we call &amp;#39;predictive maintenance,&amp;#39; which focuses on helping customers sidestep operational barriers before they occur, no matter what type of equipment they are managing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Drawing on the experience of hundreds of thousands of resolved cases, GE&amp;#39;s monitoring and diagnostics team has developed dozens of physics-based algorithms that provide early warning of more than 150 potential failure mechanisms. This wealth of understanding, blended with application of statistical methods, has enabled the team to continually improve the algorithms, thereby increasing the probability of detection while reducing false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2014, the monitoring and diagnostics center served 502 customer sites in 58 countries, providing assistance more than 8,000 times and helping power plant customers achieve their desired outcomes with reliability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have operational data flowing in continuously from the fleet, and we are in constant contact with our customer sites as well as our broader engineering teams,&amp;quot; added Eggart. &amp;quot;Oftentimes, the collaboration between our engineers and customers leads to the fastest and most complete resolution to the issue at hand, and we appreciate those interaction opportunities that our services enable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring and diagnostics center monitors technology and equipment not only from GE but also Nooter/Eriksen, Flowserve, Emerson, Delaval, Byron Jackson and others.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Increase Machine Reliability with Vibration Monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/14/334c1f59-e61c-444a-b162-697e2e4cb46b_vibration-monitoring.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 385px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Machine failure, which is typically the result of incorrect installation and maintenance of components and equipment rather than normal wear and tear, is often due to shafts being misaligned, rotating parts being incorrectly balanced or an inappropriate frequency and/or type of lubrication. However, these common problems can be easily prevented by using appropriate testing and maintenance equipment, such as alignment tools and automatic lubricators, and by applying advanced, but not necessarily expensive, condition monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Condition monitoring is a powerful solution that enables efficient predictive maintenance. The long-term reliability of countless manufacturing and process systems depend on it. Monitoring devices allow plant operators to react swiftly to impending failures within the system. Therefore, an effective condition monitoring regime is an essential part of any machine maintenance program. Within the field of condition monitoring, most engineers would agree that the most important procedure is vibration monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Vibration Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration monitoring is firmly established as a key tool for plant and equipment maintenance. For example, in some circumstances where vibration is carefully monitored, it is possible to extend operating life beyond recommended maintenance intervals, while in others the detection of a rapid increase in vibration can help avoid catastrophic failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Providing the capability to detect fractional changes in the operation of rotating components via vibration monitoring is one of the most effective preventive maintenance measures an engineer can take. Increases in vibration indicate deteriorating operating conditions, such as wear or misalignment. Vibration sensors, also known as accelerometers, can quickly identify these changes with exceptional accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Accelerometers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accelerometers can be used as either in-line or hand-held instruments and are increasingly easy to install and use. Today&amp;#39;s accelerometers are robust and reliable devices with stainless-steel sensor housings that prevent the ingress of moisture, dust, oils and other contaminants. They also have the capability to operate over a wide temperature range, measuring high and low frequencies with excellent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two main categories of vibration sensors or accelerometers: AC accelerometers and 4-20-milliampere (mA) accelerometers. AC accelerometers are typically used with data collectors for monitoring the condition of higher value assets, while 4-20 mA components are commonly used with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to measure lower value assets, such as motors, fans and pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern vibration sensors and associated equipment can address the specific needs of many applications and are built to withstand challenging conditions within a range of industries. For example, certain AC sensors can provide an ideal monitoring solution in the food and beverage industry, as the enclosures meet strict hygiene standards while the technology within offers the right capability for measurement. Additional options are available for vibration monitoring at low speeds, where the signals generated by bearings are harder to detect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The potential uses of condition monitoring are expanding because many devices are now sealed to a high ingress protection rating, which allows their use both indoors or outdoors in contaminated conditions. Sensors sealed to the highest ingress protection ratings enable monitoring in a wide range of applications, including pulp and paper, power, food and beverage, hydrocarbon processing, oil and gas, machine tool, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A vibration sensor has been compared to a car&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;check engine&amp;quot; warning light, prompting the predictive maintenance technician to perform root cause analysis on the machine to determine what kind of problem might be affecting its performance. If the engineers ignore the warnings in order to continue production, the eventual costs of unplanned downtime and major repairs will far exceed those that would have been caused by a short, planned period of preventive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By utilizing these tools, plant operators can increase efficiency by enabling maintenance engineers to spend more time focusing on other duties that will boost profitability for the business, as opposed to carrying out maintenance schedules on non-critical machines at frequent intervals. A good vibration monitoring system allows operators in the manufacturing and process industries and beyond to keep semi-critical machine assets up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Machine failure can have a massively detrimental effect on production lines because even the failure of one component can hold up the whole line. While vibration monitoring is a powerful tool wherever it is installed, it is even more valuable in preventing downtime in production lines that include any kind of bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of vibration monitoring equipment has been driven primarily by the changing needs of its customers around the world. Among the industrialized economies, there has been a steady move in recent years from reactive to predictive maintenance. This is now evolving into a far more strategic approach that is effectively process-wide, encompassing every stage in the production process in a bid to maximize uptime and productivity while reducing operating costs. Sensors are an essential part of this process. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/IU5oANmfZS8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF Introduces New Wireless Condition Monitoring Sensor</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recently launched a new wireless machine condition sensor that provides dynamic vibration and temperature data for condition monitoring and machinery diagnostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Wireless Machine Condition Sensor has ATEX Zone 0 certification, which means it can be used in hazardous environments, such as those found in petrochemical, oil and gas, or pharmaceutical plants. The device combines both a sensor and router node into a compact, battery-operated unit the size of a typical industrial accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sensors communicate with each other and with a wireless gateway, creating a mesh network. This type of network and communication protocol is ideal for monitoring rotating machinery throughout large plants, in hard-to-reach locations or in areas where traditional Wi-Fi communications will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once data is collected, the WirelessHART gateway communicates with the supplied wireless sensor device manager software. The device manager then automatically exports the data into a comprehensive diagnostic and analytic software package where a plant engineer can analyze the data and determine a course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The new SKF Wireless Machine Condition Sensor offers monitoring capabilities that may be impossible with wired systems or hand-held devices,&amp;quot; says SKF&amp;#39;s Jan Hendrik van der Linden. &amp;quot;This can ultimately lead to reduced condition monitoring costs as well as to a safer approach to machine monitoring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF Machine Condition Indicator Named Product of the Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/3/18/224f9fc0-3237-4a3e-aaa5-431e9cebf17f_skf-MCI.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 221px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;SKF recently earned a Design News Golden Mousetrap award for its Machine Condition Indicator (MCI). The condition-monitoring tool, which offers a cost-effective and easy-to-use method of monitoring machine health, was voted &amp;quot;Best Product of the Year&amp;quot; in the test and measurement category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Golden Mouse Trap Awards recognize companies, products and people who are energizing North American design, engineering and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are delighted that the MCI has received this award,&amp;quot; said SKF&amp;#39;s Torsten Bark. &amp;quot;The SKF MCI is the result of some extremely successful development work, resulting in a sophisticated yet simple tool. On one hand, the SKF Machine Condition Indicator is as simple as a &amp;#39;check engine&amp;#39; light. On the other hand, an advanced algorithm prevents the unit from false alarming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A low-cost vibration and temperature monitoring device, the SKF Machine Condition Indicator is designed for rotating machinery with constant operating conditions. It provides the ability to track basic machine health on assets that are not currently being monitored on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By utilizing the condition-monitoring tool, plant operators can save time and money by freeing up maintenance engineers to spend less time on problem detection and more time focusing on root cause analysis and other more significant issues.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF Launches New Condition Monitoring Thermometer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/13/1e7ad841-e621-45b3-98da-8dd49a2f4245_skf-thermometer.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 578px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;SKF has launched a new condition monitoring thermometer designed for operator-driven reliability (ODR) maintenance tasks on bearings, gearboxes and other critical machine components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TKDT 10 is a compact, accurate instrument for measuring temperature by direct contact and offers a wide measurement range, from minus 328 degrees F to 2,501 degrees F (minus 200 degrees C to 1,372 degrees C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the ability to allow two temperature probes to be connected, the device can display two measurements simultaneously along with their temperature difference and minimum, maximum or average values to further support the measurement task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While contact temperature devices are not typically supplied with a probe, the TKDT 10 comes equipped with the TMDT 2-30 temperature probe, which is also suitable for many applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The thermometer also features a large back-lit liquid-crystal display (LCD) to ensure that temperatures can be seen in poorly lit environments with the possibility to freeze the display to further enhance easy reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The TKDT 10 is a valuable instrument for use in ODR programs or by the maintenance team,&amp;quot; says Mark Ely, SKF product manager. &amp;quot;Supplied with a high-quality temperature probe, users can be confident in obtaining fast, easy and accurate machine temperature measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Luneta Introduces New Lubricant Inspection Pod</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/30/88318974-7849-47cc-879d-9d8cccd51a63_luneta-for-web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 299px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Luneta recently launched a new multi-parameter inspection device for modernizing and expanding daily lubricant inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Condition Monitoring Pod (CMP) is a visible inspection window that reveals critical health conditions of the lubricant and machine. Its proprietary design provides an improved method of inspecting the health of machinery without the need for laboratory analysis. The offering is part of the company&amp;rsquo;s plan to introduce a series of inspection-related products over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a platform of 16 capabilities, including 10 that are exclusive to the tool, the CMP features a built-in oil sampling port, an easy-to-remove-and-view magnetic plug, a corrosion/varnish inspection probe and a quick lubricant access point for syringe sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Best applications include gearboxes, bearing oil sumps, hydraulic reservoirs, compressor oil reservoirs, turbine-generator main oil tanks and paper machine central reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We believe that Luneta has re-invented the sight glass by turning it into the focal point of machine condition monitoring,&amp;quot; said Luneta CEO Tom Fitch. &amp;quot;The Condition Monitoring Pod makes oil analysis as simple as performing daily machine inspections.&amp;nbsp;A sight glass should not&amp;nbsp;be limited to simple oil level inspections.&amp;nbsp;Instead, with the CMP, an array of critical machine and lubricant conditions can be examined in just seconds.&amp;nbsp;And, it signals the beginning of Luneta&amp;rsquo;s vision to enhance machine reliability through the development of groundbreaking inspection technologies.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF Launches Laser Vibrometer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/12/5/d260841b-14dc-4e6f-a1f3-075365598aa5_laser-msl-7000-for web.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;SKF recently launched a digital, single-box vibrometer that offers service engineers a flexible tool for collecting vibration measurements in a large number of field applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developed specifically for non-contact vibration measurements, the Laser Vibrometer MSL-7000 meets the need of those who wish to conduct end-of-line noise testing for their products, especially for noise-critical applications such as fans, electric motors, pumps and household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The single-unit meter design is easy to integrate into test setups and existing control systems, and covers acoustic measurements from 0.2 hertz (for slow rotations) up to 22 kilohertz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The MSL-7000 can also be used for mobile condition monitoring, together with the SKF Microlog series, where it enables non-contact measurements that could not be taken previously, such as for measurements on hot surfaces and through glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The SKF Laser Vibrometer can help customers who need advanced and flexible vibration measurement, regardless whether they are doing retrofitted quality inspection or if they are doing vibration measurement in difficult locations,&amp;quot; says Werner Palmetshofer of the Condition Monitoring Center in Steyr, Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because it employs non-contact measurement, the MSL-7000 is significantly less subject to wear, making it an efficient and cost-effective tool.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Acoustic Monitoring to Prevent Downtime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/7/25/31a9cebf-b377-4aa0-b32a-8bc1745478ab_MHC Memo Pro.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 214px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;As&amp;nbsp;one of the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s largest independent flour millers, Whitworth Bros. Ltd. (WBL) prides itself on its ability to supply customers with high-quality food-safe products.&amp;nbsp;WBL has also recognized the importance of monitoring key elements of its plant equipment to ensure the company is able to meet customer demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2009, WBL made the decision to invest in an acoustic monitoring system in order to move from a reactive to a proactive maintenance strategy. Part of this undertaking was to employ a&amp;nbsp;condition monitoring (CM) technician to roll out the system across its&amp;nbsp;production sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WBL wanted the best technology available to minimize any potential for unplanned production downtime. The company considered various monitoring options, including vibration and temperature, and attended numerous trade shows before eventually discovering the Holroyd instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WBL started collating data-capture routes across all its sites and within a short period of time began data acquisition and analysis. With the analysis software, new data could be quickly downloaded and compared against historic data for all machines in each production area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once data-acquisition routes were established, condition monitoring of the production-critical plant began. This enabled WBL to take a proactive approach to monitoring and maintaining equipment at the company&amp;rsquo;s other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic monitoring system readily identified machines that were in need of remedial action. Machines that were thought to be beyond routine servicing were withdrawn from service as part of a planned maintenance activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection now takes place on a regular basis for all critical plant machinery. This allows&amp;nbsp;engineering resources to be directed to the plant in need of maintenance. The process is organized as part of a planned, proactive activity, rather than as the result of a machinery breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WBL utilizes a suite of sensors that are compatible with the acoustic monitoring system. The standard magnetic-mounted sensor is used to collect the vast majority of information, with the handheld, extended probe enabling data capture in hard-to-reach areas. Low-profile sensors have also been installed to allow critical plant data to be gathered. All three sensors are readily connected to the system, and data can be captured almost instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/7/25/5c405772-f8db-4213-bf58-c8c32611b8dd_Wellingborough_site[2][2].jpeg" style="width: 616px; height: 270px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WBL currently performs routine monthly data captures, which are supplemented with weekly collections for any machines suspected of having an underlying bearing issue. One-off readings help to correctly diagnose individual machine issues as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coverage at one of WBL&amp;#39;s sites includes the collection of data spanning 2,500 separate data points. This ensures a comprehensive dataset, which allows machine condition trending to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WBL has&amp;nbsp;devised a cost-metric calculation to assess the savings from the newly implemented condition monitoring activity.&amp;nbsp;This has proven beneficial in helping to justify the expenditure and resource costs allocated to this particular CM strategy. The results show that the CM approach has significantly&amp;nbsp;reduced the potential for&amp;nbsp;unplanned production stoppages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company is now investigating technology that would allow condition monitoring of oscillatory equipment (flour sifters) and will continue to watch further advances in an effort to minimize future plant breakdowns as well as maximize production efficiency across all its sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/rCYvpVqxIKY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Value of Reliability as a Service</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The success of condition-based maintenance programs depends on the ability to drive collaboration among users and experts, and distribute results to decision-makers while having a dependable infrastructure to ensure security, reliability and flexibility. Cloud-based business infrastructures like software as a service (SaaS) can play a significant role, making it easier to share information and support a stable, actionable and sustainable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While cloud computing is sweeping through enterprises for just about every application, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance (PdM) are no different. In fact, the PdM industry potentially stands to gain more from the cloud revolution than most any other industry. To date, PdM systems have been primarily isolated to individual laptop and desktop computers. PdM was completely left behind in the client-server boom of the 1990s. By moving to the cloud, PdM systems are gaining the advantages associated with the cloud, including cost savings, accessibility, collaboration and productivity. Enter reliability as a service (RaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RaaS is a solution that utilizes the broad reaches of cloud-based resources to give more insight into the necessary tasks of the people responsible for plant performance, safety and operations. Whether this includes giving certified analysts access to data to allow for collaboration on fault diagnosis, gaining second opinions from analytics experts, tracking events from fault diagnosis through repair process or relaying risk assessment and business metrics to management, RaaS overcomes collaboration obstacles associated with resource accessibility and driving communications across key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	RaaS Adoption Made Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To encourage greater adoption, RaaS models allow plants to license an application for use as a service on-demand through a subscription model rather than purchasing hardware and software to run stand-alone applications. In the RaaS model, plants need only a computer or a server to download an application and Internet access to run the software to take full advantage of centralized data management, power and security infrastructures coupled with collaboration tools and direct access to certified PdM experts. Despite being a relatively new term to the industry, plant management and reliability and maintenance professionals need to familiarize themselves with RaaS, as it enhances operational efficiencies, improves safety, keeps PdM programs and technology current and drives return on investment (ROI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The catalyst behind plants&amp;rsquo; increasing interest in RaaS is the reduction of capital costs while assuring access to the latest technology. This provides a level of service that delivers reliable information and analysis with universal accessibility to information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. RaaS technology enables the &amp;ldquo;always on&amp;rdquo; business culture and removes the responsibility of implementing and maintaining an information technology (IT) infrastructure, which requires hardware investments beyond traditional data-collection hardware, software licensing, support and training costs. Rather than spending time managing an IT network &amp;ndash; a function plant personnel are not specialized to handle &amp;ndash; RaaS frees maintenance professionals to focus on reaching their reliability and uptime goals without the distraction of IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Collaboration and Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though RaaS has considerable cost benefits, plants that rely on the cloud solely for that reason are not reaping the full benefits of the technology. The first and most important reason plants should evaluate RaaS is because it enables managers and employees to collaborate and share the results of their maintenance and reliability efforts in real time. Instead of sharing information among a small group in the maintenance or engineering department, machine condition health information can be accessed by all stakeholders, including external experts in the enterprise or local plant at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With greater transparency, the condition-monitoring program becomes synchronous with improving operations that are essential to plant availability and uptime goals. RaaS is accessible to personnel from operations, management, maintenance and engineering who are then in a position to make informed decisions that affect plant production and outage planning. This ensures the plant runs smoothly and managers outside the condition-monitoring program always have the most current machine condition information and, as a result, the knowledge to make well-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, ACME Industrial Services is an integrated plant reliability maintenance company that uses RaaS to centralize all of its field engineers who are stationed all over the world. ACME&amp;rsquo;s central facility in India is fully integrated with the field engineers by using a predictive maintenance RaaS solution hosted by Azima DLI in Tukwila, Wash. At the central facility, engineers provide machine condition analysis support, and the results are published within the cloud. Customers can then view detailed condition information for their machines within their local plants rather than relying on spreadsheets delivered by email or other analog channels. In this example, the cloud provides an infrastructure that allows the Indian services company to streamline its workflow and better serve its clients from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Jumping into the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overcoming the fears of even the most risk-averse IT professionals, cloud computing has proven to be a secure and effective technology. With the right education and experienced partner, a plant can easily become more comfortable about the safety, security and reliability of its data in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The keys to alleviating cloud fears are to evaluate the potential RaaS partner&amp;rsquo;s network and security model and see how well it maps to the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. The customer&amp;rsquo;s IT department should be directly involved in these discussions from the start. The IT department will partner with plant personnel to develop a specific set of criteria to evaluate the RaaS offering within the plant&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure. Following are some questions that can be helpful to ask when evaluating a cloud service provider&amp;rsquo;s model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do you clearly understand how the cloud computing offering works from the RaaS vendor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor meet the IT security model of your plant?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does your plant have the delegated ability to control access to their system?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will your plant have clear lines of communication with the vendor for sales and technical support needs?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Does the vendor have a structured change management and patch management process?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Can I obtain a copy of my data if I need to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How accessible and knowledgeable is technical support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Admittedly, RaaS is still at nascent stages of adoption for predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring initiatives, so it&amp;rsquo;s recommended that plants &amp;quot;do their homework&amp;quot; and implement a thorough evaluation of a potential partner. Customer support, uptime and security protocols should be at the forefront of discussions when evaluating vendors, especially if this is the first foray into the cloud. A good RaaS partner is critical, as it will be the key in helping achieve the performance and budget goals that will catch the eye of senior management and keep predictive maintenance and condition-monitoring programs running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SKF Unveils Intelligent Bearing Technology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recently launched SKF Insight, an intelligent bearing technology that enables bearings to communicate their operating conditions continuously with internally powered sensors and data-acquisition electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These innovations are set to revolutionize condition monitoring for bearings, especially in critical machinery and technically challenging applications,&amp;quot; says Tom Johnstone, SKF president and CEO. &amp;quot;SKF Insight technology will make condition monitoring more widely available, especially in applications where it was previously impossible or impractical. With our integrated diagnostic technology, our customers can get even better control over the life cycle of their machinery, leading to lower total costs with higher reliability and machinery uptime.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Previously, condition-monitoring techniques could only monitor damage after it had occurred. Now, by sensing directly on the bearing, SKF is able to monitor the damage from the first microscopic effect as it is happening. With this information, users can take remedial action to reduce the reason for bearing damage, adding lubricant, mitigating transient overloads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, by monitoring the load directly on the bearing, SKF Insight makes it possible to measure the actual load the bearing experiences rather than the load for which it was designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A global supplier of bearings, seals, mechatronics, lubrication systems and services, including technical support, maintenance and reliability services, engineering consulting and training, SKF is represented in more than 130 countries and has approximately 15,000 distributor locations worldwide.

            <title>SPM Instrument Introduces New Condition Monitoring Device</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/12/21/dbe14419-e59a-4be5-9aa0-956b5370af8b_LeonovaDiamond.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 645px; float: left;" /&gt;SPM Instrument recently introduced its next generation of handheld measuring devices, the Leonova Diamond. The portable, heavy-duty instrument is designed for condition measurement in rough industrial surroundings. It is the first portable device to offer the SPM HD measuring technique for condition monitoring of rolling element bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The instrument also boasts sophisticated vibration analysis capabilities, with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and razor-sharp spectrums even where signals are weak and low in energy content. The wide frequency range, covering from 0 to 40 KHz, enables measurement where absolute position is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For machinery with journal bearings, the Leonova Diamond reliably measures dynamic and centerline movement of the shaft. Multi-channel measurement enables the use of triaxial transducers and multi-axes vibration monitoring while cutting long measuring routes down to a minimum of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On machinery operating under variable speed, the device&amp;#39;s order tracking functionality provides reliable data and clear measuring results under large RPM variations. Corrective maintenance techniques such as run up-coast down measurement, shaft alignment and dynamic balancing can be added to the instrument as optional modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Leonova Diamond is the latest proof of our commitment to developing first-class condition monitoring products for more profitable maintenance,&amp;quot; said Stefan Lindberg, managing director of SPM Instrument. &amp;quot;In a direct response to feedback from SPM customers worldwide, we developed a durable, high-performance instrument that will deliver long working life under the toughest, most demanding circumstances.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ludeca Introduces Wireless Condition-Monitoring System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/9/11/59623d17-04ed-49b3-81e0-619f51ab4492_Ludeca_Vibconnect-RF_PressRelease2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 457px; float: right;" /&gt;Ludeca recently introduced a new wireless condition-monitoring system for machine components that is designed to optimize the availability of plant equipment, improve equipment reliability and reduce unwanted maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Vibconnect RF wireless system measures machine vibration, bearing condition and temperature, and transmits the relevant data to the bridge where it is evaluated. The system not only monitors the condition of roller bearings and other rotating components, but also detects damage caused by cavitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Vibconnect bridge acts as the central receiver, processing the data from the sensor units and transmitting it through the operator&amp;#39;s network for visualization and archiving. For the evaluation of received data, the system includes a range of comprehensive analytical functions that enable the operator to assess machine vibration, temperature and bearing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any irregularities or faults found in the machine components are directly recorded and forwarded to the relevant control center. This allows asset damage to be detected at an early stage so prompt corrective action can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>IMI Launches Vibration Monitoring System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/7/5/2a501ec8-8386-4d53-905f-e5a7231c15c9_IMI Echo image.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 203px; float: left;" /&gt;IMI Sensors recently introduced the new Echo wireless vibration monitoring system, which is designed to allow users to monitor the health of critical machinery more frequently and safely than walk-around systems while helping to reduce downtime and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Requiring no gateways, mesh or repeaters, the system uses extended range radio frequency (ERRF) technology to transmit long distances in typical plant environments. It transmits at only 0.75 milliwatts effective radiated power (ERP) in the unlicensed 900 megahertz band and does not interfere with other wireless communications such as Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of wireless vibration sensors, a junction box, a receiver and monitoring software. Each wireless vibration sensor can be programmed to transmit data at a pre-determined interval, and a lone receiver is capable of accepting data from hundreds of sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Users can transmit data from existing analog inductively coupled plasma (ICP) accelerometers using the 8-channel wireless junction box. The transmitted data set features overall vibration measurements scaled in acceleration, velocity, true peak and crest factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring software allows predictive maintenance (PdM) professionals to establish alarm values, plot vibration data over time, generate reports and receive email alerts. By using the alarm panel included in the software, PdM professionals can see the status of all monitored points at a glance and focus valuable manpower on analyzing faulty machines rather than taking data on healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobius Awarded Accreditation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced that its board of certification has been awarded accreditation by International Accreditation Foundation (IAF) member JAS-ANZ, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17024 and ISO 18436-1, to provide vibration analysis certification per ISO 18436-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mobius Institute Board of Certification (MIBoC) is an independent entity within the Mobius Institute organization that is directed to ensure Mobius and its authorized training centers deliver training and certification that meet or exceed the requirements defined by ISO 18436-1 and 18436-2 standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through an extensive audit and review process by Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ), MIBoC was awarded accreditation. Accreditation awarded by an IAF member organization, under the IAF Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA), ensures mutual recognition of accredited certification between signatories to the MLA and are recognized worldwide based on their equivalent accreditation programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute joins Vibration Institute of the United States and British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing (BINDT) as being accredited to provide certification to vibration analysts according to ISO 18436-1 and 18436-2. Based on a review of previous certification records, JAS-ANZ has declared that all Mobius Institute certified analysts in more than 126 countries are qualified to receive a revised certificate that recognizes their achievement as being certified in accordance with ISO 18436-1 and ISO 18436-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Accreditation is a significant milestone for Mobius Institute and our family of worldwide authorized training partners,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;We have worked hard to develop a practical and impartial certification scheme, so it was particularly gratifying when JAS-ANZ recognized that our previous certification practices met the requirements of the relevant standards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Saving Time and Money with Condition Monitoring </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent acoustic emission (AE) study identified a potential critical bearing failure that became a planned preventive action for a leading food manufacturer. This also avoided considerable cost and unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic emission equipment and the main tool used during the planned inspection routes were manufactured by Holroyd Instruments. This example will show the value of this type of equipment in avoiding a major unplanned event that could have had massive cost consequences for the business. Collateral damage to the associated equipment would have proved very costly, and the lead time to rebuild could have caused extensive downtime that would have meant disgruntled customers not being able to rely on stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story began in April 2010 when some initial elevated readings were noted at two node points on a large step-down transfer gearbox that were sampled on a seven-day routine. The distress readings were elevated and triggered the alarm level. They were of concern and evident on subsequent inspections. The third elevated reading that was part of an upward trend instigated a planned work order in the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) to investigate and take further action. This equipment could not be taken out of service lightly, as it was at the time constrained by high production demands. Experience with a sister line&amp;rsquo;s previous planned bearing change also played an important part in the escalation of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/9947803a-3bb4-493b-9873-9b1e92eff658_gearbox.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 558px; height: 352px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The input side of a transfer gearbox is shown with the output bearing node point on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On more detailed inspections, it was determined that the bearing with the highest distress was indeed the suspected output bearing. Audible clicks were loud and clear at the output end bearing. The two bearings at the node locations were on the drive line of the motor at the input and output ends of the transfer gearbox. The adjacent bearings on the large, helical step-down gear were still reading low and had no audible clicks. The engineering manager was advised that there was an anomaly on one of the input bearings, that the others were in good condition and that production could continue with targeted condition monitoring. The routine oil sampling was increased from monthly to every two weeks. AE inspections were increased, with spectrum readings now on a four-day cycle. This would give some comparative evidence when the new bearings were eventually fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned change of the bearing set was arranged with the production planner, maintenance manager and product specialist. It became clear that the equipment would have to operate for at least another six months until it became available. Contingency plans were formulated for an emergency change if any of the AE readings or oil samples showed advances toward failure. Warnings were issued that this could occur rapidly if the bearing failed. A new bearing set was purchased, and a meeting was scheduled with the bearing manufacturer to examine the used bearings when they were eventually changed in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AE readings stayed at an elevated level during this long waiting phase, and oil sample results showed no elevated readings in the key elements associated with roller bearing failures. During the weeks before renewal, many spectra were taken from all points of the gearbox for future evaluation. This would rule out frequencies from the oil pump and other components around the assembly. An AE envelope spectrum graph before the bearing change is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/254014f7-f16e-44dd-96f8-d80ead41bf1d_spectra 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 630px; height: 209px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As can be seen, there was something creating a spike at 73Hz, which happened to match the frequency of the bearing race. This provided a clue that there was a race surface defect of some kind and not an element breaking down or the cage disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing change finally took place, and the production plant was turned around within 12 hours so that the equipment did not incur any unplanned downtime. The used bearing set was returned with the transfer gearbox, and the two units were degreased. On first inspection, they both looked similar and in good order. The elements and cages were then dismantled from the outer and inner races, with care taken to keep them in order and in the correct aspect for reassembly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It became clear that on the suspect output bearing, a major spall on the inner race had developed, and every element was pitted with the debris that had emitted. At this point, a representative from the bearing manufacturer was invited to visit and examine the bearings. He concurred that the bearings had lasted very well considering the atmosphere and heat in which they had operated for almost 10 years. This would be considered an end-of-lifetime mode of failure. It may have lasted many more months or could have accelerated to failure within days or weeks. The photograph below is of the spall that measured approximately 10 mm in length and 2.5 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/3a11d97c-28b7-4388-aa85-57dc40e9a028_spall damage.jpeg" style="width: 630px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Spall damage to the race is shown above with feathered edges and surface pitting in the loaded area of the spalling. Note the next layer of material on the right-hand side that would have given way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the remedial work had been completed, additional spectrum samples were recorded and monitored to learn more. Carpet noise levels were lower, and the decibel scale was a third of the previous graph example. The maximum peak was now less than 0.4 decibels, while the carpet level was less than 0.2 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the systems and tools relied on every day proved effective in capturing this anomaly before it turned into a major event. The key to this was the full involvement of engineering with operations to plan in the remedial work with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the lessons learned were that the inspection frequencies at seven-day intervals were correct for this critical plant, the preventive action was started at the earliest opportunity, the equipment enabled the pinpointing of the bearing fault, the audio facility allowed a second reference that linked rpm with the audible clicks and that this all gave sufficient evidence for the planned work to commence at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root-cause analysis was carried out directly after the bearing change was completed to investigate any future recommendations for servicing this equipment. It was decided that as the bearings had reached their end-of-life cycle, there was no need to alter any future planned maintenance. Condition monitoring with AE had provided the confidence to pick up any anomalies at a very early stage in the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spectronics Unveils New Ultrasonic Diagnostic Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/3/4b487c90-6acf-4ab2-9000-a3c935d39191_MDE-2000 Marksman II for web.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 246px; float: left;" /&gt;Spectronics Corporation recently introduced a new ultrasonic diagnostic tool that converts and amplifies inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; sound. The MDE-2000 Marksman II allows a technician to &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; even the smallest compressed air, natural gas, propane tank, vacuum, steam and other pressurized leaks before they lead to major breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tool uses a two-tiered approach to ensure accurate diagnosis. The receiver converts inaudible ultrasonic sound into audible sound using heterodyne circuitry. The unique Sound Signature Technology then fine-tunes the audible sound into the natural sound emitted by the leak itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 5-LED signal intensity indicator and audible alarm pinpoint the exact source of the problem. An Internal Noise Control (INC) feature safeguards against ambient noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Marksman II comes with an ultrasonic receiver, full-sized headphones, a hollow air probe, a solid contact probe and an ultrasonic emitter that helps locate faulty seals, gaskets and weatherstripping in doors, windows, ductwork and other non-pressurized enclosures. All components are packed in a sturdy carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also offers a MDE-2000NC Marksman II model, which is equipped with heavy-duty, noise-canceling headphones for extremely noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>LumaSense Introduces Dissolved-Gas Analysis Monitors </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	LumaSense Technologies Inc. has introduced a new line of dissolved-gas analysis (DGA) monitors that allow electric utilities to more effectively reduce outages caused by faulty load tap changers (LTCs) and transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new SmartDGA platform uses non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas-sensing technology and features a unique hardware design that reduces installation time. It is designed to help utilities achieve widespread condition monitoring across generation, transmission and distribution assets at a cost significantly less than traditional DGA monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first monitor in the new line, the SmartDGA Gauge, will be the industry&amp;#39;s first dedicated online gas monitor for LTCs. It requires no carrier gas, no frequent calibrations and can be retrofitted to LTCs to provide asset condition status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We believe a smart grid begins with an optimized supply network in the utility grid,&amp;quot; said Vivek Joshi, LumaSense CEO. &amp;ldquo;This means having reliable assets in the generation, transmission and distribution networks globally. The SmartDGA Gauge provides valuable information about load tap changers on a real-time basis, which is very important if we&amp;#39;re serious about bringing concepts like the smart grid to reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LumaSense also provides a range of fiber-optic temperature sensors used to monitor winding hot spots, as well as continuous thermal-imaging systems that remotely monitor substations. Utilities can deploy these technologies to predict and correct faults as part of a condition-based maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mobius Introduces Machine-balancing Training Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mobius Institute has announced the release of iLearnBalancing, a computer-based training product that teaches maintenance professionals how to perform in-place dynamic balancing of industrial machines. The training is delivered by DVD or through the Web via the iLearn-online learning portal and is run on a personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The software is designed to provide complete understanding of the different types of unbalance, including static, couple and dynamic unbalance, as well as what is needed to correct them. It also offers ways to ensure that you are not chasing the wrong solution during the balance process, how to tell if a machine is truly out of balance and whether there&amp;rsquo;s another fault condition with similar symptoms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s iLearnInteractive product line, iLearnBalancing features extensive 3-D animations and simulators to make the subject more interesting and understandable. The interactive course is fully narrated, making it easier to learn. Simulators are used so you can experience the interaction between unbalance, rotational speed and phase, and how they affect the balance vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, machine balancing has been as much an art as it has been a skill,&amp;rdquo; said Jason Tranter, Mobius Institute&amp;rsquo;s founder and managing director. &amp;ldquo;iLearnBalancing demystifies machine balancing in an easily understandable format so that maintenance technicians learn everything they need to be successful. A well-balanced machine experiences less wear and has a longer life cycle, thus improving your plant&amp;rsquo;s overall availability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What You Should Do Before a Plant Closure</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s happened &amp;hellip; the announcement that a major portion of your facility is being closed for the foreseeable future. What do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accept the news that your plant is facing an impending plant shutdown. It is not necessarily a &amp;ldquo;knockout&amp;rdquo; for the plant or your career. Remember, in the often uneven battleground called the global marketplace, just about anything can happen. Be ready to get up and start fighting again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Designate responsibility to an individual for writing a list of possible scenarios. The individual should have enough clout to implement the chosen strategy, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Go to the top of the company and request that sufficient funds be made available to execute the initial shutdown and preservation strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Choose the right type of long-term equipment caretakers. Those selected are often security or ex-supervisory types rather than experienced operator/craftsmen with intimate knowledge of the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;rsquo;t allow critical components to be pirated (stolen for use elsewhere) if part of a larger plant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove all process materials. Even innocuous materials left in the unit in the long term will likely cost five times more than at the initial shutdown. The current operations people are familiar with all the hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Seek expert advice on equipment preservation resulting in not getting the best bang for the buck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve the hourly workforce in the shutdown and mothball plan. Almost unbelievably, our recent experience has been that if the decision to shut down at some future date has been made, then involving operators and mechanics can very much improve both the quality of the shutdown plan and its execution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Not only record but clearly and physically mark what has been done to preserve the item of equipment during deactivation. The reactivating crew (probably a different group of people) can easily miss that a filter, line blind, internal component, etc., has been removed or added with serious consequences at a future start-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our experience, idle plants with small crews operating at a very relaxed tempo can be dangerous places. Make sure safety programs and routine audits are kept active to avoid accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as with any critical situation, a long-term strategic approach coupled with a series of medium-term tactics and detailed plans are needed. You should also consider how long the shutdown is probably going to last (guesstimate) and whether the plant will most likely be restarted, sold as a complete unit or sold piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examine every item or class of equipment individually and write a specific initial storage/mothball technique plus a methodology for ongoing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the purposes of this article, let&amp;rsquo;s consider an item of equipment or a whole plant that might restart as early as six to nine months but could also be several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unused plants and equipment that are properly prepared for shutdown and left in fairly good condition can retain much of their value. However, if a plant is left &amp;ldquo;as is&amp;rdquo; and allowed to deteriorate, as is normally the case, much of it can be fit only as scrap in just a matter of months. Engaging in a well-planned process of deactivation/mothballing can be worthwhile either way, whether it should ever be reactivated or just sold for its second-hand value at some future point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Materials and Equipment You Will Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having a clear view of how the constant foes of galvanic/bio corrosion, mold, mildew, etc., can be mitigated if not defeated is essential. Although much will depend on local conditions, the wetter and colder situations are much more challenging in terms of handling humidity, while blowing dust is an issue for those in the high desert regions. For this article, we will consider a central United States or European location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A useful analogy in developing a strategy is to compare what it takes to maintain fire. In the case of fire, there are three essential legs: heat, a fuel source and oxygen. Likewise, age-related deterioration involves a driving force (such as galvanic action), a conducting medium (electrolyte) and oxygen. The fundamental approach to stopping or slowing this age-related deterioration is to remove one or more of the three legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In simple terms, we aim to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Separate dissimilar metals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Protect surfaces that could be attacked, even with a covering of only a few molecules thick.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dry out or remove the conducting medium (electrolyte &amp;mdash; air or gas). Corrosion cannot occur when parts are stored in environments where the relative humidity is held below 40 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove any oxygen or sources of chemical or biological attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The materials we can use are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Liquid protective waxes and liquid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coating &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These can be sprayed on any clean, dry surface to protect them. Wherever it is applied, PVC will form a tough, flexible, waterproof skin that will withstand the extremes of temperature, thermal shock, differential substrate movement and impingement even when sprayed on webbing to form a cocoon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCIs) &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These generate protective vapors even at room temperatures. They come in a number of convenient forms, including time-release vaporizers, sprays, plastic bags and films, powders, oil additives and coatings. They are adsorbed onto the metallic surfaces of the equipment (just a few molecules thick), where they can prevent corrosion for up to two years. While most VCIs are environmentally friendly and create no safety hazards for employees, there are some that are suspected of being harmful. Most contain no toxic substances, such as nitrates or chromates. (Note: Volatile organic compounds should not be used in combination with a desiccant.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Vapor space inhibitor (VSI) &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;This is an oily concentrate that can be added to lubricating oil systems (internal combustion engines, etc.) when equipment is not going to be completely filled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Heat-shrinkable plastic films &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are ideal for enclosing individual machines that have been cleaned and dried and have internal desiccants added.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;VCI-covered polythene films &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used to wrap individual smaller components.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Chemical oxygen scavengers &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are frequently added to fresh water used to displace more corrosive liquid in systems that can&amp;rsquo;t be effectively cleaned or dried out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Chemical inhibitors &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are added to liquids and chemicals and are designed to remove unwanted products while preferentially inhibiting their attack on the body of the container. (Antifreeze sometimes used in this process contains them.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Desiccants &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These include numerous substances (solids) that absorb water from gases (air) or liquids.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Biocides &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used to prevent microbial growths in water and fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Light waxes &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used as surface protectors for metals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Sacrificial Anodes &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;These are used in tanks that cannot be drained of their contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The primary pieces of equipment are dehumidifiers. These are available in two forms: those that work on the refrigeration principle and those that use two-cycle rotary (wheel) heated desiccant absorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Strategies by Equipment Class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before considering individual techniques, make a best guess of the duration and whether it is going to be an &amp;ldquo;attended monitored&amp;rdquo; lay-up or a &amp;ldquo;walk-away&amp;rdquo; lay-up. This article is simply a guide and is not intended to be totally comprehensive and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tanks, Pressure Vessels and Pipework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is essential that tanks, pressure vessels and pipework be left as clean and dry as possible. Insert line blinds to create manageable zones that can be slightly pressurized (0.5 psig+) using nitrogen or dry air. Include some small flow and arrange for some simple telltale mechanism to show pressure flow and the level of humidity (indicator cards). For large enclosures, use a commercial dehumidifier of an appropriate capacity. For vessels, tanks and containments that must be kept full of liquid, some form of oxygen scavenger or anti-biological growth chemical can be used (see boilers). If a pipework system contains any traps, have its internals removed and clear all strainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Boilers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boilers can be laid up using either the long-term dry method or the hydrazine wet lay-up method, which involves leaving the wet side (boiler, economizer and super heater) full of feed-treated water. The feed water is dosed with 15 percent hydrazine and then pH-adjusted to raise the alkalinity to a minimum pH of 8.3. The fire side is supplied with heated air, with desiccant as a backup. Both water-side and fire-side points should have new gaskets, except for furnace hot-air entry inspection and exit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Pumps, Engines, Compressors and Machinery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To minimize internal corrosion, close off all vents and openings, and completely fill the casing with the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommended lubricant. Alternatively, add a volatile corrosion inhibitor in the correct proportion to the lubricating oil. For large compressors, turbines, etc., first centrifuge/circulate the existing oil using a portable filtration cart through water-absorbing filter elements to remove any free water. For diesel and gasoline engines, drain the fuel systems and add biocide to the remaining fuel. To prevent external corrosion, if unpainted, one of the recommended spray-on coatings should be used (either a light wax or liquid PVC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Instruments/Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintaining the driest possible conditions for both electronics and external field devices, including sensors, transmitters and valves, can be achieved by strategic placement of desiccant packages and sealing the enclosures. This should be supplemented by placing small containers of VCI powder wherever possible. These will not adversely affect electronics. Instruments that normally would be in contact with the process materials should be removed, cleaned, protected and marked for immediate local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Electrical Enclosures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seal and insert bags or wraps of desiccants and containers of volatile corrosion inhibitors. Alternatively, heat using individual strip or built-in heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Motors and Generators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean the exterior, grease and apply a protective covering. If completely sealed, add packets of desiccant. Lift carbon brushes from commutators/slip rings. Where sleeve-type bearings are fitted, a VSI concentrate should be added to the lubrication system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Exercising and Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the time involved, it will be necessary to periodically exercise equipment by rotating it several times and leaving it at a different (90-degree) angle. Where humidity controls have been set, these need at least weekly monitoring. Where chemical controls are used, these should be checked every three months. Periodic monitoring of motor/generator internal resistance, as well as tank oxygen levels and humidity levels, is necessary for long-term lay-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Auxiliaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases, various fire-protection systems and alarms still need to be maintained and powered up. Fires are common in dried-out cooling towers. If batteries are normally used, disconnect them and smear the terminals with petroleum jelly. Vented-type lead-acid batteries should first be fully charged, then drained and flushed with distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Final Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent discussion with two major plant-dismantling/second-hand equipment vendors revealed that currently there are very few people looking for used equipment, and many idle plants are being offered for sale. They reported that when the decision to shut down comes, most companies remove anything that could present an immediate danger but essentially close the doors and walk away from millions of dollars&amp;rsquo; worth of equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/gNUtJHO1oq0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>People Make the Difference in Maintenance and Reliability Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people may have gravitated to the maintenance and reliability industry because of the desire to work with machinery. I was trained in engineering and understand how machines operate and work. Machines behave in logical ways. They all follow the mechanical and electrical laws of nature. Engineers are immersed in those laws in their years of schooling. People in the maintenance field thrive on knowing that machinery works and behaves in logical ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article for &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, I pointed out the thought similarities between an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety improvement effort and a maintenance and reliability improvement effort. The idea that zero injuries are possible is a key concept for any safety effort to gain momentum, but how does a plant or an organization really improve safety results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I have experienced over the past 30 years is a continual and steady safety improvement effort. In the early years, much of the emphasis was on identification and elimination of unsafe conditions. The focus was on the machinery and the physical facility. The elimination of unsafe conditions was a normal and comfortable task for many in plant operations, production and maintenance. It was easy to identify and fix defects in machines and facilities that could cause an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our efforts in these areas were successful and improved safety. However, we still experienced injuries. Many of these injuries were not caused by unsafe conditions but by the unsafe acts of our employees. As our organization recognized this fact, more work and concentration was put on preventing injuries due to unsafe acts. We have used various programs to improve our results in the past. Several of the programs used were the STOP program and TAKE 2 program, both created by E.I. DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past several years, we used a program that concentrated on people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors by enlisting these people in observing each other. These observations help remind everyone to think and behave safely. The emphasis was on changing the culture and attitude of the organization as well as on the people and how each person behaves. We have seen substantial improvement in safety results over the past few decades due to this focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similarity in leading a maintenance and reliability improvement effort and a safety improvement effort. Today, many of these maintenance and reliability improvement efforts are solely concentrating on the machinery. The program leaders may become enamored with the new technical tools that have exponentially become more capable and less expensive in the past 30 years. The condition-monitoring tools and precision-maintenance tools have dominated the industry&amp;rsquo;s attention in the past several years. Many others have focused on the analysis processes such as reliability-centered maintenance and root-cause analysis. All of these tools and programs are fairly technical and logical in nature. The tools and their application are very comfortable to maintenance and reliability leaders, managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Certainly, any effort needs to have competency in these technical skills. The need to understand how machinery operates, how it can fail and how to prevent failure is extremely important and foundational to any improvement effort. However, this aspect is the easiest part to lead an organization in the maintenance and reliability improvement effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe the most difficult but most beneficial aspect of leading the maintenance and reliability improvement effort is managing the change process in organizations. The behavior change process from a reactive state to a proactive state is a challenging transition. Leadership of this change process needs to focus on each employee&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. This certainly is not a comfortable action for most leaders. Employees must believe that machine failures can be prevented by proper design, operation and preventive maintenance strategies. This attitude change is facilitated by continual education on the fundamentals of maintenance and reliability principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, success leads the organization eventually to believe that zero failures are possible. When this belief takes hold, the organization begins to accelerate toward a true proactive state. Each person in an organization is important to enlist in this change endeavor. It happens one person at a time through various stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changing an organization&amp;rsquo;s behaviors and actions on a daily basis is one of the key areas that will accelerate the maintenance and reliability process. Are you and your organization&amp;rsquo;s leaders educated in change management principles and ready for this needed behavior change effort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/UGYixQBxbT8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Kittiwake Launches MHC Bearing Checker</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kittiwake recently announced the launch of its MHC Bearing Checker, a small handheld device that can provide instant indication of machinery condition. The acoustic emission-based instrument is designed as a cost-effective solution to monitoring an unlimited number of machines on a periodic basis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on the detection of high-frequency activity that is naturally generated by deterioration in rotating machinery, the MHC Bearing Checker&amp;rsquo;s Distress parameter removes the need for machine-specific interpretations. If the Distress parameter is greater than 10, the user knows there is a problem and can instigate further checks. A decibel level is also provided, giving an indication of the overall noise of the bearing, which increases with the rotation speed as well as with degradation of the bearing or inadequate lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Each measurement takes approximately 10 seconds and requires no setup, previous history or knowledge of machine design details such as bearing type, number of balls or race diameters. The same Distress interpretation is applied across all machine types, effectively &amp;ldquo;deskilling&amp;rdquo; the technology so maintenance professionals can take a proactive approach to predictive maintenance and make informed decisions quickly and with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides entry-level condition monitoring at a price that makes it a feasible addition to every engineer&amp;rsquo;s back pocket,&amp;rdquo; says Martin Lucas, Kittiwake Group&amp;rsquo;s managing director. &amp;ldquo;This is a simple, cost-effective means of spotting problems in bearings, gearboxes, motors and pumps at an early stage, ultimately saving the company money by avoiding downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The unit is powered by an internal rechargeable battery, offering up to 1,000 measurements between charges. Recharging is accomplished through a micro USB port. The device can be connected to any standard PC USB port for ease of recharging.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The MHC Bearing Checker provides an instant indication of machinery health, but the real value stems from collating historical data and trending,&amp;rdquo; Lucas adds. &amp;ldquo;Devising routes and analyzing results over time enables a better understanding of machinery and creates real intelligence on how the bearings react to changes in operation, how issues develop and how long it will last until complete failure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Acoustic Emission: The Next Generation of Vibration Techniques</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	History, experience and familiarity count for a lot where conditioning monitoring is concerned, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate the need for change, innovation and the advancement of tried, tested and trusted techniques. The late Steve Jobs commented: &amp;ldquo;Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity, not a threat.&amp;rdquo; Condition monitoring (CM) is transforming rapidly and so too must the mindset of CM practitioners and users. It&amp;rsquo;s not good enough to simply disregard a disruptive technology in an effort to protect the &amp;ldquo;old guard.&amp;rdquo; When combating downtime, there&amp;rsquo;s no place for historical sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steadily disrupting traditional vibration techniques is acoustic emission (AE). AE technology spawned from the aviation industry where vibration analysis simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easily applied, short of a suicidal maintenance technician hanging off the wings. AE technique is based on frequencies much higher than are monitored in the repetitive, synchronous movement of vibration. These frequencies are the result of shock, impact, friction and cracking, for example. By this means, it is possible to detect impending failure before damage occurs, as well as monitoring its progress thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With well-defined ISO standards, traditional vibration techniques including vibration monitoring and vibration analysis have provided a trusted approach to condition monitoring for the past 30 years. Yet, it remains a complex science and requires sophisticated knowledge and understanding from a seasoned expert. In contrast, AE technology extends and simplifies the science, placing the power of vibration techniques directly into the hands of every engineer. Signals can be processed at the AE sensor into an easily understandable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, vibration analysis (VA) as a technique will have a place for many for years to come for many end users. However, there is no escaping the fact that there is often a requirement for a costly and unsustainable level of knowledge required to affect a good diagnosis. For VA, the defect repetition frequencies are critically dependent upon the machine component design and geometry, as well as the precise running speed. Vibration can occur independently in the X, Y or Z axis, and so orientation of the sensor is as important as location. For a detailed interpretation, it is also necessary to know internal machine geometries, shaft speeds, meshing frequencies, etc., and to analyze the data before making a diagnosis. So in summary, VA is valuable but too often overly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/22/4b96d88a-ffba-4a63-8758-d92a7a616bd2_AE and VA.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 388px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/22/766741ef-f413-4efb-ada4-2685de7453ab_AE.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 405px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With acoustic emission (AE), signal processing is undertaken automatically at the sensor level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/22/14a5d756-7be9-4324-9269-88385a7834fd_VA.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 421px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With vibration analysis (VA), the signal is processed downstream manually or semi-automatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The areas in which vibration and AE both apply can be illustrated as overlapping circles. However, AE provides an earlier warning, detecting wear and small defects, whereas with vibration, damage must have occurred to detect a signal. AE will pick up a lack of lubrication, friction and cracking, which vibration will not, although it must be acknowledged that the totality of information obtained from AE will be more limited than that derived from vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The signal processing required by AE is not something that can be performed by just anyone; it&amp;rsquo;s a high-frequency signal, so the user must have the knowledge to interpret the squiggly lines on a stethoscope. However, recent developments have enabled this processing at the sensor level. The sensor output can now provide pre-characterized numbers that tell you about the condition of the machine. AE technology has been effectively de-skilled, enabling much wider application use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Suitable for continuously running machinery as well as machinery operating intermittently, slowly or for short durations, AE allows the user to diagnose problems with machinery at an early stage, carry out maintenance procedures and then monitor the improvement. It provides real-time information with early sensitivity to faults and applicability to a wide range of rotational speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As awareness of the unique capabilities of AE increases, so too does the number of applications that it is suited to, many of which have proven difficult for other forms of condition monitoring to address. For example, the analysis of signals, whether from AE sensors or accelerometers, requires a sufficiently long period of machine running at constant speed so that a statistically meaningful signal characterization can be made. But that is where the similarity stops. AE can be effective after around 10 seconds of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the algorithm used to derive the widely used acoustic emission parameters of Distress and dB Level in the MHC range of products from Kittiwake Holroyd requires a 10-second period of running at an approximately constant speed. This compares favorably to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based vibration analysis, which typically needs 60 to 120 seconds of measurement time and tight tolerances on machine speed for an effective signal interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In cases where a hand-held instrument is used for periodic CM, it may be possible to interrupt normal machine operation and put it into a special continuously running mode for the duration of CM measurements. However, such disruption is not always possible and never convenient. Furthermore, it is not compatible with the current trend toward CM automation, which requires continuous online monitoring with permanently installed sensors inputting CM data or status into supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems or programmable logic controllers (PLCs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why are many CM practitioners being so resistant to the benefits that AE brings to the table? It may be because many people have invested a lifetime in vibration and are understandably wary of losing power and status. After all, if you &amp;ldquo;dumb down&amp;rdquo; vibration, surely this reduces the perceived value that they bring to the organization. Actually, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Just because AE is disruptive as a technology, it in no way invalidates traditional vibration techniques but simply extends the impact way beyond what has been able to be achieved to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For vibration techniques to be effective, you need equipment that&amp;rsquo;s far from cheap coupled with clever people to get the best from it. Every result must be analyzed to understand what&amp;rsquo;s good and what&amp;rsquo;s bad. For those who cannot afford the luxury of in-house vibration experts, there are many vibration specialists who offer a contract monitoring service, which is not an insignificant investment. While for some, the criticality of certain applications coupled with the scale of some companies might justify this cost, others could still benefit from the efficiencies realized by similar CM techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, the &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t buy into one-month wonders/we&amp;rsquo;ve all been bitten by the latest whizz-bang technology&amp;rdquo; argument no longer rings true. Indeed, AE techniques are only deemed disruptive because they are now mature with a proven track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultimately, maintenance personnel are responsible for keeping machinery running. If they are empowered to monitor condition themselves, identify where action is needed and then check that the action taken has solved the problem, then AE has significant advantages of cost, speed, flexibility and ease of field application in comparison to traditional vibration analysis techniques. It is the efficient and effective approach to CM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To nurture the technology of a new era, a broader, longer-term view is required. Surely it makes sense to embrace CM techniques that provide for the greatest protection or longest period of warning for potential damage and eventual failure. By &amp;ldquo;de-skilling&amp;rdquo; technology, all maintenance professionals are empowered to make informed decisions quickly and with confidence, ultimately enabling them to positively and significantly impact a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. Of course, there is room for sentiment in business but not at the expense of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/jwbgDwroNgY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Orbits for Condition Monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Orbits have historically been used to measure relative shaft movement within a journal-type bearing.&amp;nbsp;The shape of the orbit told the analyst how the shaft was behaving within the bearing as well as the probable cause of the movement. This was accomplished using proximity probes usually mounted through the bearings with a 90-degree separation and a tip clearance set to around 0.050 inches. With today&amp;rsquo;s modern analyzers, it is possible to also collect an orbit using case-mounted velocity probes or accelerometers to see how the machine housing is moving. Another way of putting it would be the orbit represents the absolute path in space that the machine housing moves through (see Figure 1).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/1/1d1870dc-72ac-495f-8d50-4b29bfc6e141_figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/1/a881d179-0d15-44cc-a058-b718eb2f25c8_figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 450px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is accomplished utilizing a two-channel instrument and collecting an orbit with the sensor of choice being a velocity probe or accelerometer. This is what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as a poor man&amp;rsquo;s operating deflection shape or ODS (see Figure 2).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The analyst can interpret the data to determine machine movement at a particular measurement location or a section of the machine if a tachometer trigger is used during orbit collection as a phase reference. Analysts must keep in mind the exact location of each sensor so that when they look at the shape of the orbit it is possible to tell the movement in relationship to the sensor&amp;rsquo;s location. The sensors should be placed 90 degrees apart or at least as close as possible to 90 degrees. Keep in mind that a properly wired sensor shows motion toward the sensor as a positive signal and motion away from the sensor as a negative signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An orbit is usually collected while the machine is at its normal operating state or speed, but it can also be collected while the machine is increasing or decreasing in speed, such as during a coast-down or startup. The data can be collected in a steady state, in what is known as an unfiltered orbit, requiring no tachometer (see Figures 3 and 3A), or at multiples of running speeds such as first, second or third order to look for issues relating to that or another specific frequency (see Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Ultrasound World VIII to be Held in Florida</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ultrasound World, a forum for ultrasound technology, has been scheduled for May 14-17, 2012, at the Clearwater Hilton in Clearwater Beach, Fla. Entering its eighth year, Ultrasound World has grown into one of the top conferences for reliability and energy conservation. This year&amp;rsquo;s program will feature presentations and short courses by users of ultrasound technology and will cover a wide range of topics for condition monitoring and energy conservation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the presentations offered include &amp;ldquo;No More Equipment Failures! Can You Say That?&amp;rdquo; by Todd Fraser of Procter and Gamble, who will describe how his department dramatically reduced bearing failure incidents using ultrasound technology. The short course &amp;ldquo;Clean, Green and Reliable&amp;rdquo; will explain how equipment reliability delivers low-cost, energy-efficient assets at plants around the world. Other important topics, such as effective energy conservation practices and detecting and analyzing electrical fault conditions with ultrasound, will also be covered in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This conference continues to provide outstanding presentations full of useful content attendees can take away and use in their facilities,&amp;quot; says Doug Waetjen of UE Systems. &amp;quot;We strive to create an outstanding learning environment where attendees can network and share their experiences. The fact that the conference has grown over the past eight years and continues to bring visitors from around the globe, many of whom keep returning, is a testament to the quality of the program.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Answering Common Maintenance Planning Questions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At a recent conference, a number of questions came up that were never properly answered, so I thought I would try to address some of these. The questions involved getting maintenance planners to focus on planning, getting them focused on future work and allowing time to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at roles. The planner should be strategic and focused on future work (i.e., next week and beyond). The supervisor, team leader or lead person should be tactical or focused on today and this week. If parts are needed this week, it&amp;rsquo;s not the planner but the supervisor who should be dealing with it. The same goes for emergencies; we can&amp;rsquo;t plan and schedule them, so they should not normally involve planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning group should be a separate group. The planners should have craft skills; often, they are some of your best craftspeople. However, if you have your planners attending the production meeting where the last 24 hours are reviewed, shame on you. How can the planner focus on the future when you have them focused on today? Watch what happens in the meeting. The day&amp;rsquo;s priorities change before they leave the meeting. Don&amp;rsquo;t put your planners there. Instead, use the supervisors who are dealing with today anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about having supervisors do some planning? Supervisors have to deal with the reactive chaos of today and this week, so the first thing thrown out the window is planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may even look at where your planners are located. If they are in the hub of activity, centered in the shop areas, the interruptions will keep them from planning and scheduling. You want them accessible, but you also want them to have the time to be able to focus on planning. You may have to find another location to get them away from interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need to have good work-management processes so that your planners don&amp;rsquo;t end up simply shagging parts all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What about your partnership with the storeroom/materials management? It takes a while to locate all the parts needed if you have not built your bill of materials in a CMMS/EAM. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good priority matrix and aren&amp;rsquo;t holding people accountable to it, this creates more time loss for the planners in responding to the wrong priority work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a manager, you have to take the steps to encourage the planners to focus on the future. In addition, you need to reward the right behaviors. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to reward people for jumping into the fire every day and resolving the issues at hand. These activities tend to be fast-paced, and they can be seen as the solution provider, the go-to person. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you recognize these activities as chaotic and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/7z8MSvYAcWs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Defining the Role of a Maintenance Planner</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations should have a clear work description of what a planner&amp;rsquo;s role is. The role may vary between organizations, mainly due to plant size. Some organizations have combined planners/supervisors. Some have dedicated planners for shutdowns/turnarounds. Many have people with a planner&amp;rsquo;s title but no planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So how do we figure out a planner&amp;rsquo;s role? The first step is to decide if you (as a plant) want to have planning. In my opinion, it would be a huge mistake to decide against planning, but if you do, you might as well get rid of planners and/or the role of planning. Most of us will decide we should have planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We can&amp;rsquo;t figure out a clear role unless we first have a clear, agreed-upon workflow that describes in which order we are going to pass on information, to whom and who is responsible. Therefore, the first step is to design clear, agreed-upon workflows (business processes) for our daily work, shutdown work, etc. Once we have the workflows, we can start describing the role of planners (and others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be aware when you start describing the role that it is easy to describe all the things a planner should do in a lengthy document. I have seen role descriptions for planners that instruct the planner to do absolutely everything that no one else has time or wants to do. If you have an all-inclusive role description for planners in your plant, perhaps you need to think again. We are often afraid of having a description that allows a planner to say, &amp;ldquo;That is not my job.&amp;rdquo; However, I want to argue that it is critical that a planner says &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to certain assignments. This is because your planners should primarily be planning. If you divert them in emergency work, special projects, supervision, etc., they will be doing those things and not planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we at IDCON describe the planner&amp;rsquo;s role, we often start in the opposite end. We describe what a planner should not do, then describe what a planner should work on. We see the no-no list being used more than the actual work description in day-to-day work. What follows is a typical no-no list for a planner&amp;rsquo;s role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A planner should not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan emergency work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Act as a relief supervisor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Become a material expeditor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work on tools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform time-consuming clerical activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan from behind a desk only&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Become a &amp;ldquo;go-fer&amp;rdquo; for maintenance/operations supervisors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason for the no-no list is that all of the activities will reduce the amount of planned work you have in your facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/IltSrwA3qS8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Achieve Effective Maintenance Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As Sisyphus well knew, pushing things up mountains is difficult, and the uphill struggle from the reactive to the proactive maintenance world is often a frustrating &amp;ldquo;three steps forward, two steps back&amp;rdquo; process. That&amp;rsquo;s a major reason why so many slide back into the familiar, ugly, day-to-day, survival morass at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of those steps on the way up is where preventive maintenance inspections are getting done, we&amp;rsquo;re finding things that need to be fixed and we&amp;rsquo;re fixing them. However, we&amp;rsquo;re still not getting that much better. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fixing the same things over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The famous quote, &amp;ldquo;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it,&amp;rdquo; remains as true as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, the &amp;ldquo;find it, fix it and move on&amp;rdquo; mode is a big step up from the &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look or feel like great improvement, so many get discouraged and tend to look for faster, more rewarding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the maintenance planner can really make a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An item I emphasize in maintenance planning and scheduling classes is the importance of the planner. One of the planner&amp;rsquo;s first activities on the job is to check to see if we&amp;rsquo;ve done this work before on this or similar equipment. If we can get the planning information from previous work (even copy the work order), a huge amount of the planner&amp;rsquo;s time is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement for planner productivity and accuracy, but what&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for maintenance and operational improvement is that now the planner is looking at the number of times the same work has been done before. This tends to raise the questions of why and what can we do about it. That way, we don&amp;rsquo;t just keep making that same repair over and over again. We get folks together and work on it. Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s an operational or equipment care gap that we can fix pretty quickly. Now, we really start to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a case of a motor that kept burning out every six months or so. It was a small motor, and someone different was always making the fix on a different shift. It was a pretty quick replacement, so it took a while to get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sprocket had been replaced on an emergency repair, and since the right one wasn&amp;rsquo;t in stock, the closest one was substituted. No follow-up work order was written to make the right replacement. The motor was overloaded, but not tremendously, so it took a while to die. Of course, it seemed that we were always replacing small motors anyway. Therefore, why would this one stand out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if you search for that work in a CMMS system, the list of occurrences jumps up right away, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious we need to ask why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big issues in plants are usually well-known and as a result have a somewhat reasonable chance of getting attention. But the planner is really the only one looking at all the repairs and is likely to see patterns in the smaller ones. Routinely finding and fixing small items is a key indicator of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, using history requires a few things, the biggest of which is a value for using history. As a society, we&amp;rsquo;d rather jump in and just do it and not &amp;ldquo;waste time&amp;rdquo; researching because &amp;ldquo;this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different.&amp;rdquo; So managers need to encourage planners to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, there&amp;rsquo;s concern that if we don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, we&amp;rsquo;ve wasted that research time. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long. Besides, we&amp;rsquo;re learning what information needs to be there and can fix work orders that aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quality of the information is key. The 60- or 80-character work description is the most significant information seen when a work order listing is pulled up. Therefore, that needs to tell the story clearly. A work request description often states an issue, but the final description should describe the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Something else I recommend is routinely visiting completed work orders to make sure all useful information is captured. Unfortunately, completing paperwork does not have the same value for all personnel, and everyone does not know or understand the use and significance of the various work order fields. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s always useful to actually talk to mechanics to find out how things went and what could have been better in the plan. That&amp;rsquo;s how we get better at planning, too. Effective planning is always a team activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Currently working as a consultant, John Crossan retired after spending 30-plus years with the Clorox Company. His roles for much of the past 14 years were mainly focused on improving operations by fostering the installation and ongoing implementation of basic manufacturing and maintenance procedural mechanisms across 30 varied plants in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to Clorox, John also held operational and engineering roles with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the Burndy Corporation.

            <title>Maintenance Planning and Scheduling for Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/8/d9cac24a-2254-4f7a-87c2-c21621ca39bc_planning-scheduling.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While on a recent flight to Atlanta, I was leafing through a maintenance book when the person across the aisle struck up a conversation. Turns out, he worked as a veteran maintenance supervisor in a large mill where he has worked for the last two years. He spoke about how things were bad from a reactive standpoint and had gotten worse after the mill downsized. As part of the downsizing effort, they had removed some key players and replaced them with some not-so-key players. We talked about how their maintenance planning and scheduling activities were progressing, to which he was disappointed in the progress they had achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that he had two maintenance planners/schedulers with a span of control of about 1:25, yet he was still doing a tremendous amount of planning and scheduling himself. He commented that the span of 1:25 fell within the best practices guidelines. In addition, he mentioned from previous training that he learned that a planner should be able to plan three jobs per day, but the planners were unable to accomplish this amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some additional conversation, we came to understand some of the opportunities present at the mill. I bet you could relate to the rest of the story: Management is dysfunctional. The storeroom is in disarray. The CMMS/EAM system was poorly implemented, and if a part existed in stores, you could not find it in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So let&amp;rsquo;s look as some possible solutions to help this gentleman. There never is but one silver bullet that will fix this stuff, and often it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that a good job plan can start out with three items: the crafts required, the estimated hours needed, and the parts and materials. These three items are an excellent start, provided that you have a process for continuous improvement, also called a feedback loop. When the crafts execute the job, they should write down additional information to improve the plan, such as tools or additional parts required and task steps. When the planner gets this information back, he updates the plan so it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the next use. You might be able to enlist the help of a clerical person (if you are short on planner resources) who does well tippy-tapping on the keyboard. By approaching job plans in this manner, you may find that a planner can successfully plan more than three jobs per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all of that said, you still may find planning to be a bottleneck if you are very reactive and the supporting systems have not been well-implemented. While maintenance planning and scheduling can happen when using a paper system instead of computerized tools, it&amp;rsquo;s still dependent on the supporting structures for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if your purchasing process is a nightmare, that can slow down the efforts. If the storeroom and materials management areas are poorly implemented and in shambles, this can affect the planning and scheduling processes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of other factors that can influence maintenance planning and scheduling success, like the support of maintenance supervision. Now you can see why I tell people that formal maintenance planning and scheduling training is only half of the education required. Formal training should be followed up with coaching and mentoring for the maintenance planners/schedulers. This will help identify and enable the removal of obstacles that impede the planning and scheduling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also may want to consider reducing the span of control for your maintenance planners/schedulers. The recommended span of control for maintenance planning and scheduling is 15 to 30 craftspeople per maintenance planner. Supervision is recommended at eight to 15 crafts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/EfVZsRwp2yE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Dynamic Electric Motor Monitoring to Identify Mechanical Issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic electric motor testing is often called on-line testing because it requires the motor to be running and generally assumes the motor is in its natural environment. Dynamic testing involves the connection of voltage probes and current transformers. Connecting dynamic test equipment is safe, quick and non-intrusive. Data is acquired and results are displayed in a summary format. The collected data is compared to the user-entered nameplate information and is presented in a pass/fail format with both current test data and trending logs displayed after each successive test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Motor Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every reliability technician knows that costs associated with motor failures can be devastating to any business operation. Finding that a motor is operating with conditions that create excessive heat or stress is a guide to the technician to make changes in the motor&amp;rsquo;s operation and to monitor its insulation. Knowing that a motor is in imminent danger of failing provides the technician with time to schedule repairs at his convenience rather than having the motor dictate to him due to a catastrophic failure. Reducing unscheduled downtime while increasing efficiency and profitability are common goals of all reliability technicians. Dynamic motor testing and monitoring is a relatively new concept aiding and advancing the capabilities of those responsible for the safe and continuous operation of electric motors and related equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What Dynamic Testing Tells You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor is one part of a complete system that includes incoming power quality, the motor and the driven load. Many motor problems are created by poor incoming power quality, and many more problems can be attributed to the load and load-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	State-of-the-art dynamic motor test equipment is capable of separating electrical issues from mechanical issues as well as defining power-related problem areas. Good test equipment will provide an enormous amount of information regarding the incoming power, including voltage levels, imbalances and harmonic content. A small amount of voltage imbalance will result in a much larger amount of current imbalance and increase losses within the motor. Harmonic distortion also results in wasted energy causing overheating due mainly to non-sinusoidal sine waves. These issues directly affect a motor&amp;rsquo;s performance and its ability to handle its load. Overall, poor power quality manifests itself as higher heat within the stator and rotor, reducing efficiency and eventually resulting in premature motor failures. Monitoring power quality and making necessary adjustments are essential in maintaining motor longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides power condition, dynamic testing provides extensive information about the motor&amp;rsquo;s behavior and offers evidence of potential mechanical problem areas. The test equipment tracks current levels and unbalances, load levels and torque-related information. Combining this data with the power quality information, the equipment can predict de-rating factors that indicate potential problem areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque and torque ripple add another piece of the puzzle that is required for consistent and accurate diagnosis of the motor&amp;rsquo;s health. Torque ripple is defined as the division of maximal torque divided by average torque during the acquisition period. The torque ripple itself is a measure of how small the torque band is that surrounds a steady state average torque. Torque ripple is independent of power condition and current level. It provides a visual look at how the driven load is performing and is an indicator of rotor stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing can identify rotor bar problems with a high degree of accuracy, and trending logs make tracking them over time easy and predictable. Rotor bar and cage defects result in lost efficiency and higher heat culminating in premature motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring and tracking efficiency is a very difficult task. The operating efficiency of a motor cannot be easily measured in a field application. Many standards have a number of requirements that commonly can only be fulfilled in a laboratory environment. These standards also usually concentrate on ensuring a proper description of a motor&amp;#39;s capabilities under good operating voltage conditions.&amp;nbsp;In the field, however, there is little room for requirements like uncoupling a motor or regulating the voltage level for a saturation run. Questions regarding a particular motor&amp;#39;s capabilities are found to be secondary in importance when compared to the operating efficiency under the given conditions in the field. The result of such an environment is that true efficiencies are unrealistic to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating efficiencies, however, are of crucial importance to an energy-conscious management. The requirements for a true measurement of operating efficiency in a field environment are ample and unrealistic (like installing torque transducers on the shaft of the motor and measuring the input power to the motor at the motor terminals, frequently at high voltage levels). Instead of true efficiency measurement, efficiency estimation becomes the only field-friendly approach for energy management.&amp;nbsp;The difference between operating efficiency measurement and operating efficiency estimation is that the former attempts to find the true operating efficiency via direct measurement, while the latter accepts a small measure of inaccuracy for severely increased user friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a controlled laboratory experiment, vibration analysis and dynamic data were acquired on a new 5-horsepower, 460-volt motor. The motor was disassembled, and the outer race of the drive-end bearing was intentionally damaged (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/85b88efa-0fda-4eda-bb53-3abb5bb64f99_Thomas Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 2px; width: 646px; height: 581px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor was reassembled, and new data collected. The common formula used in vibration analysis was applied to the data acquired, and the results were posted on both the vibration spectra and the torque spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resulting calculations concluded that the outer race defect should appear at 107 hz with sidebands related to the motor speed in the vibration spectra and twice the fundamental frequency in the torque spectra (Figures 2 and 3). The outer race defect with its sidebands was much easier to determine in the dynamically acquired data than the vibration spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 2. Vibration spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 3. Demodulated torque spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rotor Bar Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another laboratory-controlled study, a 1-horsepower motor running under full load on a small dynamometer was tested thoroughly with the dynamic tester. The results were then saved and analyzed. The rotor was removed, and a 5/8-inch hole was drilled through one rotor bar, severing it completely. The motor was assembled and retested under identical conditions. Again, the results were saved and then compared to the original data (Figures 4 and 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The broken rotor bar was clearly defined in the current signature analysis without any difficulty or intensive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cavitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a large electric power plant in North Carolina, mechanics noticed that one of three 15,000-horsepower pumps developed a lower flow level than the other two. The mechanics blamed the motor, while the electricians maintained the pump was at fault. Dynamic electric data was acquired and analyzed. Figure 6 shows the resultant torque ripples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/eb3b70c5-41ad-4096-85e6-85945db08a61_Thomas Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One pump displayed the large variations in the torque ripple, while the two pumps that were operating normally had the smaller torque signature. As a result of this testing, a diver was sent into the pit and found that the bolts on one end-bell had rusted off, allowing the flute that directed water into the pump to fall off. This situation caused the pump to circulate water outside the pump and created cavitation. Bolts on the other pumps were also in need of replacement and would have failed in the near future. The downtime required to make the repairs cost the facility several million dollars, but the increased productivity after the repairs easily compensated for those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, dynamic motor testing and the state-of-the-art equipment available today are rapidly becoming the tools of choice for reliability technicians worldwide. The technology is quite young, and new innovations are continuously expanding its capabilities and horizons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/n5rb3KB_7vY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Discipline and Diligence Are Key for Root Cause Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so now you have put up these fancy (or so you think fancy) check sheets and charts for standard work, expecting the improvements to happen. Things go well for the first couple of days or weeks &amp;ndash; if you are lucky. Everyone is abuzz with this focus of action, but then it begins to degrade. What is happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diligence and discipline of execution are important underlying details of root cause analysis. The new methods are oftentimes person dependent rather than process dependent. So, we find that the owner maintaining this new system goes on vacation, and the team finds itself quickly back where they started &amp;ndash; frustrated and not knowing where to head next. These new methods fall to the side and are sometimes even removed in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The important aspect of this improvement process is applying consistent performance through discipline. The team members must be able to apply the techniques in order to achieve the performance levels and results expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many of you have ever heard the team mention that we start these new things, expect their input for solving the issues and then there is no follow-through? I am sure I am not alone, or at least hope I am not. If so, then we have not done our due diligence in really creating the importance of our improvement activities and have not committed to training our folks on the discipline of what is expected and holding the team to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all have a responsibility to uphold our commitment of training our personnel on what is expected (when we are there or away). It is this key element that will secure the buy-in needed to really drive our improvement process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/ILy_PlGJ36A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New Testing Methods Can Benefit Mechanical Systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Experimental modal analysis (EMA) and operating deflection shape (ODS) analysis are new techniques used to animate the dynamic response of mechanical systems. An EMA provides mode shapes associated with natural frequencies of a mechanical system. An ODS offers an animation of the deformation characteristics of a vibrating mechanical system during operation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The animations can be extremely helpful in defining areas of structural weakness or identifying areas of mechanical &amp;ldquo;looseness.&amp;rdquo; In cases of resonant excitation, the animation techniques can be used to evaluate the potential benefit of structural and/or mechanical modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Experimental Modal Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Excitation of a natural frequency, referred to as resonance, is one of the most common reasons for excessive vibration of machines and supporting structures and foundations. In some cases, the source of the dynamic force that excites the resonance can be identified and removed. However, in most cases, the solution to the resonance problem requires design modifications directed at changing the natural frequencies. A complete understanding of the modal parameters of the mechanical system is imperative to any study involving the development of a structural or mechanical modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many experimental procedures available for identifying the modal parameters of a mechanical system. Modal parameters are dynamic characteristics of a system and include the natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping for each mode of natural frequency. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is a test and analysis procedure that provides estimates for all of the modal parameters of a mechanical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An understanding of the mode shape is necessary for the evaluation of structural and/or mechanical modifications proposed for a vibrating mechanical system. The mode shape will provide information relative to locations within the mechanical system that are too flexible. This information can be used for the optimization of the design of any modification made for the purpose of altering the modal characteristics of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An EMA requires impact response data for many locations and directions, referred to as degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom of the test must be sufficient to accurately define all of the mode shapes. The relative magnitude and phase information at all of the degrees of freedom are plotted to provide an animation of the mode shape at every natural frequency. EMA software is commercially available to facilitate the curve fitting and animation of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experimental modal analysis can be performed using either one of two impact test methods: fixed excitation or fixed response. In the fixed excitation test, the impact location and direction remains stationary for the entire test. The response transducer is moved to obtain data at all of the degree of freedom locations. This is referred to as roving with the response transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed response test method requires that a response transducer remains stationary at a single data location while the impact hammer is moved to excite the mechanical system at each and every degree of freedom. This is referred to as roving with the impact hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The principle of Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s reciprocity states that the results obtained using either of the test methods will be identical if the mechanical system is perfectly linear elastic.&amp;nbsp; However, very few real industrial mechanical systems are perfectly linear elastic. Non-linearities introduced by bolted connections, fluid films, load related support stiffness, etc., will affect the results of the modal test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed excitation method is recommended to minimize the effect of structural and mechanical non-linearities. The participation of a non-linearity in any mode shape will be nearly constant if the force used to excite the mechanical system is applied in the same place during the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fixed response method is typically used to test mechanical systems that are constructed of non-magnetic materials, thus requiring the response transducer to be attached using epoxy cement or other adhesive. The time required to complete a modal test of a complex mechanical system can be prohibitive if the fixed excitation method is used and a response transducer is cemented to the mechanical system at each data location. For non-magnetic structures, the fixed response method is much faster, requiring a single transducer to be cemented to the mechanical system as a reference point. Data is then obtained by simply exciting the system at each and every degree of freedom with the impact hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Experimental Modal Analysis Case History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Catastrophic fatigue failures of industrial fan wheels have been attributed to the excitation of natural frequencies (resonance) during operation. The most common causes for this type of failure are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Excitation of the principal nodal line (wobble) mode of the rotor by dynamic forces produced at either one or two times the rotation speed of the fan. Dynamic forces are normally developed at one times the rotational speed of the fan due to imbalance. However, dynamic forces can also be developed at one or two times by misalignment, disk skew, looseness between fan wheel and shaft, structural asymmetry, bent shaft, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Excitation of the principal nodal circle (umbrella)or two nodal diameter (chip) modes of the fan wheel by pressure pulsations produced at the blade pass frequency or by aerodynamic (rotating stall) or acoustic sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An impact test can be performed to determine the natural frequencies of a fan rotor. A picture of a typical shop test arrangement for the modal analysis of a single wide fan is shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/9d5ab98d-b882-4a8f-b13c-142d18936594_Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 479px; height: 348px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 1. Single Wide Fan Rotor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experimental modal test of the fan rotor was performed to identify the natural frequencies and mode shapes thereof. The results of the modal test were then compared to the frequencies associated with dynamic forces produced during operation to evaluate the probability of resonant excitation. The fan wheel was designed to operate at 1,180 rpm (19.67 Hz). Since the fan wheel contained 12 blades, it would produce a dynamic blade pass pressure pulsation at 236 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/203d2ada-7e46-49db-80c8-a1855263461f_Figure 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 440px; height: 457px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. Impact Test Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 contains the results of an impact test performed to identify the natural frequencies of the rotor. The upper plot shows the &amp;ldquo;ring-down&amp;rdquo; response. A trigger delay was used such that some of the data prior to the application of the impact force was retained in the FFT Analyzer. The amount of background noise can be visualized in addition to the approximate &amp;ldquo;ring down&amp;rdquo; signal/background noise ratio. The &amp;ldquo;ring down&amp;rdquo; characteristic of this waveform is a clear indication of a valid impact test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lower plot is the transfer function. The transfer function is obtained by dividing the frequency spectrum of the response data by the frequency spectrum of the impact force. It is an indicator of sensitivity since it is in units of the amount of motion per pound of force. Peaks in the transfer function curve are indicative of a natural frequency. Natural frequencies are evident at 42.5 Hz, 73 Hz, 107.5 Hz, 140 Hz, 175 Hz, and 236.5 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/1461d16a-4159-4635-991c-eb9e9bfc64a7_Figure 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 448px; height: 481px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Figure 3. Mode shape at 42.5 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A complete experimental modal test was performed to determine the mode shape for each natural frequency. A side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 42.5 Hz is included in Figure 3. This mode shape is commonly referred to as the principal &amp;ldquo;wobble&amp;rdquo; mode. It is also referred to as a single nodal line mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips form a nearly straight single line, having one maximum positive and one maximum negative nodal location. This mode was not considered a problem since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either the blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 contains the mode shape for the natural frequency at 73 Hz. This mode shape is commonly referred to as the &amp;ldquo;umbrella&amp;rdquo; mode.&amp;nbsp; It is also referred to as the principal nodal circle mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips form a nearly straight single line and all move in phase axially together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This mode can be very sensitive to dynamic pressures since the entire surface of the back plate of the fan wheel moves in phase. However, it was not considered a problem for the subject fan since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 140 Hz is included in Figure 5. This mode shape is the two nodal diameter mode, sometimes referred to as the &amp;ldquo;butterfly&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;chip&amp;rdquo; mode. The line of data points associated with the blade tips (trailing edges) form a curved surface with two maximum positive and two maximum negative axial nodal deformations. Once again, this mode was not considered a problem since the natural frequency was much greater than both one and two times the rotational speed of the fan and was much less than the frequency of either the blade pass or acoustic pulsations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/09a0f591-89f7-44a1-9a11-a6951af877c1_Figure 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 442px; height: 476px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Mode shape at 73 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/d9db798d-edee-4d64-a5fb-47aa2ea47ab0_Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 438px; height: 486px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 5. Mode shape at 140 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The experimental modal study indicated that the natural frequencies associated with the major modes of concern were all separated from the frequencies of dynamic forces produced by the fan and should not be a problem. However, the impact test identified a natural frequency at around 236.5 Hz, which almost coincided with the blade pass pressure pulsation frequency. The mode shape for this natural frequency was developed to investigate the potential for excitation thereof by the dynamic pressure pulsations that would be developed by the fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/ec6247b6-3af7-466d-b9ce-5b71fbebe6fe_Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 439px; height: 474px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 6. Mode shape at 236.5 Hz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 6 contains a side view of the mode shape for the natural frequency at 236.5 Hz. This mode shape is referred to as a four nodal diameter mode. The axial deformation of the fan forms a curved surface with four maximum positive and four maximum negative axial nodal deformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The natural frequencies identified by the impact tests were for a stationary wheel. The actual operating natural frequencies will be affected by centrifugal stress stiffening and gyroscopic effects. Although centrifugal stress stiffening generally has less of an effect on the higher energy mode shapes, such as the four nodal diameter mode, it would only have to be increased by a small amount to fall outside of the magnification range of the natural frequency. The amplification range of this natural frequency is limited due to the extremely low amount of damping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The experimental modal study discovered a higher energy mode with a potential for excitation. Although this mode would not be as sensitive to dynamic pressure pulsations as the previous two modes, if excited, it could still adversely affect the fatigue life of the fan wheel and the reliability of the air-handling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the results of the experimental modal test, this fan wheel was strain gauged to evaluate the dynamic stresses during operation and confirm that the stress stiffened value for the natural frequency was not a problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	ODS Test Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The test procedure for an operating deflection shape analysis consists of acquiring information regarding the displacement and phase of a mechanical system at any discrete frequency. An ODS test is performed while the equipment is in operation using either single- or multi-channel instrumentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step in either a single-channel or multi-channel operating deflection shape test is to develop the ODS model that will be used to animate the data. The number and location of data points used in the model must be sufficient to describe the deformation characteristics of the mechanical system. An inadequate number of data point locations could result in visual aliasing that could lead to a misleading ODS animation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amount of data required to provide an accurate ODS animation is dependent upon the vibrating mechanical system to be analyzed. An understanding of the structural dynamics of the system is necessary to develop an optimum ODS test procedure. Knowledge gained from preliminary vibration test results can be used to optimize the test procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Novice analysts should obtain as much data as possible. The acquisition of too much data will not hurt the operating deflection shape animation. Also, since the ODS test is performed while the equipment is operating, the extra time required to obtain additional information beyond what is optimally required should not affect the productivity of the equipment, although the same cannot be said for the productivity of the analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data acquisition technique used in a single-channel analysis differs from a multi-channel analysis. In either method, attention to bookkeeping is extremely important to ensure an accurate animation of the vibration data. Each data point must be stored with proper identification, including identification number, direction and sign (+/-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Single-Channel ODS Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a single-channel test, the operating deflection shape animation is based upon the absolute amount of response obtained for each vibration measurement. Phase information is obtained from a tach signal, usually placed on a shaft that rotates at the frequency at which the animation is desired. Response data is obtained by roving with a transducer among all of the data points in the mechanical system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration data should be acquired in all three orthogonal directions for each data point location. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom in the ODS animation will be three times the number of data points identified in the model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration and phase must be obtained for each degree of freedom. This information can then be manually entered into a commercially available modal/ODS computer program to obtain the animation of the deflected shape of the mechanical equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Multi-Channel ODS Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The animation of multi-channel ODS test data is based upon a curve fit of the magnitude of vibration at multiple locations throughout a mechanical system relative to the magnitude of vibration at a single reference location. The phase information required for the animation is obtained from the cross-channel function of the reference and response transducers. A tach signal is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/5/96d15167-dd0c-4cd7-876d-edb5ca12d317_Figure 7.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 474px; height: 319px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 7. Multi-channel ODS Test Setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 7 shows a typical multi-channel ODS test setup. The reference transducer should be placed at a location that contains a significant response at every frequency at which an ODS animation is desired. It remains stationary during the entire test. Response data is obtained by roving with a transducer among all of the data points in the mechanical system, collecting data in all three orthogonal directions for each data point identified in the ODS model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The frequency response function (FRF) for each data point contains the phase and relative magnitude of vibration between the reference and response transducers. Many multi-channel analyzers have the capability of automatically transferring the FRFs to commercially available ODS software, eliminating the need to manually input data. The ODS software is then used to provide an animation of the deflected shape of the mechanical system at any discrete frequency within the frequency range of data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One advantage of multi-channel testing is that the variation in vibration that might occur during an ODS test will not affect the accuracy of the animation because a multi-channel ODS is based upon the relative magnitude of vibration between the response and reference transducer. For linear mechanical systems, the vibration at the response transducer will increase or decrease in direct proportion with the reference transducer. This is important for lengthy tests of large mechanical systems. Data can be appended to a multi-channel ODS animation months or years later if the structural dynamic characteristics of the mechanical system are not changed. Since a single-channel ODS animation is based upon the absolute magnitude of vibration at the time of acquisition, variations in vibration will adversely affect the accuracy of the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, a single-channel operating deflection shape is limited to the animation of the response of the mechanical system at the rotational frequency of the shaft at which the reference signal is obtained. Multi-channel ODS animations can be developed at any frequency within the defined frequency range of the analyzer. This is important in cases where vibration does not occur at either shaft speed or a harmonic multiple (such as aerodynamic and flow-induced vibration, response to broadband excitation, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	ODS vs. Modal Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating deflection shape analysis is often used to either supplement or sometimes replace a modal analysis. If a mechanical system produces a dynamic force at or near a natural frequency, the resultant operating deflection shape will approximate the mode shape for that particular natural frequency. Since an ODS test is performed while equipment is operating, it can be used to define the structural dynamic characteristics of a resonant condition without interrupting production. A modal test requires that the equipment not be operating, which in some industrial processes can be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An operating deflection shape analysis cannot identify natural frequencies that are not excited during operation of the mechanical system. Therefore, the ODS test does guarantee that other mode shapes do not exist. Impact testing is recommended to identify all natural frequencies within the frequency range of concern before modifying any mechanical system based upon the results of an ODS animation. A complete experimental modal analysis (EMA) is recommended for cases where several natural frequencies are identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/lLefJtoFkp4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Keys to Maintain Equipment Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is so much similarity in all that we do within the maintenance planning and scheduling world that compares to other separate and distinct functions. Let me explain. Borrowing from root cause analysis process methods, I trust you are familiar with Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams). These diagrams are one method that is used for product design, quality defect avoidance or variation, or to identify factors that lead to some event, hence the use in root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The categories typically include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man (people)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements to perform the tasks, including time estimates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: Any equipment, tools, etc., needed to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: Consumables, parts required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: Data generated from the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these items combine together to create some output or event. In the case of maintenance planning and scheduling, hopefully they combine to maintain or restore the reliability of equipment, as an example. See, in all we do, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that every product (i.e., maintaining equipment) is the result of a process. Let&amp;rsquo;s break them down individually for maintenance planning and scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man: People or staffing (which crafts?), skill requirements, number of people, contractors or vendors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: The job-plan task steps and sequence; items such as permits, manuals and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: What special tools (man lift, ladder, etc.) are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: What consumables or parts are needed to restore the equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: What do we need to know to improve the job plan? In the case of a condition-based monitoring task, we can take measurements to find something in the act of failing to allow planned restoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, all of these items roll up to complete the job plan and job package that should be created by the maintenance planner. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete all of these items, which three should I focus on first to ensure that I could drive craft effectiveness? From a maintenance scheduling perspective, I need the manpower requirements, estimated hours and the materials, but it can&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The only way that it&amp;rsquo;s effective is if I have a continuous improvement loop that relies on the feedback of the technicians to improve the job plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/f6HEKIkcHbw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Thermography to Uncover Hidden Problems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Thermography can be used to identify and analyze thermal anomalies for the purposes of condition monitoring of machines. These thermal anomalies are usually caused by such mechanisms as operation, improper lubrication, misalignment, worn components or mechanical loading anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is based on measuring the distribution of radiant thermal energy (heat) emitted from a target surface and converting this to a surface temperature map or thermogram. Thermal energy is present with the operation of all machines. It can be in the form of friction losses within machines, energy losses within machines, as a characteristic of the process media or any combination thereof. As a result, temperature can be a key parameter for monitoring the performance of machines, the condition of machines and the diagnostics of machine problems. Temperature is also one of the key causes and symptoms of lubricant degradation and loss of lubrication function within a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared thermography is an ideal technology to investigate thermal anomalies on machines because it offers complete thermal images of a machine or a machine component with no physical attachments (non-intrusive), requires little setup and provides the results in a very short period of time. As such, thermography techniques can be used as part of a condition monitoring process when such a process is implemented in accordance with ISO 17359.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Thermography Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are several recognized infrared thermography techniques in use throughout industry. Comparative thermography is the most common technique, and it is normally used to provide the best available data in lieu of ideal or absolute thermal measurements. When encountering changing machinery operating conditions, the ability to perform rough emissivity estimates and to differentiate emissivity differences on machinery equipment provides useful information for condition monitoring and diagnostics of the machine under the less-than-ideal circumstances frequently encountered in the field. Absolute thermography is used when it is essential to know as precisely as possible the true temperature of a target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparative thermography can be either quantitative or qualitative. The quantitative technique requires the determination of a temperature value to distinguish the severity of a component&amp;rsquo;s condition. This value is determined by comparing the target&amp;rsquo;s temperature to that of similar service equipment or baseline data. Although the temperature value is not exact, it is reasonably close to actual. More importantly, the temperature differentials are accurate. However, there are many applications where quantitative data is not required to monitor the condition of machinery or to diagnose a problem and recommend the appropriate corrective action. In these cases, qualitative techniques may be more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Quantitative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comparative quantitative thermography method is an effective method for evaluating the condition of a machine or component by comparing approximate temperature values between identical items, reference values or baselines. The determination of precise actual temperatures of a component, using infrared thermography in the field, is considered very difficult to obtain. This is due to a certain extent to the physics of infrared thermography, which must take into consideration the multiple parameters that enable a true absolute temperature measurement. These considerations are emissivity, reflectivity and transmissivity. As a result, estimates of these considerations can be readily made to obtain a component&amp;rsquo;s approximate temperature, which in most cases is more than sufficient to determine the severity of an adverse condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since it is not always practical to determine the exact temperature or even emissivities of each machine component, the alternative use of comparative thermography becomes more practical. Comparative measurement, unlike qualitative measurement, identifies a thermal deficiency by comparing the temperatures obtained using a consistent emissivity value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The temperature differential between two or more identical or similar components is measured numerically. Assuming that the environmental conditions for both components are similar, the differential temperature for the given piece of equipment is recorded as being the amount above the normal operating temperature of the similar equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of comparative quantitative thermography would be that, if two or more machines are operating in the same environment and under the same load conditions, and one is experiencing an elevated temperature, this is usually an indication that a deteriorating condition may exist. However, the determination of the temperature difference would then assist in establishing the severity of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, a 5-degree C differential would be considered minor, whereas a 100-degree C differential may be considered to be critical. Also, knowing the approximate value of the elevated temperature would provide an indication that the temperature limit of a component may be approaching alarm values. Therefore, while qualitative measurements can also detect deficiencies, it is the quantitative measurements that have the capability of determining severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comparative Qualitative Thermography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparative qualitative measurement compares the infrared pattern, such as gear contact patterns, of one component to that of an identical or similar component under the same or similar operating conditions. When searching for differing thermal patterns, an anomaly is identified by the intensity variations between any two or more similar objects, without assigning temperature values to the patterns. This technique is quick and easy to apply, and it does not require any adjustments to the infrared instrument to compensate for atmospheric or environmental conditions, or surface emissivities. Although the result of this type of measurement can identify a deficiency, it does not provide a level of severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This infrared thermography technique is used throughout most industries. It is very effective in identifying hot bearings or other abnormally hot machine components, hot spots in electrical equipment, undesirable hot electrical connections, leaking or even clogged fluid heat-exchange equipment and its components (tubes), and fluid leaks from pressure vessels, pipes and valves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Thermometry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The determination of the absolute temperature of a target using infrared thermography is very difficult to obtain because of the many technical and environmental factors involved. As a result, absolute infrared thermography measurements are done only if very precise temperature values or small temperature differentials are critical to a process. These determinations are normally attempted only under extremely controlled laboratory type conditions. This type of measurement is not normally used for condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Baseline Measurements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is strongly recommended that baseline measurements be taken of critical plant equipment. This is very important when making later infrared thermography surveys of machines or components and comparing them with previous thermograms of the same machines operating under the same load and environmental conditions. This condition monitoring procedure is useful for early identification of developing problems, thus preventing major maintenance operations or catastrophic failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assessment Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When applying infrared thermography to condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines and their related components, it is recommended that severity criteria be established. Severity criteria can take two forms: they can be organized into general categories that identify temperature levels or zones (versus levels of criticality), and they can be applied to specific machines or components, or to like groups of machines or components. In either case, the levels are established through experience and the accumulation of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In practice, no singular acceptance criteria is universally applicable to the variety of items and applications existing in industry. Consequently, severity criteria must be developed for each category of equipment based upon its design, manufacture, operation, installation, maintenance characteristics, failure modes and criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Severity criteria can be established on individual machines or components. This method is based on many factors, including temperature rise vs. historical data that establishes rate of deterioration and time to failure, criticality of the machine or component to the overall process, location with respect to other materials/equipment should a fire result, safety of personnel, environmental conditions, etc. Applications could include temperature rises of critical machines, mechanical components, bearing temperature rises, electrical supply or connection rises, fluid leakage losses or even the number of tubes clogged in fluid heat-transfer-type equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The infrared thermographer may use temperature difference criteria or classify the temperature severity of mechanical system anomalies. These criteria are usually reported as the temperature rise of the exception above the temperature of a defined reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By taking multiple measurements over time of similar components under similar operating and environmental conditions, statistical analysis can be used to set operational limits for trending and predicting the temperature performance of these components. This type of system may be used in conjunction with these absolute temperature criteria to rate the temperature severity of an exception above the maximum allowable temperature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Relative Temperature Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of a set of severity criteria based on categories and temperature rises above established references is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ADVISORY&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Up to a 10-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;INTERMEDIATE&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10-degree C to 20-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SERIOUS&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20-degree C to 40-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; CRITICAL&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In excess of a 40-degree C rise above a reference or baseline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reference temperatures should be based on temperatures specified by manufacturers of similar items or groups of equipment, or of components located on the same shaft. Baseline temperatures should be based on historical or statistically derived temperatures established from the specific item or machine groups when in the &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Absolute Temperature Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The infrared thermographer may use absolute maximum allowable temperature criteria based on published data to identify mechanical system anomalies. There are two categories of criteria: material and design. Material criteria are used where the integrity of the material itself is of concern and is the focus of monitoring. Design criteria are used where the design integrity is the major concern and is the focus of the monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Design criteria should always be used in preference to material criteria, since design criteria normally incorporate material requirements. Design criteria are usually cognizant of performance, operation, reliability and capacity criteria rather than just component material integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When heating several adjacent system components and a material criteria is used, the component material having the lowest temperature specification should be referenced as the alarm criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most machine cases, the lubricant will have the lowest temperature specification. The maximum allowable temperature should be stated as the temperature above which an unacceptable loss of component life will be experienced due to a loss of lubricant characteristics. Such reductions in characteristics may be immediate (viscosity) or long-term (additive depletion). Such criteria will tend to be design rather than material based. This will require application-specific temperature criteria despite the possible use of common lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many instances the infrared thermographer cannot directly measure the surfaces of actual components. Care and good judgment must be used when applying any severity specifications to actual field temperature measurements, taking into account conduction paths, convection and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Profile Assessment Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Profile assessment is a process of comparing temperature differences and patterns across a surface. As in any severity-assessment process, the absolute and differential temperatures and profiles need to be determined for two key conditions: &amp;ldquo;as new&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;failed.&amp;rdquo; Severity assessment is the subsequent process of determining the condition of the equipment between these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key areas of profile assessment are temperature gradients, changes in profile, historical changes, localized differences, absolute temperatures, location of anomalies or profile characteristics relative to the item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Survey Intervals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey intervals should be determined with knowledge of the rate of deterioration of the expected fault and the behavior over time of temperature as a representative symptom of the fault. The determination of the survey interval is primarily necessary for prognosis accuracy rather than fault identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Image Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a machinery viewpoint, thermal image interpretation essentially is a process of comparing absolute temperature and temperature profiles against design, manufacture, installation, operation and maintenance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using thermography for machinery condition monitoring purposes, the operating conditions at the time of each survey should be known in detail, as many changes in thermal profile are operating-condition dependent. The design of a machine is essential to understanding component loading, which in turn is the primary contributor to thermal profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using thermography to assess machine condition, it is important that the machine is viewed as a whole and that each image is analyzed as part of a series rather than as an individual representation of a localized condition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thermal imaging is a very powerful correlation technique for other condition monitoring methods. It is exceedingly useful for assisting with solving lubrication issues that are temperature-related, as it can pinpoint location, source and extent of the influencing thermal anomalies, as well as determine the effectiveness of circulation, control and cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowledge of design, manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance-induced failure modes and their thermal symptoms is paramount to successful machinery investigation and solution design using thermal imaging. This knowledge is of far greater importance than specific knowledge of the technique, its applications or its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Study: Mill Drive Train Misalignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A recent case study involved a grinding mill drive train in a gold mine consisting of a motor, a three-shaft reduction gearbox, two pinion bearings and a pinion gear. All bearings were rolling element types with the mill drive pinion gear bearings being double row spherical roller bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The following temperatures were recorded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/28/2935e89f-176a-4985-8849-1ea237525062_Table.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 274px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/28/5ab5aaeb-e8ca-4e71-aa03-3f856e0b4845_Chart.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 263px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Motor&amp;nbsp;Bearing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gearbox&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bearing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mill Drive Pinion Gear&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The temperature of the gearbox intermediate shaft (B) normally was expected to be slightly higher (1 to 2 degrees C) than the high-speed shaft (A) and moderately higher (3 to 5degrees C) than the slow-speed shaft (C), as it was in double mesh at any one time and received more heat input. In this case, the average temperature rise was approximately 8.5degrees C above the low-speed shaft and approximately 3.5degrees C above the high-speed shaft, which was considered above normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The above temperatures and profiles were indicative of a misalignment between the motor and gearbox, a misalignment between the gearbox and the mill drive pinion, and a misalignment between the mill drive pinion gear and driven girth gear. The combined motor to gearbox and gearbox to mill drive pinion misalignments resulted in a loss of end float within the gearbox, trapping the intermediate shaft gear. The 10.3-degree C temperature difference across the mill drive pinion gear was also considered excessive and indicative of severe pinion to girth gear misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The misalignment conditions, gear loading and bearing distress were all confirmed using vibration analysis. Subsequent overhaul and re-alignment of the drive train reduced the temperatures to acceptable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	Case Study: Turbine Oil Coolers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two turbine oil coolers of identical design demonstrated that one of the turbines had an oil cooler problem. Insufficient thermal evidence existed to determine whether the problem was related to oil flow, water flow or both, given that both machines were operating at identical loads. Under identical loads and oil conditions, turbine No. 2 operated with consistently higher vibration due to the effects of reduced oil viscosity resulting from higher operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Implementing Solutions to Root Causes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Root cause analysis and root cause failure analysis are commonly used terms, but I have always felt that they are somewhat misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, there is not really such a thing as a &amp;ldquo;root cause&amp;rdquo; to a problem. If you try to find a definition for &amp;ldquo;root cause,&amp;rdquo; you will discover a mix of homegrown attempts, but all of them are general or unclear in nature. Here is an example: &amp;ldquo;A root cause is an initiating cause of a causal chain which leads to an outcome or effect of interest.&amp;rdquo; Aside from being wrong, it is quite a bunch of incomprehensive verbiage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem with definitions such as these is that in the real world it is never possible to prove a single event that solely initiates a whole chain of other events. That is because there are always other events before the so-called &amp;ldquo;root cause event.&amp;rdquo; This may seem like semantics, but for problem-solvers, it is important to keep in mind that there never is a silver-bullet answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, is the root cause really that important? In my opinion, the process we call root cause failure analysis should be used to implement solutions. That is the whole idea, isn&amp;rsquo;t it &amp;mdash; to find and implement solutions? If we think logically in reverse and ask, &amp;ldquo;Do we always have to know the root causes to find great solutions?&amp;rdquo; The answer is absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a mill has problems with failing bearings in most of its rotating equipment. After a quick look, we find that equipment isn&amp;rsquo;t aligned, there are no lubrication routes set up, no clean oil storage and no sealed storage for spare bearings. Do we need to do a root cause on each bearing and find out the exact root causes of each one? No. Let&amp;rsquo;s not spend time and money on the root cause of hundreds of bearings. Let&amp;rsquo;s work on solutions that we know will improve the problems. Sure, there may be other contributing factors, but the above will be the most pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many people who get excited in root cause become too detail oriented and lose sight of the big picture and the economics of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, in summary, there is no such thing as &amp;ldquo;a root cause,&amp;rdquo; and plant/mill people need to focus more on implementing solutions based on a practical root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IDCON calls our approach root cause problem elimination to shift the focus more toward implementation of solutions based on root cause analysis studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/lsjRTRxsvyg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Identifying Mechanical Faults with Motor Current Signature Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has proven to be a highly valuable predictive maintenance tool. Although it is a relatively young, rarely utilized technology, it is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry today. Mechanical faults related to belts, couplers, alignment and more are easily found through the use of a demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MCSA is simply the process by which motor current readings are recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain. It has been around since 1985 and proven itself well over the years in locating rotor faults and air gap problems in motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor current signature is recorded in a time domain format. The current is represented in a graph form with the amplitude shown on the &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; axis and the time on the &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; axis. The result is a typical current sinewave shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to analyze the data, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed. An FFT is a mathematical operation designed to extract the frequency information from the time domain and transform it into the frequency domain. An example of an FFT spectrum is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the FFT spectrum is a great source for identification of rotor bar problems in motors, it proved difficult to analyze most other frequencies. In order to address this problem, the demodulated current spectrum was developed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/23/eb7d1922-096a-4a94-b83b-1770a99cbe8a_Figure 1-2.jpeg" style="width: 642px; height: 182px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Time Domain Format&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 2. FFT Format&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Demodulated Current Spectrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, one of the most exciting advancements in PdM technologies is the demodulated current spectrum. In order to better understand demodulation, the concept of modulation should briefly be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modulation is when lower frequencies are merged on top of a higher frequency. In other words, lower frequencies ride on the higher frequency signal. This makes the carrier frequency the dominant peak in the FFT spectrum, and most of the information is lost in the noise floor of the spectrum. Although they have always been present in the current spectrum, the repetitive load variation frequencies have been difficult to identify and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demodulation is simply the process of taking the carrier frequency out of the spectrum. In this case, the carrier frequency is the fundamental electrical frequency being used. The fundamental frequency in the United States is 60 Hz. In many other countries, it is 50 Hz. After removing the carrier frequency, the frequencies related to repetitive load variations are left behind and shown on the demodulated current spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frequencies such as speed, pole pass, belt pass, vane pass, gears and bearing frequencies can be identified and trended in the demodulated current spectrum. In effect, the motor is acting like a permanently installed transducer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the technology being relatively new, trending remains the most accurate method of identifying a problem in a machine. The ability to have baseline data when the machine is in good health is ideal, while comparing data to similar machines is also very effective. In the future, as historical and statistical data is compiled, there will be more alarming guidelines established for different types of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Locating Belt Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The basic current signature of a belt-driven machine is shown in Figure 3. It shows the fundamental 60 Hz frequency being the dominant peak. Note the sideband peaks on each side of 60 Hz that are labeled with their frequencies. This type of signature has the potential of being misconstrued as a potential rotor bar problem. In this example, the sidebands are actually related to belt pass frequency. The mechanical frequency in rotations per minute (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) is calculated using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Mechanical frequency = (the change&amp;nbsp;between line frequency and peak of interest) x 60&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mechanical frequency of interest in this case would then be calculated by multiplying 6.5 Hz by 60. The result would be 390 &lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;, which is the belt pass frequency of this machine. Rotor bar problems show up at pole pass frequency, with the peaks much closer to the fundamental frequency. Pole pass frequency is calculated with the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;PolePass= synchronous speed &amp;ndash; (slip frequency / # of poles)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/18/ba32daa5-0094-4505-bf4d-2c84153b6daf_Figure 3 and 4.jpeg" style="width: 601px; height: 246px;" /&gt;Figure 3. Belted machine current spectrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Figure 4. Demodulated spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the mechanical peaks in Figure 3 are prevalent, this is often not the case. Usually, the mechanical peaks will be lost in the noise floor of this type of spectrum. This is where the demodulated signal becomes so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 shows the demodulated spectrum derived from the current signature in Figure 3. Notice how much cleaner and easier to read this example appears. Without the 60 Hz electrical frequency present, the remaining mechanical frequencies become much more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sideband frequencies shown in Figure 3 now show up in Figure 4 at 6.5 Hz along with a 2x and 3x belt pass frequency in the demodulated spectrum. Looking closely at the current spectrum, the 2x and 3x frequencies are present but not as easily identified. Belt pass peaks in this type of spectrum are good early indicators of belt alignment, wear and sheave problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Running Speed Frequencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both drive and driven speeds will also be found in the spectrum if there is a problem. As in vibration, a 1x rotational speed will signify an unbalanced effect on the machine. In Figure 4, the fan speed shows up at just over 25 Hz. In Figure 5, the running speed of an 1,800-&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;RPM&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt; pump motor can be identified at just less than 30 Hz. In both cases, trending the amplitude of these peaks can tell us many things about the condition of the machine. Normally, this peak will be at or near the noise floor of the spectrum. The two most common reasons that the amplitude will climb on direct-drive pump assemblies are due to misalignment or a damaged coupling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amplitude response on the spectrum is remarkably sensitive. A noticeable amplitude increase will occur with the incorrect key length in the hub. The common flexible-type couplings used will also show up when they fatigue, crack or become twisted. An example of a brittle flexible coupling with stress cracking is shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the follow-up test completed after a new coupler and laser alignment was performed. Notice the amplitude of the rotational speed peak at 30 Hz relative to the amplitude of the low-frequency product flow noise in each spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Demodulation Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another common frequency found in a demodulated current spectrum is the pump vane pass and fan blade pass frequency. This will help to trend and locate problems with the impeller or flow restrictions. In a demodulated current spectrum, it is calculated by using the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Vane pass = pole pass frequency x # of vanes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the growth of the technology, knowledge and software advancements, locating bearing faults, gear mesh and other mechanical frequencies with MCSA will also become more common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Incorporating into a PdM program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all that demodulated MCSA can do, there are still many questions as to how it will fit into and benefit a PdM program. Frequently asked questions might include: Why do I care about finding mechanical faults with a demodulated current signal if I can find them with technologies like vibration analysis or infrared thermography? How reliable is the data that is generated and can it take the place of vibration? How often should MCSA be completed on equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With any condition monitoring technology, there are strengths and weaknesses. Each technology applied will give a more complete view of the health of the equipment. For best results, it is recommended to complete MCSA at least quarterly. If a program is testing less frequently than this, the overall results of the motor testing program will be compromised. As with any technology, it is critical to have enough data to accurately trend the history of the machine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for MCSA technology looking for mechanical faults, there are many reasons why this can benefit a PdM program. For example, when it comes to belt and coupler problems, demodulation will give an earlier and often more accurate fault indication than vibration analysis. The amount of energy created by the early stages of this type of fault is relatively low. When belts or couplers begin to wear, it is often not noticed in a vibration spectrum until the fault is nearing catastrophic failure. A demodulated current spectrum has the ability to detect the fault early enough to provide plenty of time to plan and schedule the repairs. However, demodulated MCSA is not intended to take the place of a vibration program. It is best used as a complimentary technology to a good vibration program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An added benefit of this technology would be in remote equipment locations or areas where equipment is not accessible during normal operations. On this type of equipment, visual inspections can be difficult, and the ability to perform vibration analysis is limited. Depending on the risk assessment, remote wiring transducers for vibration may be too costly. In this case, MCSA would work well due to the ability of the equipment to be tested from the motor control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of any strong PdM program is having the ability to verify a fault with more than one technology. This not only ensures the validity of the fault but also helps make a more accurate and precise repair recommendation. The importance of verification with a second technology is never more evident than on a critical piece of equipment that requires plant outages for repair. Demodulated MCSA brings an added dimension to this effort and has proven itself to be an invaluable tool for any PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/frEwzOdb6YM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Common Excuses for Not Performing Root Cause Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most people know what is good for them. We know it is better to eat vegetables than cookies and chips. We know it is healthier to exercise than watch TV. How come the cookies and chips are flying off shelves while the veggies whither? How come the average person spends 20-some hours in front of the TV while we struggle to get one single hour of exercise in a week? The answer is that we don&amp;rsquo;t do what is best for us. We more often do what we feel like and what is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same logic applies to plants and mills. For example, most everyone agrees that we should fix the root causes of problems rather than the symptoms. However, most of us don&amp;rsquo;t fix the root causes of problems. We keep repairing breakdowns and patching problems with temporary solutions year in and year out. How come? There are a million excuses, but none of those make any sense if we look at what is best for a company over time. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the most common excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. &amp;ldquo;There is no time for people to do root cause problem elimination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is a bit more complex than it may seem at first glance. Most companies are caught in a catch-22 situation where there are so many breakdowns and no extra people to do root cause analysis. In this situation, it is unlikely that root cause is the answer to the plant&amp;rsquo;s problem. Why? Because people have no time to do root cause analysis. They are too busy fixing problems, and there are usually so many obvious improvements to be done without doing a root cause analysis. Common examples are to improve alignment, basic lubrication, implement inspection rounds, implement basic planning and scheduling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adding more people to solve the situation will, in many cases, just increase cost, since people are used ineffectively due to poor planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most frontline people will recognize the problem. Unfortunately, top management often doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the problem, or it understands the problem but is pressured to perform a quick fix to the situation. Either way, the outcome is often to demand cost-cutting very quickly, which means cutting people (contractor first, then the in-house staff), which over the long term just amplifies the problems of being reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is, as mentioned above, usually to implement some basic reliability practices, which in turn will cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. &amp;ldquo;We have tried it, but root cause is too complicated and doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as a practical tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is common to see complicated and cumbersome root cause analysis methods that are supplied by advisors to industry. There are many documentation tools in RCA that can be very complicated. Also, consider that the more complicated the methods are, the more advising time is needed from consultants. If you have had a bad experience with RCA, give it another try with a straight commonsense approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. &amp;ldquo;People are not doing the analysis right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root cause analysis is not primarily about how problems are documented and what charts you use. It is about basic critical and creative thinking. The thinking concepts are easy, but they are hard for most of us to follow. It takes practice to become a good root cause analyst and critical thinker. Remember that most people form opinions based on very little information (poor critical thinking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, if you ask random people how they researched what car to buy, decided who to hire or promote, what party to vote for, what to think about coal fuel vs. wind mills, or even what research was done to select their faith, you will understand that most people have spent their whole lives making decisions primarily on an emotional basis. Evaluating problems in your plant works the same way. We tend to rush our thinking and make decisions on an emotional basis rather than logical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if a pump is not pumping the required flow, then we decide to change the pump without further information. If a motor is running hot, let&amp;rsquo;s change it out. If a bearing breaks down, it is a mechanical problem. These decisions are almost always taken without RCA and very often without any information at all about the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to have patience with your peers and work on helping them focus on facts and logic. The thinking patterns for most of us are deeply engrained. It requires practice and a good thinking methodology to break out of the patterns to which we are accustomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/43Hbj_i1p8Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Implement an Effective Chain-wear Monitoring Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Chain-wear monitoring has been a part of equipment reliability programs since the first link was forged. It is such an integral part of an organization&amp;rsquo;s reliability program that it has become part of industry slang as in the phrase, &amp;ldquo;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chains are a part of almost every industrial process. They are found in a plant&amp;rsquo;s material-handling transportation system, key components in the operation of hoists and cranes, or as a part of the connection that controls a safety stop device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of its function, the failure of any component that makes up a chain is costly to the owner, if not disastrous. Even though we would all agree that a chain failure is undesirable, modern industry&amp;rsquo;s chain-wear monitoring has remained varied in its approach and frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, chain reliability inspections are applied through a periodic inspection sampling procedure or replacement schedule. Visual inspections are commonly applied to the inspection of chain for wear identification, which is time-consuming to accomplish with tremendous dependence on the inspector&amp;rsquo;s experience, attitude and processing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technology exists that makes this costly approach no longer the only available avenue for chain monitoring to today&amp;rsquo;s maintenance departments. The application of infrared photoelectric optical systems allows for inspections that are more precise, less expensive and result in trending information to reduce failure opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/14d7ef58-7c4a-4cd4-a809-e78212ed9a81_figure1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 554px; height: 761px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Examples of worn chain pins identified through the use of an infrared photoelectric chain-wear monitoring system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Explanation of the Photoelectric Process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared photoelectric technology is utilized in many aspects of our daily lives without most of us even being aware of its existence. Examples of photoelectric detectors include the sensor components on the most advanced types of security systems, safety controls on door-closure systems for elevators and transit systems, and even as bottle fill-level monitors in high-production bottling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The applications of this technology are certainly vast and varied in nature. The basic principle relies upon an infrared light source (transmitter) that generates a pulsed IR beam to a series of infrared sensors (receiver), which in turn monitor that beam. The combination of the transmitter and a receiver is referred to as a photoelectric detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transmitter and the receiver are installed on opposite sides of the area to be monitored, and a signal is generated when the receiver detects obstruction of the pulsed infrared beam. A car headlight and a photocell could be used in a science project to create a very crude photoelectric detector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of infrared light to this process is due to its increased receiver sensitivity and penetration. Infrared light is a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radio signals, visible light and X-rays. While infrared energy is similar to visible light and shares many of its characteristics, infrared energy is invisible to the human eye due to its difference in wavelengths. Infrared energy has wavelengths of 0.75 microns to 1 millimeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The covers on photoelectric detectors are made of special materials that are designed to block out visible light while allowing maximum penetration of IR energy. This is what allows the use of infrared photoelectric detectors on a well-lighted factory floor or even in direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Historical Perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If most companies were to document their chain-monitoring programs, you should not be surprised to find statements such as, &amp;ldquo;Replace chain when conveyor malfunctions during production,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The last chain replacement was about five years ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s due.&amp;rdquo; Even what is viewed as a proactive program for chain-wear monitoring has historically used the method of choosing an arbitrary sample of a nominal 10-foot section of chain and physically measuring it for stretch, which would indicate wear. Obviously, there is a significant degree of risk in using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sampling plans are dependent on the sample providing information that is consistent with the condition of the entire system. Limiting inspection to a 10-foot section of chain within a 1,000-foot-long system sets up a situation where the likelihood of actually sampling the area of worst wear provides detection &amp;ldquo;odds&amp;rdquo; that even a Las Vegas gambler would find unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another concern is how accurately measurements are being produced when the measurement device is a standard hardware-quality tape measure. The historical alternative &amp;mdash; visual inspection of the chain &amp;mdash; can certainly identify chain wear, but once again can the production schedule tolerate the extreme downtime of such a labor-intensive approach, which needs a stationary chain to do an adequate inspection? Many types of chain are lubricated or painted, and those same coatings that protect chain from wear and corrosion mask typical wear indicators when performing visual inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last approach that is often used is that of periodic replacement based on chain age. This system of assuring chain reliability may help to reduce production downtime, but the cost of replacing reliable chain just because it is due can never be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Infrared Photoelectric Chain-wear Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Infrared photoelectric instruments specifically designed for chain-wear monitoring typically use referenced technology to accurately measure the distance between the leading edges of each center link on the chain. With accurate link-to-link measurements, these monitors can easily identify individual links or pins that show signs of abnormal wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unit pictured below is a portable battery-operated device capable of monitoring all combinations of 3-, 4- and 6-inch chain. Alternate units are available that are designed for single-pitch chain. These monitors are capable of in-motion monitoring of chain to allow the inspection to be performed without disruption of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If permanently installed units are utilized, continuous monitoring of the chain can be accomplished instantaneously, identifying any chain links that exceed the programmed limits. Both status monitoring units and permanently installed units identify any link that is outside of preset size lengths through illumination of alarm lights identifying the specific problem area. Most units will provide the operator with options as to how data can be processed, including alternate avenues for monitoring, data review and problem-area identification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/1d98ce7f-a568-4fcf-85cf-1c4f1e0159f4_figure2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 484px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A portable infrared photoelectric chain-wear monitoring system mounted on a conveyor. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automated abnormality identification and marking systems identify each link that is above the wear threshold, and if combined with trend-analysis software monitoring, either periodic or continuous scanning will allow for planned replacement of chain only when it is truly needed. Trending software requires a defined start/stop point to enable accurate comparisons. This is usually accomplished through a uniquely identified link installed in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An option for start/stop link identification can be accomplished by permanently mounting a magnet assembly in the chain itself, which will automatically signal the unit to start and stop the data-recording sessions each time the magnet passes unit sensors. This option provides easily understandable data presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/69728b76-8d6a-4802-98b6-4fc351d51d22_figure3.jpeg" style="width: 518px; height: 1194px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;An example of reporting software showing a bar graph of link set measurements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several unique features that can be obtained from specially designed software allow for valuable analysis tools such as adjustable span length acceptance criteria, data-recording measurement ranges (individual link, individual link sets or 10-foot sections), trending overlay and charting options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In normal usage chain, the majority of chain wear occurs at the friction points. The friction points are those areas where the pin engages the center link. Wear occurs on the center pin itself, on the inside of the center link or in most cases a combination of both. Manufacturers supply replacement growth charts that provide a value to determine the maximum length of &amp;ldquo;chain growth&amp;rdquo; that is recommended as a guideline for chain replacement. This is usually based on inspection data that is gathered from the commonly performed nominal 10-foot measurement technique. An example would be that a 10-foot section of new chain measured at 120 inches should be replaced when it reaches 124 to 124.5 inches in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A concern that should be recognized is that wear may or may not be evenly distributed across that measured section of the chain. The wear on one link may be much more severe than on an adjoining link. This type of condition presents the possibility of a chain on the verge of failure measuring well within acceptable tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The use of individual-link measurement technology eliminates this type of error, increasing the reliability of the inspection and reducing the risk of catastrophic chain failure. A scanning infrared photoelectric system provides accuracy within 0.02 inches. This is even more significant when the user recalls that this is being measured on in-motion chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/16/287cdb9e-bd2d-466d-97e1-44c97f5d244d_figure4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 484px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;This&amp;nbsp;system is&amp;nbsp;equipped with an automatic paint-sprayer marking system designed to mark individual links that are not found to be within acceptable tolerance limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Operating Personnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although operation of standard infrared photoelectric chain-monitoring systems is not much more difficult than the operation of a typical desktop personal computer, there are considerations that should be evaluated when operating this type of system. The first and most important is safety. Anytime personnel are required to physically work around moving industrial equipment, there are safety issues that need to be carefully monitored. At a minimum, safety training should include OSHA safety training and plant-specific safety review. Lockout-tagout procedures must also be followed to prevent chain movement during monitor installation and removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the type of unit being inspected, operator training needs to address powered chain unit operation (conveyors, cranes, lifts, etc.), unit installation, line walk-down requirements, software operation, file storage and recovery, and data interpretation. Often two-sided access to chain is not possible and may require sight cut-outs. This operation requires an individual who understands the load requirements of various types of units to prevent structural weakening of required supports. Since this type of inspection is reliability-based and is not a code, requirement acceptance criteria need to be established in order to provide useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of maximum growth tolerances requires individuals with experience in its development. Recommended training and experience may vary, but a good guideline would include 30 hours of classroom-style training covering all related subjects and a minimum of six months of hands-on experience before considering an individual qualified to perform inspections independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The utilization of infrared photoelectric technology to accomplish chain monitoring is a major improvement leap in this important part of a company&amp;rsquo;s reliability program. The cost savings alone justify the research as to the applicability of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent example of cost savings was developed by a meat-processing company that used the nominal 10-foot measurement technique for inspection prior to implementation of this technology. Over a two-year period, their incidents of breakdown were reduced by 100 percent (from an average of seven breakdowns per 12-month period to zero unscheduled breakdowns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was calculated that each breakdown cost the company $2,416 in maintenance repair costs, $3,765 in lost labor time and $1,184 in production revenue. The total cost to the company was $51,555 annually. Additional cost savings were realized in chain-life extension, replacement-part inventory reduction, planned maintenance scheduling and extended-chain replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is only one of many examples in which, if chain dependability is critical to plant production or safety of personnel, the utilization of individual-link inspection methods are self-funding in their application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/bVSc-Ay7_Wo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Execution is Key for Business Strategies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Business strategies developed by companies are often useless. A business strategy is basically a plan for what the company should focus on in the future. It is a promise and guideline to steer a company in the right direction. It&amp;rsquo;s not too different from your personal New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions include things such as losing weight, exercising more, drinking less and improving their marriage in some form. The universal formula for change in any personal-improvement book or business book is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand what to do&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Understand how to do it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Execute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us compare a business strategy with our beloved New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. We know what the problem is, right? We are fat, unhappy, stressed, whatever. We usually know how to improve (drink less, exercise, spend time with the wife), but we fail to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hard truth is that we try a little. We soon realize it is harder to improve than we thought, and we quit. Right? However, the day we get a heart attack, I think most people get a completely new attitude toward exercising, smoking and stress, at least for a while. Of course, there are different reactions. Some people just roll over and wait for the truck to hit, while others start making improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our economic crisis is like a heart attack. Some companies grease their elbows and use the situation to become meaner and leaner. Some are in too bad of shape in order to survive. Others give up. Which company are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time to do the things you didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do before because you were busy making widgets or tons. Take the opportunity to improve your preventive maintenance tasks, revise your planning and scheduling routines, work on your root-cause analysis activities, clean up your storeroom and build that technical database you always cried about not having. Execute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just understanding or thinking about good ideas doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you or your plant/mill/mine anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/PRRlzYV_0k4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>6 Techniques to Error-proof Your Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When faced with the task of improving plant efficiency, the average plant manager breaks the task down by the five or six existing &amp;quot;departmental silos.&amp;quot; Each silo leader subdivides responsibility, repeating the mistake, and passes it on to individuals. As a result, we see young, intelligent engineers overwhelmed by the task handed to them of &amp;quot;get out there and improve maintenance.&amp;quot; The situation is not so bad for the less intelligent or those who have become automatons; they just keep repeating what has gone on forever and collect another paycheck.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	What the plant manager needs is a better way to visualize his situation, a method that will allow him to develop a new strategy. The following insights are based on work done at MIT and by many other professors in &amp;quot;human error&amp;quot; at international centers of learning. The &amp;quot;Error Pyramid&amp;quot; is unique, but the remaining techniques and technologies have been established for 15 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 1 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Most people are familiar with the triangle hierarchy of safety incidents that shows that for every fatality there are seven serious accidents and dozens of minor incidents; and below that, there are many hundreds of near-misses. By reducing the number of near-misses, there will be a corresponding number of minor and serious injuries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Taking the four main activities involved with manufacturing &amp;mdash; safety, reliability, quality assurance and operating performance (accuracy) &amp;mdash; each can be viewed as similar triangles. When placed together, they form a pyramid with a four-sided base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 2 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;People in each silo see their problems as unique and have little time or apparent incentive to work on the other guy&amp;rsquo;s issues. They do, however, use common primary methodologies for solving problems within each of them &amp;mdash; root cause analysis (RCA), cause and effect analysis, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), etc. In my many years of experience, I&amp;#39;ve seen that any change in one area affects the remaining three. In a very specific sense, I always see an improvement in safety and quality as reliability and operational accuracy improve.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Insight No. 3 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient manufacturers have small problem/error pyramids, while the less efficient have massive pyramids that overshadow everything else (i.e., the classic reactive mode of operation).&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	The more errors and mistakes made, the larger the pyramid becomes. Alternatively, the more problems that can be solved, the smaller it becomes. Unfortunately, this is a dynamic situation, and even though people solve problems every day, the pyramid of problems never seems to get smaller. Insight No. 4 will explain why this is true.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; We, and the systems with which we surround ourselves, are the products of the human mind. They are by our very nature prone to make errors at a constant rate (see David L. Weiner&amp;rsquo;s books on the human mind). Therefore, having an understanding of how and why we make mistakes is critical to the task of reducing their frequency and effect.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 4A &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody ever deliberately makes a mistake, particularly those working among a group of peers. As an example, football players often drop passes, but nobody does so deliberately.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the Number of Errors Made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is needed is to not only get better at solving problems but also to take some action that will reduce the number of new problems being created.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 5 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We need a &amp;quot;non-penal system&amp;quot; that allows us to recognize all the errors so that we can classify them by type and respond to the causes across the organization. Not surprisingly, you will find that 90 percent of the issues identified can be considered as latent or systemic.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many old systems were driven by veiled versions of &amp;quot;the beatings will continue until performance improves,&amp;quot; and we have seen just how ineffective this has been. As one director of manufacturing at a plant with an excellent error-proofing program said, &amp;quot;I can see the value of this non-penal system, but if the screw-up was big enough &amp;hellip; someone would still have to go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Let us assume that your company has one of the few problem-solving methodologies (RCA, etc.) that produces documented multiple root causes that also include the latent and systemic issues (even though the team is impotent in initiating corrective actions). What is next?&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Insight No. 6 &amp;mdash;&lt;/strong&gt; Having achieved awareness of a primary issue, you need a formal program of error-proofing. The methodologies are applicable across all four silos, and the training involved should go a long way toward eliminating the existing silo mentality.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Developed in the aviation industry and rapidly adopted by the nuclear and health-care sectors, these techniques are saving billions of dollars each year. My experience is that using formal error-proofing techniques can produce some amazing improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/OoYrl8ccTiI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Vibration Troubleshooting Instruments are Inadequate for PdM</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video explains the difference between troubleshooting instrumentation and the types of instruments and software that are used to implement predictive maintenance programs. Often providers of troubleshooting instruments confuse the industrial market as to the differences between their capabilities and true condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>National Instruments Introduces New Vibration Measurement Software </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	National Instruments recently announced the latest version of its NI Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite software, which provides a comprehensive collection of analysis and signal processing tools for noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) testing, machine condition monitoring (MCM) and audio test applications. Engineers can use the suite as stand-alone software or combine it with NI hardware and NI LabVIEW system design software to simplify test system development and control. With its new vibration data-logging functionality and other enhancements, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 helps engineers to more easily customize and automate any MCM or NVH test or monitoring application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The NI Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite is an integral part of our MCM applications,&amp;quot; said professor Jay Lee, director of the National Science Foundation&amp;#39;s Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems at the University of Cincinnati. &amp;quot;The suite has tremendously reduced system development time and has helped us achieve a variety of efficiencies throughout our machine analysis process.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 simplifies the development of MCM, NVH and audio measurement systems with several new features, including a ready-to-run data-logging virtual instrument that makes it possible for engineers to save data continuously or based on specific criteria such as triggers or time. Engineers can configure the data logger and run it as long as necessary for a variety of sensor types, including accelerometer, tachometer and proximity probes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The measurement suite also includes the Sound and Vibration Assistant, a stand-alone software module for quickly acquiring, analyzing and logging acoustic, noise and vibration data. Additionally, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite provides easy-to-use application examples for impact test and swept sine analysis. These enhancements for the 2011 version add flexibility and high-performance capabilities to a variety of sound and vibration measurement projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By integrating with LabVIEW, the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 helps engineers increase test throughput with advanced parallel processing capabilities, among many other advantages of LabVIEW. LabVIEW 2011 can dramatically increase development efficiency through new engineering-specific libraries and its ability to interact with almost any hardware device. Together, LabVIEW and the Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite 2011 help engineers integrate individual measurement types into a single, reconfigurable platform so they can do their jobs faster, better and at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Quick Guide to PM Development and Execution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In many organizations, groups are often trying to chase the latest buzzwords of the day and yet have never established the foundation required to support those efforts. PM development and execution are classic examples. For this discussion, when I refer to PMs, I am talking about both preventive maintenance and condition-based maintenance tasks. This is by no means an exhaustive explanation of all of the considerations necessary for a comprehensive PM program. It is intended as a rough guide to foster continued discussion into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stop doing non-value added PMs or task steps within the PM. We can never seem to find time to update or correct the PM tasks or frequencies but can always find time to continue doing the wrong work (go figure! ).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assuming that you already have a PM program in place, start with the equipment where you are bleeding or hemorrhaging the most. This is often not your most critical assets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the failure modes of the equipment. The blowout preventer in the Gulf oil spill had more than 260. Per the SKF manual, a bearing has more than 50 failure modes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use the Reliability-Centered Maintenance Logic Tree to determine the tasks. Use condition-based monitoring (CBM) techniques where possible first because it&amp;rsquo;s less expensive, especially compared to an overhaul. Yes, some groups still do overhaul maintenance for no other reason than they have done it that way for the last 20 years. Your equipment actually defines the type of PM, as not everything lends itself to predictive technologies, as an example. Run to failure is an option, provided you can limit the collateral damage. CBM often extends or widens the failure detection window over time-based activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define tasks that allow you to find the equipment in the act of failure with respect to each of the failure modes. Failure modes and effects analysis is a great tool for these items, but many groups can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the time to perform them in developing their procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create the procedures using standard text.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Focus on precision maintenance to a specification (i.e. torque values, belt tension).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure to look for hidden failures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set the frequency of the task based on experience and history, if you have it. Generally, in very broad terms, it should be one half the width of the failure detection window. Keep in mind that you need time to effectively plan and schedule the equipment restoration in a proactive manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inspect and audit the work processes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure the outcome and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solicit feedback from the crafts performing the PM tasks by adding a continuous improvement loop.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Great procedures are a start, but recognize that you may need to focus on changing the behaviors of the people who are doing the work. The behaviors may be as much as 80 percent of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish partnerships with the other stakeholders such as production and engineering. As an example, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do the PM when production doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you access to the equipment. No matter how well you maintain it, if the equipment is not operated correctly, no level of maintenance can keep it running. If engineering bought the least cost equipment and installed it with poor methods, you most likely can&amp;rsquo;t overcome that either. Realize the total life cycle costs (LCC) may be upward of 20 times the initial installed cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When you have a failure, you should perform an autopsy to determine why the equipment failed. Review the task procedures and frequencies to determine why you never caught the failure mode in the act of failure. Update the PM based on the findings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/e0i-wMB_B-Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Ultrasound for Condition Monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the past decade, the capabilities of many condition-based assessment tools, sometimes called predictive technologies, have significantly expanded. The hardware has become more compact, more rugged and much easier to use. The companion software applications have become more powerful with exponentially increasing capabilities. Additionally, the software tools have become more mainstream with much less reliance on proprietary protocol and programming. This situation has led to expanded use of these sophisticated tools to monitor and assess equipment health. We have seen vibration analysis, oil analysis, infrared, motor circuit analysis and many other non-destructive tools become very popular. Many organizations now stress their use as a prominent part of the maintenance and reliability programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) theory points out, it is important for an organization to use multiple predictive technologies in a program. The type and how much of each predictive technology used directly depends on what the organization&amp;rsquo;s critical equipment is, how this critical equipment fails, what the failure consequences are, and finally what technologies will proactively detect this defect early before catastrophic failure occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all that being said, I have come to admire the capabilities and financial return to an organization of one specific type of these predictive technologies. I have seen in the past decade that one of the simplest, easiest to learn and, coincidently, the most underrated technology gives an organization or facility a great return for the investment. The problem has been that it sometimes gets ignored, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of my all-time favorite comedians is Rodney Dangerfield. His moniker and tag line was that he &amp;ldquo;gets no respect.&amp;rdquo; Rodney is no longer with us, but his comedy routines will live into eternity. As his memory lives on, certainly many in the world now give Rodney the respect as a genius of comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think there is a predictive technology that typically &amp;ldquo;gets no respect&amp;rdquo; because of its simplicity, ease of use and low investment cost. It is airborne and structure-borne ultrasound technology. I have labeled airborne and structure-borne ultrasound as the Rodney Dangerfield of predictive technologies. It just gets little to no respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Years ago after having significant training in this predictive technology from Mark Goodman, Gary Mohr and Doug Waetjen from UE Systems, I became aware of ultrasound&amp;rsquo;s versatility of applications, ability to detect failure modes on many of our critical pieces of equipment, ease of use and, most importantly, its significant return on the tool&amp;rsquo;s investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Airborne and structure-borne capabilities are varied. I would categorize the three major application areas as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1. Compressed air/gas leak detection for energy conservation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s economic conditions, it is critical to eliminate waste by locating and correcting costly leaks of compressed air and specialty gasses. An added benefit of correcting compressed air leaks is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that are the result of the electricity savings associated with the leaks. Both cost savings and greenhouse gas reductions can be measured, documented and reported using the software that comes with the ultrasonic detectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2. Bearing monitoring for condition-based lubrication and slower-speed bearings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the biggest contributing factors to bearing failure is overlubrication. Ultrasonic technology can identify which bearings need to be lubricated and then ensure that the bearings are not overlubricated. Software allows us to report and document these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3. Electrical inspection, especially enclosed switchgear for safety issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ultrasound can be used to scan enclosed switchgear while it is energized to determine if there is corona, tracking or arcing before opening the switchgear to inspect visually or with infrared. By scanning first with ultrasound, you eliminate the risk of opening the cabinet &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo; and being exposed to an arc flash situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have witnessed ultrasound technology&amp;rsquo;s ability to detect defects in critical equipment in our Cargill facilities. I have seen the tool&amp;rsquo;s payback completely in its first use on an air survey. We have experienced this at many facilities. After one air survey, we identified air leaks that - after we fixed the leaks - saved us three times the initial investment of the tool in one year. This was only looking at one basic application of ultrasound. After additional training of our people on further applications, we continue to identify defects when corrected, saving us energy, plant downtime and operating cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Therefore, I would highly recommend all maintenance and reliability programs to concentrate on initiating or expanding airborne and structure-borne ultrasound use in your plant. Please remember the Rodney Dangerfield of predictive technologies. Give ultrasound some respect and please apply its use in your facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/NSzuPj8tTyo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Create Detailed Inspection and Detection Strategies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Detailed inspections require the right type of person with the right mind-set, attitude and training. Most mills/mines/plants have some type of inspection program, but unfortunately the inspections are often ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There may be many reasons why inspections often aren&amp;rsquo;t effective, but one reason is that inspections are not done detailed enough to find problems. Many inspectors simply walk by equipment, making sure it wasn&amp;rsquo;t stolen last night, and if they are in a good mood, they may make sure it hums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example 1: A typical pump and motor coupling configuration in a paper mill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/6/664ce8bf-1191-409f-b5a6-ed4e21e6fcf8_quality-inspections01.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This plant has an inspection system in place, which means Mr. or Mrs. X should have checked it. I watched this piece of equipment intermittently for a whole week, and it looked pretty much the same. Some questions would immediately come up when an experienced inspector looks at this equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experienced inspector would note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I can&amp;rsquo;t see cables well, so the condition can&amp;rsquo;t be checked.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I can&amp;rsquo;t take a stroboscope to the coupling because the inspection ports are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The motor is running hotter than necessary because it is covered with dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I can&amp;rsquo;t see the oil level on the pump.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The breather on the pump is most likely clogged.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The breather is just a &amp;ldquo;goose neck&amp;rdquo; breather allowing dirty air into the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I wonder if the motor has jack bolts to allow precision alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			There are no flow meter or inlet or outlet pressure gauges on the pump. How would I know if it operates on the right B.E.P.?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There are no spots or hookups for taking vibration and temperature readings. I wonder where the last guy took the readings so I can compare readings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example 2: A jacking bolt (push bolt) on a motor in a refinery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/6/e96bb022-11de-470e-96fc-b61237a7f4fd_quality-inspections02.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is a close-up of a jacking bolt on a motor base. What would an experienced inspector see? This photo was taken in the southern United States&amp;nbsp;in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experienced inspector would note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The bolt is touching the base. As it gets warmer, the bolt will lengthen due to thermal expansion and push the motor out of alignment. I need to back the bolt off.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Great, there is a jacking bolt there, so we can align it well. But I wonder why they don&amp;rsquo;t buy them with jacking bolts in the first place, since it would be a lot cheaper than putting them in after installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example 3: Inspecting a solenoid valve in a food plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/6/9d2a157f-aaa7-4ade-9668-d15e60047a35_quality-inspections03.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 267px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the picture, you see a typical solenoid valve on a hydraulic system. An inexperienced inspector may just look at it and confirm the valve is mounted and that the electrical cable is undamaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experienced inspector would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			take the temperature on the coil, knowing that if the valve sticks internally, the coil often gets hot because it is trying to move the sticking valve;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		would listen to the solenoid for a buzzing sound, which is created when the solenoid is trying to move the valve multiple times; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			make sure there are no leaks, realizing leaks can cause performance problems and create additional heat.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Example 4: Pneumatic regulator in a surface mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/6/1531460b-d7ac-45cb-904b-e0303becd1fb_quality-inspections04.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The picture illustrates a pneumatic regulator that has been in the game for a while. Most inspectors would not look at the instrument at all since mechanics feel it belongs to instrumentation, while instrumentation techs seldom do physical checks of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An experienced mechanic would put his or her hand in front of the weep hole and check if air is leaking out of the weep hole. If he or she feels air, that person would know the membrane inside the unit is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leadership and inspections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These four simple examples illustrate that there is a difference between walking by equipment and actually understanding how to inspect it. As leaders in operations and maintenance, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just give people a list of 40 equipment numbers and assume they know and are willing to inspect equipment correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Make sure we have a documented system for how to inspect equipment and why we are doing these inspections. IDCON has more than &lt;a href="http://store.noria.com/Preventive-Maintenance-and-Condition-Monitoring-Standards-P74.aspx"&gt;100 standards&lt;/a&gt; that we use in our projects and training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Train people in how to do inspections. Even if many operators and craftspeople would know the simple techniques above, training and coaching the execution of the inspections are important to change attitudes and explain the level of detail that is needed.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Justifying a Predictive Maintenance Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;How do I quantify my PdM finds? Where do I go to establish my credibility?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grow a thick skin, fast. You have to develop some way of bringing some sense to the finds you have made in your predictive maintenance program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that trust has been established and your routes are being executed, you wonder if the work you are doing is worthwhile. Are there any finds to report on to show you are doing a good job? How do you quantify the finds that have been reported and put a dollar sign to the finds to prove the system is working to the benefit of the company or department? How do you show that you are saving money and that the trust you have been afforded is well founded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nobody teaches us how to do this. It is one of the most difficult processes you have to establish in your PdM program, but it&amp;rsquo;s essential to justify your program&amp;rsquo;s existence. My way of quantifying a good find is simply to use a delay avoidance process. I take the cost per hour of rolling time and multiply that times the number of hours saved by not having to shut down. There are a lot of fancy systems out there where this figure multiplied by that then divided by something else gives you a number. Why should it be so complicated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/29/f1304e0c-e201-40ef-9682-236e005cb2c8_armadillo_300x2001.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;My first find saved four hours. Instead of being down for seven hours, we were down three hours. Infrared thermography showed a differential between the four pistons in the project block. I selected the bottom right cylinder, and it was correct. Hooray! Repairs were made to the cylinder, it was pressurized and there was no leak. We came ahead and rolled for the duration on the repaired system. The cost avoidance was 4 x $40,000, or an avoidance of $160,000. Through this find, my infrared camera was paid for, my wages were taken care of for the rest of the year, the system worked, and I finally realized that what I was doing was the right thing. This showed that the PdM program could be very successful and a value-added exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are your thoughts, stories and insights on documenting cost savings/avoidances through PdM? How have you justified your program&amp;rsquo;s funding and existence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/ZDmVdunSxzg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Implement Modern Condition Monitoring Systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	To be more competitive, efficient and cost-effective, more and more companies are implementing automation and remote condition monitoring systems, sensors, alarms, PLCs, accelerometers, human-machine interface panels, etc. Now many are implementing wireless networks to monitor equipment globally at remote monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These modern systems are truly technological marvels and amaze even the most jaded technophiles. But we must be careful because the solutions we implement today are going to lead to the problems we must grapple with tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Back 15 years ago when I first got active in the maintenance management industry, managers did not know what was going on in their business because they did not have any reports other than manual entries. Then we implemented a CMMS system, and they did not know what was going on in their business because they had more than 600 reports and over 200 computer-generated graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now forensic engineers, those who research major disasters, are discovering that many of the calamities were caused by faulty sensors or even ignored alarms due to alarm floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s similar to the situation where computer users have to deal with memorizing various passwords to get access to information available in databases, bank records and social media outlets. Since it is now so easy to automate alarm codes, sensors and tracking systems, it is becoming increasingly difficult to respond, as well as determine which critical issue to address. Also, many of these sensors are battery-controlled. When the battery dies, the alarm sends faulty or no information. Expired batteries are not easy to correct or detect from a remote location, and that may leave the facility vulnerable to potential emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To increase uptime, believe it or not, a major auto transmission manufacturer set up speakers to play irritating music to signal maintenance workers to fix the problem equipment. The company had more than 700 assets at this one facility. On top of all of the factory noise, about 20 work centers bellowed cacophonous sounds of various different types of songs. When I asked a maintenance technician how he liked this, his body repulsed at the mere mention of the music alarms and said, &amp;ldquo;You become numb and ignore it after a while.&amp;rdquo; And yet, the company can&amp;rsquo;t figure out why it experiences high turnover in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automation companies are recognizing the challenges and complexity of this process and are working to implement dashboard control systems where energy and equipment management systems can be made instantly by remote operations. These interfaces are being designed for each user and provide only the information needed at various levels. Also, virtual training programs are being created to condition workers to deal with abnormal failures and issues that normally occur but could have devastating results. Some companies are taking a page out of sports teams&amp;rsquo; playbooks by filming outages, best practices and creating maintenance training tapes to help develop future workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/hxq9_RTZRHA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Let Risk and Your Equipment Determine Your Maintenance Strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I attend conferences and workshops and read articles on maintenance and reliability, more and more I hear people touting that preventive maintenance is more costly and not the right approach. When we talk about preventive maintenance, we are primarily talking about time-based inspections, but it can include overhauls/rebuilds as well. But before we take statements like these as the gospel and apply them carte blanche to all of our equipment, we need to understand the basis for that reasoning and when to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the Reliability-Centered Maintenance side, we know that we can&amp;rsquo;t apply the single bathtub curve to all equipment failures. We recognize that six separate failure curves exist, and greater than 80 percent of all failures occur outside the infant mortality or end-of-life wear-out zones, meaning the failures are totally random in nature. No doubt that condition-based monitoring using various tools like vibration or temperature monitoring is better and a less costly solution over time-based preventive maintenance, especially overhauls. This provides the basis for some saying that doing more than roughly 20 percent preventive maintenance is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/11/45fd9688-b405-4933-b630-cfcb46130261_prison.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;RCM teaches us that maintenance is really about minimizing the consequences of failure or our risk. Our equipment and the risk should determine our maintenance strategy for any given piece of equipment, not someone telling us preventive maintenance is bad. To do this, we can use a tool like the RCM Logic Tree. The RCM Logic tree places the emphasis on safety and environmental concerns first, followed by production or capacity losses. If we can apply a condition-monitoring strategy, that is our first choice because of the random failures. However, not all equipment lends itself to a condition-monitoring approach, which leads us to time-based preventive maintenance inspections and overhauls. If we can&amp;rsquo;t detect the equipment in the act of failing using either of these based on risk, we can choose to re-engineer the equipment or run it to failure. If we choose &amp;ldquo;run to failure&amp;rdquo;, we should have a proactive strategy that returns the equipment to its normal state as quickly as possible (Neil Bloom&amp;rsquo;s Canon Law). Additionally, we should ensure that running an item to failure doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost us more money due to collateral damage (i.e. a bearing failure that takes out a shaft and the housing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let me give you a few examples of where time-based (cycles, hours, days, etc.) preventive maintenance is a better solution based on the equipment, the failure modes and the consequences of failure. Take a correctional facility and the lamps in the overhead lighting fixtures as the first example. In most organizations, we would choose to run these to failure, correct? In a correctional facility, the cell block has to be cleared of the inmates before the maintenance worker can access the lamps. Depending on the security level of the cell block, it may be more cost-effective to re-lamp all the fixtures at say, a 10,000-hour interval. Next, let&amp;rsquo;s take a contact lens manufacturer. The machines that form, shape and package the contact lens utilize small components like cylinders and small servo drives in tight locations that don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to many condition-monitoring approaches. Past best practice has been to change out some of these components based on the number of strokes or cycles. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s take a 165-valve bottle filler used in the various beverage industries. Organizations with this equipment typically run many shifts during their peak season. The filler valves typically don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves to condition monitoring, and random failures with partial replacements during the shifts are cost-prohibitive due to downtime losses. Most choose to overhaul these fillers on time-based intervals to lessen the risk of failure during the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, in summary, while condition-based monitoring is a more cost-effective solution, the risk and failure modes must determine the maintenance strategy that you apply to your equipment. Use tools like the RCM Logic Tree to help you determine the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/CdPFgM7mNEQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>An Effective PM Program Requires a Solid Foundation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	From previous surveys and depending on the audience responding, either everyone (upward of 90 percent) or a minority (less than 40 percent) has an effective preventive maintenance (PM) program. With the range so broad, let&amp;rsquo;s dig a little deeper to determine what it takes to have an effective PM program. For the purposes of this article, I also am including condition-based monitoring activities such as inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is the strategic and business case for your PM activities? Why are you doing the PM activities, and how did you come to choose those activities? Did you just pull them from the equipment manual? What value is the program providing you? No, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the &amp;ldquo;perceived&amp;rdquo; value. What is the measured value that you can prove to your partners? If they stop operating the equipment to give you a window to do PM activities (condition-based inspections and so forth, not necessarily component replacement activities), what do they get in return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yes, I understand those partners get &amp;ldquo;improved&amp;rdquo; reliability, but why did the equipment fail two days later after the PM was completed? What was improved about that? Oh, infant mortality again, right? OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An effective PM program requires a solid foundation; a bedrock that begins with an asset life plan. That is a strategic maintenance plan that begins with the business case and equipment operational life expectancy at the top level. It must include the operations scheduled use. At the bottom level, you must understand the equipment function, the consequences of failure and address the failure modes. You have to blend all of this together to find potential failures and proactively restore the equipment prior to functional failure. It is a comprehensive strategy, not just simply copying the equipment manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendation from the manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Needless to say, it requires top-level management support. In addition, you will not be effective if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a partnership, especially with your operations partners. You need to measure the value the effort brings and effectively communicate those to your partners and your own group. Where is your continuous improvement loop to optimize the findings from the activities? Are you capturing good information from your technicians back into the work order system? What about your root cause analysis effort that feeds the optimization even more? An effective planning and scheduling function is a requirement as well. The PM activity requires procedures written to a specification with the focus of standardized work and precision maintenance. It includes capturing that &amp;ldquo;tribal knowledge&amp;rdquo; and ensuring it&amp;rsquo;s the right knowledge. From the front-line supervision, there has to be an auditing component from a craft development perspective. Do we have the skills required to perform the work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not, how are you going to develop them? How can you determine success? Where are your measures that show the value? You need an inclusive set &amp;ndash; not around work measurement that creates animosity, but around the processes. Remember, the product is always a result of the process.

					A useful spectral tool for detecting broken rotor bars is the swirl effect, which occurs just below&amp;nbsp;the 5th harmonic of line frequency (300 Hz on a 60 Hz line frequency). Swirl peaks are a confirming tool for the pole-pass frequency sidebands around line frequency and occur at:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Global machine condition monitoring equipment market to reach $2.1B by 2015</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Growth in the world machine condition monitoring equipment market has long been driven by capital investments in industries such as chemicals, petrochemicals, pulp &amp;amp; paper, metals, and heavy equipment manufacturing, among others. Condition monitoring has gained importance, over the years, as companies critically focused on asset utilization and productivity. The need for eliminating catastrophic breakdowns and unnecessary maintenance costs in production processes has and will continue to drive the adoption of condition monitoring solutions across several industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the few industries to flourish in adversity is the machine condition monitoring equipment market. A traditionally resilient vector of the industrial equipment market, machine condition monitoring equipment has recorded hardy growth against a backdrop of increased focus on reducing plant operating costs by reducing maintenance costs, optimizing maintenance activities during planned shutdowns and lowering the instances of unscheduled outages. In addition to rising competition, increasing energy costs and plant maintenance expenditures also eat into corporate bottomlines and machine condition assessment programs help optimize maintenance budgets and ease the pressure on operating expenses. While fall in the business confidence index, tighter lending standards, rising borrowing costs and the resulting shortages in credit availability to finance new plant establishments and upgradations, all resulted in sharp declines in sales of general industrial/plant machinery, demand for machine condition monitoring equipment has in contrast increased. A key reason primarily attributed, is the growing importance of predictive maintenance programs, especially so, against a backdrop of tight liquidity, which exerts added pressure on cost efficiency and justification of both fixed and variable expenses. Also, widespread postponement of new purchases of plant equipment has lengthened the replacement cycle thus requiring additional maintenance of aging installed base of machines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of condition monitoring is therefore magnified during tough economic conditions like the present, since intelligent asset management and control practices and strategies will help production plants identify inefficiencies in maintenance practices and streamline maintenance processes. And this acquires critical significance as companies struggle to reconcile the financial drain caused by current plant overcapacity and reduced market demand and still remain optimally positioned to operate on all cylinders when demand picks up post recession. Machine condition monitoring in this regard reduces the instances of unplanned maintenance, which have the potential to increase costs by disrupting production schedules and triggering collateral damage across the company&amp;rsquo;s entire production line, and time to market capabilities. Additionally, machine failure prevention products such as transmitters and vibration sensors are also seen as a measure to combat price increases, and decline in service levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration-based condition monitoring holds the leading place amongst all condition-based maintenance technologies. On- and off-line vibration monitoring is widely used by industries that perform continuous production processes. In addition to vibration monitoring, other techniques used for machine condition monitoring include wear analysis, thermography, performance monitoring, degradation byproducts, and physical testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	US and Europe account for a lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the global &lt;a href="http://www.strategyr.com/Machine_Condition_Monitoring_Equipment_Market_Report.asp"&gt;Machine Condition Monitoring Equipment&lt;/a&gt; market, as stated by the new market research report. The market in Asia-Pacific is displaying strong appetite for growth, thanks to the continuous infrastructure development and business expansion in the region, especially in emerging countries such as China and India. Of late, deregulation and a substantial increase in foreign direct investments in Asian countries has triggered establishment of new businesses across several industries in developing-economic and trade centers in Asia-Pacific. The resulting shifting of production bases from high cost developed countries to the low cost Asian countries also bodes well for the machine condition monitoring market in this region. Future growth will also be driven by increased availability of sophisticated condition monitoring equipment that can capture subtle changes in machine performance. Demand for &lt;a href="http://www.strategyr.com/Machine_Condition_Monitoring_Equipment_Market_Report.asp"&gt;Thermography Equipment&lt;/a&gt; in Asia-Pacific is expected to record a CAGR of more than 9.0 percent during the analysis period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Major players in the marketplace include Br&amp;uuml;el &amp;amp; Kj&amp;aelig;r Vibro, ClampOn AS, Corrpro Companies Inc., Data Physics Corporation, DLI Engineering Corp, Emerson Process Management, FLIR Systems Inc., GE Energy, Honeywell Process Solutions, ITT Corporation, Kittiwake Developments Limited, PCB Piezotronics Inc., Rockwell Automation Inc., Rohrback Cosasco Systems, Scientific Monitoring Inc., Shinkawa Electric Co., Ltd., SKF Condition Monitoring Inc., SPM Instrument AB, The Timken Company, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How to laser align rotating shafts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This video shows how to laser shaft align rotating shafts as quickly as possible with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;True Position Sensing&amp;quot;, available on the Fixturlaser XA and the Fixturlaser GO. Laser shaft alignment with Fixturlaser&amp;#39;s dual laser, dual sensor design means the system tracks the shafts&amp;#39; true positions, allowing alignments to often be completed with just one set of measurements and adjustments. The XA and GO laser shaft alignment tools are available in the United States from VibrAlign Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Guohua wind turbines choose SKF for remote monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When the fourth-biggest wind farm operator in China increases its installed capacity by 50 percent within one year, that indicates a company that knows its business. And one of the business aspects that all wind farm operators need to take care of is &amp;ldquo;turbine reliability&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; keeping the turbines turning as much as possible and keeping maintenance activities down to a minimum. Reduced or controlled maintenance is always a valuable contribution to bottom-line profitability, but when you&amp;rsquo;ve got 2,000 megawatts of installed capacity, the target by end 2010 for Guohua Energy Investment Company, based in Beijing, China, then you are talking about huge amounts of money.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	That is why Zhou Weihua, deputy general manager of the production department, took a decision in 2008 to evaluate his maintenance strategy and the technology to be applied within that strategy. A critical decision was to look for the most reliable and experienced way to determine the health of his turbines in the fastest and most effective way.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigating on-line monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With a few different turbine designs and sizes out in the field he needed the best possible way to get reliable and regular information about the general condition of selected turbines of these designs and types. At the same time, he wanted identify any typical negative trends that might occur in the various, but differing, field operating conditions that the turbines would be deployed to. Not being satisfied with his previous assessment process of only using temperature readings of gearbox oil and generator bearing housings, he wanted to investigate on-line monitoring, where vibration signals from critical components are collected 24 hours a day and analyzed to determine exactly if and where problems are developing, and how severe any problems were. This type of monitoring would also provide valuable knowledge that could allow critical maintenance to be planned and avoid unexpected and very costly breakdowns. He knew that this type of condition monitoring is widely used in the United States, Europe, Australia, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visiting Germany for first-hand experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	His first step was to make a deep investigation of what technology was available and the quality and knowledge of the suppliers. These investigations covered all the key suppliers of such technology but contacts with other wind farm operators in China quickly brought him to consider SKF and their turbine monitoring system for further discussions. &amp;ldquo;Of course I knew of SKF,&amp;rdquo; said Zhou. &amp;ldquo;They are the No. 1 bearing specialist in the world with expert knowledge in many industries over many years in many countries, also here in China. And I had heard of the SKF WindCon turbine monitoring system but had never used it before. After direct contact with SKF, I heard that they had recently been successful with remote on-line monitoring, where data from the monitored turbine in the wind farm were transmitted by Internet to their specialists for analysis. In order to get first-hand experience of their remote on-line capability, I visited their Intelligence Centre Wind (ICW), their major wind turbine diagnostic center in Hamburg, Germany.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	At the time of Zhou&amp;rsquo;s visit, the SKF ICW in Hamburg was receiving and processing data from more than 600 turbines from across Europe and also from the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In Hamburg, I saw examples of almost all the capabilities of a SKF WinCon system, because there were so many systems deployed in so many wind farms,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The level of detail that the system could give was clearly demonstrated, and the explanations by the people making the analysis clearly indicated that they knew all about wind turbines and the critical machinery. The Hamburg visit gave me the confidence to set up a field trial on some turbines in Guohua wind farms in 2009&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Field trials at 3 wind farms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The field trial involved 11 SKF WindCon systems to be deployed across 3 wind farms; one in Jiangsu province, one in Shadong province and one in Inner Mongolia. Around the time SKF were installing their systems in the Guohua turbines, SKF had opened a Remote Condition Monitoring Centre in Shanghai. Having SKF experts so close was an added benefit to Zhou and he was anxious to get the systems operating and see what the results would be. The data was collected on a local server at each wind farm and transmitted to an SKF server in Shanghai for analysis. Any immediate emergency situation would be reported at once but an &amp;ldquo;emergency situation&amp;rdquo; was not detected at startup of the monitoring, and a report was issued once per month to the wind farm site managers and Zhou. The reports contained the detailed vibration spectra for the key components being monitored, together with a brief statement that summarized the analysis of the data in terms of the condition of the component. But there was also a &amp;ldquo;report grid&amp;rdquo; that indicated the components being monitored and each one had one of three colors: green, yellow or red to give immediate indication of the condition, with green being OK, yellow being a slight to major deviation from the &amp;ldquo;acceptable levels or trends&amp;rdquo;, and red being something requiring immediate attention.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The first results were good, because Zhou could &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; for the first time what was really happening with his critical machinery. The SKF WindCon systems delivered the vibration spectra, similar to those he saw in Hamburg, and the SKF experts in Shanghai interpreted the data in terms of the condition of the bearings, potential misalignment, gear damage etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	During the six months to January 2010, the SKF WindCons provided good information on the turbines, allowing Zhou to determine if and what maintenance would be required. In that period, one of the installed SKF WindCons identified a severely damaged generator gearbox bearing at the Inner Mongolia wind farm.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Success and further deployment of SKF WindCon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF WindCons did their job, said Zhou. &amp;ldquo;They kept me informed and the early identification of the severity of the damaged bearing in Inner Mongolia was enough to allow us to plan for replacement at minimum cost and disturbance to the planned electricity supply from the turbine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the tests, Guohua have installed another 58 SKF WindCons and a further 280 have been ordered for new turbines going into service in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This is the start of a mass application of remote monitoring and Zhou says, &amp;ldquo;We have some knowledge regarding vibration analysis within our own maintenance teams, but I intend to build up more knowledge within the Guohua organization and set up our own remote monitoring center in Beijing for our turbines. A lot of this knowledge and assistance will come from SKF as they provide us with their remote diagnostic monitoring during the coming years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/LAKHPv5XiE4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE notes its favorite monitoring and maintenance apps of 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This past year was a big one for innovation, but few technologies saw as exponential a rise as the mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The creative range could be seen among some of our favorites, such as &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; the iPad magazine created by &lt;em&gt;The Times of London&lt;/em&gt; that takes interactivity to a new level or &lt;em&gt;Flipboard&lt;/em&gt;, the news aggregator app that allows readers to curate a group of publications and easily share the articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, music lovers got to revel in &lt;em&gt;Aweditorium&lt;/em&gt;, a visual, auditory, and informational journey through a world of bands, videos, and songs. &lt;em&gt;Elements&lt;/em&gt; showed that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a Phd. or science geek to creatively interact with the periodic table of elements. And &lt;em&gt;Star Walk&lt;/em&gt; provided an interactive guide to the sky just by pointing your IPhone 4 towards the stars. And these are just a handful of the ones that snared us among the thousands out there already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE has been in the app fast lane, too &amp;mdash; from consumer-friendly apps such as &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/designing-an-even-healthier-app-meet-morsel-2-0/" jquery1293647790089="8"&gt;healthymagination&amp;rsquo;s Morsel&lt;/a&gt;, which helps people chip away at unhealthy habits, to &lt;a href="http://www.gelighting.com/na/home_lighting/design_with_light/iphone_mood_lighting_cam/" jquery1293647790089="9"&gt;GE Lighting&amp;rsquo;s Mood Cam app&lt;/a&gt;, which let&amp;rsquo;s you snap a picture of a room and see how different lighting styles might look to &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cnbc-real-time-for-ipad/id398018310?mt=8" jquery1293647790089="10"&gt;CNBC &lt;em&gt;Real-Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the only free app that offers real-time stock quotes from the NYSE and NASDAQ before, during, and after market hours. (The professional version gives real-time information and analytics on over 100 international markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But three that particularly caught our eye this year are the ones that most people might not at first think of when it comes to apps &amp;mdash; as they&amp;rsquo;re for planes, trains and electric utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;PDS Movement Planner: &lt;/strong&gt;This app for GE rail customers provides real-time rail &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/rails-rebirth-software-hybrid-technologies-spark-a-revolution/" jquery1293647790089="11"&gt;monitoring of all things &amp;ldquo;train&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Currently in a pilot program, it can revolutionize transportation solutions by providing information on traffic, track scheduling, cargo information, geo-location, and train speed. This app makes it possible for rail companies to leverage the &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/railedge-tech-faster-smarter-trains-to-save-millions/" jquery1293647790089="12"&gt;Movement Planner software system&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; which acts like air traffic control for railroads &amp;mdash; on the go so that they know everything going on with each train they have in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Transformers:&lt;/strong&gt; This colorful and vivid app, also in a pilot phase, allows customers, GE sales teams, and field service engineers to remotely monitor and diagnose GE transformers and transformer stations that supply electricity to homes and business around the country.

            <title>PdM software innovations lead to improved operating margins</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The current crop of predictive maintenance (PdM) management software now delivers instantaneous decision-making power for those engineers and plant managers charged with wringing the maximum utility from their facilities while conserving maintenance costs. Capable of instantly analyzing and interpreting vibration data &amp;ndash; along with ferrography, used-lubricant analysis and visual inspections &amp;ndash; today&amp;rsquo;s PdM software not only delivers integrated and prioritized information to plant managers in their offices, but throughout the entire organization via enterprise-wide &amp;ldquo;electronic in-trays,&amp;rdquo; text messages, pager alerts and even HTML pages accessible via a common Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Predicting the repair needs of critical components in lathes, mills, turbines, fans, drills, pumps and any other rotating device allows today&amp;rsquo;s MRO executives to control the destiny of their plant&amp;rsquo;s operations by preventing unexpected shutdowns in the first place. This ability to plan for the future is no longer the domain of Fortune 500 companies, as PdM software&amp;rsquo;s power to deliver answers, not merely data, has even trickled down to small and mid-sized businesses. However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building upon the past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that plant engineers relied on run-to-fail (RTF) maintenance schedules &amp;ndash; a method that almost guaranteed unscheduled process line shutdowns. Hardly satisfactory, the maintenance industry welcomed advances in computerization as a means to help prevent expensive machine breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we started out doing machine condition analysis for the U.S. Navy back in 1966, the vibration work was all manual,&amp;rdquo; recalls Dean Lofall, the product development manager for Woburn, Mass.-based Azima DLI, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced suppliers of vibration analysis instruments and PdM programs. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;d have a group of engineers that went out on the ship for 10 days to gather all the measurements via analog instrumentation tape recordings. It would then be played back by technicians through a processor to produce a five-foot high stack of graphs. For the next three weeks, a group of engineers would go through all the data, manually categorizing all the machinery and making specific repair recommendations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even the private sector &amp;ldquo;made do&amp;rdquo; with rudimentary results while absorbing huge manpower expenses. Automakers and power companies, for example, would maintain vast banks of vibration experts for the sole purpose of tracking machine life. Perhaps the persistent vision of massive mainframes crunching data from cumbersome Winchester drives possibly accounts for the reluctance of some individuals to believe that today&amp;rsquo;s basic PdM software can run on nothing more than a first-generation Pentium desktop computer. Yet, given the comparative low cost of entry and the gains to be had, maintenance managers of even small manufacturing facilities are now turning to full-featured PdM systems. Such are the advances that have been made over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s systems save money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Overly cautious, prevention-minded systems of the last decade wasted valuable maintenance resources by manually analyzing each piece of new data, whether the machines needed attention or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve observed that 80 percent of the machines in a typical plant will have no serious mechanical faults,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;So why waste time on machine parts that have no need for replacement? State-of-the-art predictiveprograms employ expert systems to weed out machine test-results that look acceptable; thus allowing analysts to focus only on those machines that may have faults. The time saved by not manually reviewing the data from every single machine in a plant is significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an example: Some 30 years after its initial work for the Navy, Azima DLI deployed its expert system of PdM software to analyze data for thousands of machines within the U.S. Navy Sealift Command. A subsequent study of 332 such machines confirmed savings of between $47,000 and $62,000 per month, as opposed to manually calculating the data with in-house engineers. The accuracy rate proved to be 8 percent greater with the PdM system, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s PdM systems even predict the future of new equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Spectacular gains in maintenance efficiency and dollar savings have resulted from integrating modern PdM systems into existing facilities. Yet, the use of PdM to predict the useful life of brand newmachines promises to save organizations even more money. In recent years, DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Toledo North assembly plant avoided costly downtime by accurately predicting maintenance failures in newly purchased equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During the launch period of this new plant we requested evaluations via vibration analysis and infrared analysis as one of our buy-off criteria before we signed off on the equipment and took ownership,&amp;rdquo; recalls Terry Kulczak, the maintenance advisor for the Toledo plant. &amp;ldquo;We had already settled on the Azima DLI system for this task because we had good success with it at our Durango plant in Newark, Delaware.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kulczak explains that his team used their PdM system to evaluate more than 600 pieces of new equipment such as regenerative thermal oxidizer motors, water pumps, cooling fans and gearboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the software, we found that there were some machines out there that weren&amp;rsquo;t up to spec,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;Some had bad bearings, alignment problems and improperly sized shims, which led to excessive vibration. These had to be changed out, and it was all done under warranty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At least 106 pieces of equipment needed adjustment or new parts. In his report to management, Kulczak estimated that the maintenance costs to repair these defects &amp;ndash; had they not been detected in advance &amp;ndash; would amount to at least $31,000, with a possible maximum cost of $112,000. Production losses due to failed machinery would have resulted in even greater losses to the plant&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The software analyzed the data and spit out the summary sheet, so you can go back into the data and decipher it a little more closely if you want,&amp;rdquo; says Kulczak. &amp;ldquo;From what I understand, older software out there did not have these features. A lot of the contractors questioned our calls, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t use DLI. But we showed them the data and it turns out we were right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains made possible through improved data collectors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The above-mentioned, bottom-line savings earned by investments in maintenance management have occurred through the continuous evolution of each element of the PdM chain. Progress has been achieved at every step, beginning with technological advances in field instrumentation that measures torsional vibration, torque and horsepower, motor current, structural vibration, shaft alignment, and acoustics with every increasing accuracy and fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even more important, an emphasis on portability has placed condition monitoring into the hands, literally, of production floor personnel. As proof, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s DCX pen-tablet handheld computer can host a replica of an entire condition monitoring database &amp;ndash; capabilities previously reserved only for high-end desktops. With analysis tools and automated diagnostics onboard, the user enjoys a tremendous advantage in obtaining immediate answers while in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s versatile and portable data collection systems, we&amp;rsquo;re basically doing EKGs on machines,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Just like when you go to the doctor, an EKG will detect any early problems. Similarly, machines will give off precursors, or early indicators, of future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced processing tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next-greatest boon for plant managers can be attributed to the manner in which this data is now processed with almost real-time speed to deliver intelligent answers regarding machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s vibration analysis software uses an empirical, rule-based logic system that utilizes order-normalized data, spectrum analysis, cepstrum analysis, demodulated data analysis, and other proprietary algorithms to deliver information with an emphasis on providing a straightforward user interface. All data and functions are made available from a single-layer intuitive screen that is quickly organized via a built-in setup wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If you have a failing machine, then today&amp;rsquo;s software can tell you the severity with a hierarchy rating system, like a five out of 10,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll give you the actual fault or faults. It might be a bad roller bearing in addition to an imbalance. It should also tell you the repair recommendation based on whatever faults it finds. That is why the system is so useful to plant managers; they don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to get into all the details. The system automatically does that for them by simply presenting credible information upon which they can base their decisions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real dollars-and-cents gains of utilizing PdM software come from employing these systems to continuously evaluate machine conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With continuous monitoring, an engineer can keep a much closer eye on operations, which brings about the real savings of predictive maintenance,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;For example, there always will be a small percentage of machines, say 4 to 5 percent, where you can see that it is not even going to last six months down the road. So you had better take care of any problems immediately. On the other hand, the most common thing we note is that most machines are running just fine. That&amp;rsquo;s important, because without such predictive information a lot of people would tear down the machine every three years just based on the calendar. But the PdM software would indicate that this machine is still doing fine; no repairs are needed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gains in integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While maintenance success stories rely on ever-more powerful data collection and process tools, the breakthrough benefits result from the integration of this important maintenance data into one seamless source of concise information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s Voyager is an integrated environment that combines vibration analysis, used-lubricant analysis, infrared thermography libraries and even visual inspections (input via portable data collection instruments) to provide a single view of the maintenance status of a plant&amp;rsquo;s machinery. By utilizing one common platform to combine and compare various data sources, a cross-technology scoring can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This yields a prioritized ranking so that facility managers can schedule plant-wide repairs in order of urgency. Reports can be customized to include detailed plots and images to justify comprehensive, program-management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integration of PdM software recently proved itself at Tri-State Generation &amp;amp; Transmission&amp;rsquo;s Escalante generation station. Azima&amp;rsquo;s vibration diagnostic software, ExpertALERT for Voyager (EAV), recently saved Tri-State money by taking machines out of service for necessary repairs based on their condition instead of waiting until they fail, but it was the thorough dissemination of this information that helped make the program a success, according to Joe DeSoto, a results specialist at Tri-State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The DLI Diagnostic Data Collector includes EAV on a tablet-style computer platform that you can take out of the office,&amp;rdquo; says DeSoto. &amp;ldquo;It shows your maintenance people what&amp;rsquo;s happening to the machine in real time and helps explain where the problem is and why.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeSoto stresses that providing such information on the production floor is crucial to gaining the confidence of the maintenance staff. Showing them ExpertALERT&amp;rsquo;s diagnostic capabilities in action helped develop trust in the tool throughout the facility and boosted the credibility of the entire PdM program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All hardware products should use a common software and database platform, so they can pass along and process information seamlessly,&amp;rdquo; suggests Lofall. &amp;ldquo;However, establishing common lines of communication with the business system of any given plant is becoming just as important. This type of information-distribution is now expected in the very latest iterations of PdM software.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In essence, the latest PdM communication tools excel at &amp;ldquo;bringing the mountain to Mohammed&amp;rdquo; by abstracting data from insular condition monitoring applications, and then placing it at the feet of maintenance decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rsquo;s new networking technologies offer more power and transparency,&amp;rdquo; notes Lofall. &amp;ldquo;XML, OPC and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DCOM and .NET are breaking down the barriers of integration and distributed computing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, in conjunction with diagnostic software, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s online software permits facility managers to ascertain the status of wired machinery simply by logging onto their network to view real-time vibration data or obtain a complete diagnostic analysis. Under such topology, the online system is simply another node on the plant&amp;rsquo;s LAN. An Active-X component can even be installed on selected computers so that maintenance alert messages automatically pop-up on the screen. Additionally, electronic &amp;ldquo;in-trays&amp;rdquo; can be configured so that only the status of critical, process machines will be delivered to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Connectivity is a big part of making PdM pay for itself, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any good to have the information unless it gets to the right people,&amp;rdquo; says Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Certainly, the bulk of managers still get written reports, but now we have the technology to send results over the Internet and through electronic wireless connections like digital cell phones and pagers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taking things a step further, Azima DLI offers a unique means of distributing maintenance information by automatically generating machine status summaries in HTML, so that these pages can be accessed via a common Web browser. This allows a traveling engineer to determine machine status, even from outside the company WAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern PdM communication software also allows a significant amount of customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With today&amp;rsquo;s systems, you could get the condition of a machine right on your digital pager or cell phone with a text message,&amp;rdquo; adds Lofall. &amp;ldquo;Or, you could set it up so that your cell phone would ring every time a machine of your particular interest, reached a critical state of maintenance need. To go another step further, different ring tones can be assigned to different incoming numbers, so an engineer can immediately tell which piece of equipment needs attention. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a matter of preference.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These improvements in communication are even becoming available to small organizations that lack integrated business systems. Azima DLI, for instance, operates an online monitoring center on a 24/7 basis, providing worldwide coverage of wired machines. The monitoring program can be set up to deliver maintenance information over a wide range of time frames, from monthly reports all the way to immediate-alert messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	And so, the story of PdM has come a long way from the early days of RTF. Innovative PdM tools now help engineers accurately track the condition of their assets, whether they&amp;rsquo;re using a stand-alone PC system in a small job shop or an enterprise-wide system for a multi-plant industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DaimlerChrysler&amp;rsquo;s Kulczak summed up the modern state of affairs when he observed, &amp;ldquo;RTF is not only just a memory, but an impossibility here. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t afford to do that. For us, PdM software proved to be a very useful tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because today&amp;rsquo;s modern PdM systems enable increased uptime, energy savings, and reduced maintenance costs for organizations of all sizes, it has earned recognition as a contributor to profitability. Those plant engineers who have taken the next step from time-based or reactive drills to proactive condition-based planning on both existing and newequipment, are laying the groundwork for even further advances within the field of maintenance management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>When troubleshooting equipment, first impressions are important</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt1_rc.jpg" /&gt;When troubleshooting a machinery problem, whether for an unusual vibration problem or a component failure such as a bearing or seal, first impressions from the initial machinery inspection are very important. Any troubleshooting exercise should begin with a thorough investigation of machine history - process, design, operation, maintenance, and all available machine details. These first impressions are necessary to make sure the troubleshooting team is fully armed with important data and minimize the chances of a misdiagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people new to the troubleshooting process have a tendency to immediately pick up tools and start working. A better approach is to put the tools down and collect first impressions. While they might not immediately reveal the problem, they may identify a number of issues that are impacting overall reliability. Recommendations for these initial inspections include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/mt2_rc.jpg" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall cleanliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Good housekeeping often reveals that machinery maintenance practices are held to a higher standard. Look beyond dust to the condition of the base and foundation, piping supports, seal leaks, etc., for evidence of maintenance practices or environmental factors that negatively impact reliability. What are the expectations that a field repair can be conducted without introducing contaminants that will shorten the life of the replacement parts?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More detailed machine inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with the machine base and look for obvious signs of decay or improper anchoring. Move up to the feet and inspect the shims and hold-down bolts. Poor practices at the base often reveal a lack of quality of other repairs. Move to the shaft and drive (i.e., couplings, belts, etc.) and look for evidence of shaft damage, improper coupling assembly, and incorrect key length. While issues with these areas may not be the cause of the current problem, improvements made with the required repairs will improve machinery reliability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;If running, perform a basic vibration check:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a simple tool such as &lt;img src="http://image.exct.net/lib/fef91073706d05/m/1/OverhungBase_cropped_rc+copy.jpg" /&gt;coin with serrated edges to obtain an impression of relative machinery movement if the machine is still running. While vibration measurements tend to focus on the bearings, with coin in hand, start at the base and work up to the bearing locations to feel for unusual movement. Pay close attention to boundaries and connections such as the base-to-foundation, machine feet-to-base, and all piping and conduit. A simple condition such as a loose base-bolt can have a dramatic impact on the machine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Keep detailed notes of the initial impressions:&lt;/strong&gt; They will provide a comprehensive and professional report on improvements that will impact the life and reliability of the machine. While at the machine site, inspect other equipment in the area for similar issues and carefully present this information to the stakeholders. While no one likes to have their flaws revealed, a good presentation of steps that can be followed to positively impact machinery will be well received.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Machinery Health Monitor combines vibration and temperature monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management announces the addition of a unique temperature module for the CSI 6500 Machinery Health Monitor. The new A6630 temperature module complements the vibration monitoring capabilities already available in the CSI 6500 and delivers critical bearing temperature measurements. The A6630 module accepts RTD and thermocouple signals directly, reducing the installation cost and complexity of temperature monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether striving for uptime, machinery protection, or safety, temperature is an important parameter when monitoring critical turbomachinery, compressors and steam turbine generators. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		After overspeed, thrust is the most important protection measurement. When only two thrust position sensors are implemented, monitoring thrust bearing temperature provides an additional level of confidence for identifying early thrust bearing wear and machine malfunctions, and results in fewer missed trips.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In journal bearings, temperature measurements complement the radial vibration monitoring to help confirm bearing rubs and lube oil issues, allowing for scheduling of repairs during normally planned outages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;By simplifying the hardware for monitoring bearing temperature, more users are able to take advantage of these critical measurements,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Humes, general manager for Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Machinery Health Management business. &amp;ldquo;The combination of vibration and temperature monitoring enables plant personnel to make informed decisions that can increase the safety and profitability of their facility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In keeping with the API 670 specification, the A6630 has six or fewer channels per module, 4-20mA outputs, and includes relay logic for voting and automatic machine trips.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the CSI 6630 is hot swappable and supports the Easy Integration feature for fast connection to the DeltaV and Ovation process automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Emerson Process Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Emerson Process Management, an Emerson business, is a leader in helping businesses automate their production, processing and distribution in the chemical, oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, power, water and wastewater treatment, mining and metals, food and beverage, life sciences and other industries. The company combines superior products and technology with industry-specific engineering, consulting, project management and maintenance services.

            <title>The 5 biggest risks to effective asset management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to the PAS-551 standard on asset management from the British Standards Institute, asset management is defined as: &amp;ldquo;systematic and coordinated activities and practices through which an organization optimally and sustainably manages its assets and asset systems, their associated performance, risks and expenditures over their life cycles for the purpose of achieving its organizational strategic plan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Embodied in this definition, of course, are assets of various types (physical, financial, human, information and intangible), which all contribute to the organizational strategic plan. Best practices dictate that an Asset Management Plan, comprising of three main sub-plans (Operations, Maintenance and Risk) or its equivalent, be developed and implemented for physical assets. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The main focus of this article will be on physical assets, but you will find that some of the risks to asset management identified herein will be shared with the other asset type categories. The author suggests that there are at least five such risks that primarily contribute to an organization&amp;rsquo;s failure to optimally manage their assets: 1) not knowing what they have; 2) over- or under-maintenance; 3) improper operation; 4) improper risk management; and 5) suboptimized asset management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Not knowing what you have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In common manufacturing industry parlance, this is known as the FDH (fat, dumb and happy) approach to asset management. While it might seem intuitively obvious, many organizations either don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate the need to know with a high level of confidence, the assets that they have or they choose not to take the time to do so. Either way, this has to be the first major step taken towards ensuring that one&amp;rsquo;s asset management program is effective. Not knowing what one has is tantamount to playing a game of Russian roulette. If an organization is truly serious about their program they will need to take the following steps to establish the proper foundation to build upon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a list of all the organization&amp;rsquo;s assets and verify this list with what is in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish and configure a physical asset hierarchy. ISO 142242 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) can be used as reference.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop the criticality evaluation criteria for the business and apply to the verified asset base. This is where the individual assets are linked to how they affect the organizational strategic plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop and implement a management of change or configuration management process that will ensure that any future changes to the asset are properly evaluated and recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Over- or under-maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	During the operational phase of the asset life cycle, there can be a problem of over-maintaining as well as under-maintaining. The key issue regarding over-maintaining typically involves two issues that will make the asset management system ineffective. First, there is generally a significant cost associated with the execution of non-value-added maintenance. In this regard, cost can be loosely used as a guideline since there are well-documented industry benchmarks for maintenance spending that can be followed. Second, the typical organization that can be accused of over-maintaining its assets will most likely be performing intrusive maintenance tasks more frequently. From what we know of how typical failures manifest, this means that there will be additional exposure risk for the business to infant mortality failures and further incurred costs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The issue of under-maintenance and how it prevents effective asset management is even more clear-cut. Maintenance is often viewed as a business expense open to cutting like any other in order to maximize profits. With these pressures, maintenance departments are constantly struggling with how to balance cost with the performance requirements for the assets such as reliability and uptime. Cost-cutting often wins, however, in the form of delayed proactive maintenance as well as maintenance technicians lacking the necessary skills and tools to perform precise work.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With respect to both the issues of over- and under-maintenance, the author&amp;rsquo;s recommended approach is, starting with the most critical assets, determine the optimum maintenance requirements of the assets through one of the more rigorous methodologies such as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Then, load level the resources (financial and human) required to implement the maintenance plan. Finally, ensure that a training plan is in place to close the skills gap of the persons required for the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Improper operation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations suffer first of all from a lack of understanding of the inherent design capabilities of their assets and, secondly, how best to operate within their ranges to optimize the asset life cycle. For some assets, either operating below or above the design range adversely affects the life of the asset. A perfect example of this is the typical centrifugal process pump, as illustrated in the pump curve in Figure 1. Operating on either side of the best efficiency point on the curve is accompanied by a myriad of life-shortening issues. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we do when we choose to speed things up, slow things down or continuously operate assets that were designed to be intermittently run. The best guidance that the author can give with respect to this issue is to: 1) find out how your assets should be run; 2) understand the effects of operating outside of design ranges; and 3) if you can&amp;rsquo;t operate within the ranges, understand the risks or mitigate the risk (example: resize the impellor to match the operating point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Improper risk management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The basic tenet of best practices asset management dictates that a plan is implemented that not only manages the operation and maintenance of an organization&amp;rsquo;s assets, but also manages the risks associated with the ownership and use of the assets. Risk, in its most elementary form, is a function of consequences and the likelihood of such an event taking place. Risk management takes place on two major fronts: 1) assessment or identification; and 2) management and controls. Each area, when not done well, is a continued contributor to ineffective asset management. One doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to stretch the imagination too far to understand this concept. Perform a Google search on the &amp;ldquo;Bhopal Disaster&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, widely regarded as the world&amp;rsquo;s worst industrial catastrophe, for an example of unassessed and unmanaged risk. In order to fully manage risk, the author recommends that the following four step model, by ISO, be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish context&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk assessment: Risk identification, Risk analysis, Risk evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Risk treatment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor and review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Sub-optimized asset management systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In recent years, enterprise asset management (EAM) systems have become more popularly used within organizations to manage assets. Most systems have inherent deficiencies that prevent holistic management of all the required areas of the plan. As a result, additional secondary systems are often necessary. That being said, of the features that are available from most EAMs, many organizations are guilty of not fully utilizing them. This generally stems from shortcuts taken during the EAM implementation. The way to fully address this issue is to either do it right the first time or pay more to do it later. The author&amp;rsquo;s personal preference is the former. This takes planning, resources and treating the implementation as a major change program and not just a project. This is easier said than done, and is often best when supported by the services of change management professionals and asset infrastructure specialists. Apart from the tools (EAM, secondary systems) and technical solutions, we often fail to recognize that our human resources and business processes are important parts of an organization&amp;rsquo;s asset management system. A lack of due diligence in these areas will also negatively impact the bottom line and should be planned for as well.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Asset management is an integrated approach to optimizing the life cycle of your assets, beginning at conceptual design, through to usage, decommissioning and disposal. By acknowledging and paying attention to these five primary risks to effective asset management, you can put in place plans to mitigate the effects these might have on their program. Note also, that true excellence in asset management performance does not lie only in avoiding the pitfalls, but in turning each and every one of these opportunities to fail into an opportunity to excel.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How a Nucor mill benefits from condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last several years, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s integrated monitoring and diagnostics solution has been applied extensively at Nucor Steel&amp;rsquo;s Hickman Sheet Mill. Automated data collection has been introduced and applied in concert with established traditional manual condition monitoring programs at the mill. Data collected from both methods is interpreted and displayed via a single Web portal and diagnostics are performed remotely by Azima analysts. This article describes the justification, development, application and benefits of such an integrated solution. Specific case studies will be presented along with discussions of deployment issues and barriers that have been overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition Monitoring Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition monitoring, commonly referred to as predictive maintenance, is a proven approach to improving reliability and productivity in industry. Its underlying philosophy is that technology can be used to measure and evaluate the condition of plant assets and equipment, thus enabling intelligent decisions to be made about maintenance activity. In this manner, maintenance is applied to the assets that need attention, while those whose performance and condition are determined to be normal are left alone to perform productive roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The initial application of condition monitoring was in the utility and petrochemical industries in the 1970s. During this period, tremendous plant expansions and constructions were taking place, and plant scale increased dramatically. Instead of being dependent on many small machines, plant train size and capacity were such that a typical refinery or large generating plant became absolutely dependent on a very few, very large and very expensive capital machines. The loss of one of these capital assets (primarily rotating machinery) to mechanical failure could (and did) result in major income losses and, in the case of some the larger petrochemical plants, actual disruptions in markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This reality resulted in the development of fault protection systems (warning/trip systems based on vibration analysis) for protecting rotating capital machinery from catastrophic failure. These fault protection systems proved very successful in preventing crashes and limiting the damage from machine failure. These systems were soon institutionalized and standards (API, etc.) were developed and accepted throughout the appropriate industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the success of fault protection systems, many plant operators began to suspect that similar approaches could be applied to the myriad of smaller machines in the plant. Even though the failure of one of these smaller machines could not itself shut down a plant, the aggregate cost of repairs on these machines made the application of condition monitoring an attractive prospect in a typical refinery or chemical plant. However, the high per-machine cost of applying a fault protection system prohibited this from becoming a reality. Instead, technology responded with the development of portable measurement instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning with simple meters, manual log sheets and trending, machine surveillance programs were born. Beginning in the late 1980s, the explosion of PC/computer technology drove the development of computerized manual data collection systems which rapidly gained success in the plant maintenance market. In very short order, the use of &amp;ldquo;data collector&amp;rdquo; systems &amp;ndash; programmable black boxes with well-defined measurement capabilities &amp;ndash; spread to many industries, including the steel industry. A &amp;ldquo;route&amp;rdquo; defining the machines to be measured and the specific measurements to be taken was created in PC-based software and downloaded to the data collector. Personnel would go out into the plant to collect data with the device and then upload the data. This data would then be analyzed and a report was issued recommending appropriate maintenance actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the tremendous advances in data processing technology, these so-called &amp;ldquo;walk-around systems&amp;rdquo; have progressed to the point where the limit is no longer measurement technology. Megabytes of machine condition data can be gathered in a day, with relatively low skill requirements. This approach represents the status quo to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Contentional&amp;rsquo; Walk-around Data Collection &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Current data collector systems are very powerful and represent near-miraculous improvements over the initial 1980s systems. Modern data collectors are intended primarily to collect rotating machinery vibration data (although other scalar and non-dynamic data, including manual observations and comments can typically be entered). The accompanying software enables the presentation of the collected data for analysis. This software typically supports the incorporation of other external data, such as infrared thermography and lubricant analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical EAF/mini-mill environment, the actual execution and responsibility for such a walk-around vibration program resides either in-house or with outside contract resources. A typical AF/mini-mill with an associated cold mill may have 500 to 600 individual machines under monitoring/surveillance via data collector/walk-around methods, with somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 individual measurements being taken each month. This represents, under typical conditions, about one to two man-weeks of measurement effort alone. Data analysis typically consumes another man-week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s manual data collector systems have reached a near-zenith in efficiency. Early on (late 1980s), processing technology in microprocessors and memory limited their performance and, depending on the measurements to be taken, the technician analyst was often waiting for the data collector to do a given task. As such, his efficiency was limited. Processing technology today has advanced to the point where the required sample times and the fundamental mathematics of data digitization are the time limit, rather than the performance of hardware and software. It is not reasonable to expect any significant gains in terms of data collection time due to measurement technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a manual data collection program, achieving a load factor (time spent actually taking measurements as opposed to traveling from point to point, uploading and downloading data, etc.) of 60 to 70 percent is a significant achievement. It is not unusual for the data collection portion of a condition monitoring to consume 70 percent or more of recurring operating/labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is, of course, only part of the process of executing a successful condition monitoring program. Data analysis, screening processes and reporting are essential to achieving cost reductions and improvements in uptime. In most cases, the availability and skill of personnel with the proper experience and training are the governing factors in the success of a condition monitoring program. Collecting data is not hard; making the appropriate use of the data is much more difficult to achieve consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite very capable measurement technology, condition monitoring success in a given plant is still dependent on the ability to gather and correctly interpret data from the plant machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manual data collection processes, even in the presence of efficient data collection and skilled analysis, are still snapshot in nature and may not reflect the actual operating conditions that plant equipment experience. This is because there are more day-to-day variations in data than is revealed by a monthly collection route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historically, the steel industry has been willing to adopt condition monitoring as a means of improving mill productivity, and many successful programs are extant in mills. Whether contracted out or executed in-house, the same issues governing successful implementation of a condition monitoring program exist. The most difficult issue is retention of the appropriate skills and experience in the condition monitoring role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to be successful an individual must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be very conversant with rotating machinery and machine components &amp;ndash; the individual has to understand couplings, bearings and gears, machine dynamics (at least at some basic level), and the factors that affect machine wear and tear.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be at least conversant with (or be able and willing to be trained in) more esoteric concepts like spectrum analysis, frequency analysis, phase, modulation, etc., and have sufficient understanding of some basic concepts that normally are not part of the vocabulary of an individual with the requisite mechanical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be competent with computer technology, at least to the level of an advanced application user &amp;ndash; all of the current condition monitoring technologies involve computer usage to a very large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be a skilled communicator. Clearly explaining the reasoning behind a given recommendation is a key and often overlooked requirement for a successful condition monitoring program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be willing (or have personnel that are willing) to routinely do hot, dirty, repetitive data collection work, that typically involves difficult-to-access or hazardous areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not hard to understand why maintaining the appropriate people resources, whether in-house or contracted out, is difficult to achieve over the long haul. In the developing years of condition monitoring technology (late 1970s to early 1990s), most plants, regardless of size, had one or two (sometimes many more) resources devoted to condition monitoring programs. This supply led to an effective &amp;ldquo;farm club&amp;rdquo; system that supplied experienced personnel to both the in-the-plant programs and outside contract/consultant sources. Changes in plant manning, personnel and position rotations, and retirements have resulted in a situation where the availability of such personnel is limited and shrinking, and the cost of those workers is rising. The decline in the availability of human resources with the appropriate experience and skill sets has led to the exploration of ways to bring the data to the analyst. In this manner, a person with the requisite skills can cover far more industrial real estate than would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Remove Monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the late 1970s, adoption of automation for plant and process control and communication has risen substantially both in complexity and market acceptance. Computers on every desk and in every control room are now the norm. Mills and plants typically have very sophisticated and extensive IT networks for both administrative and process control/automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First approaches in many diverse industries involved transmission of machine-condition-related data to existing Man-Machine Interface (MMI)/Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems. Particularly, existing machinery protection (warning and trip) systems were tied into control room HMI/MMI interfaces so that operators could view vibration, temperature and other machine condition parameters. Typically, these were magnitude-only scalar values, which &amp;ndash; while valuable in terms of information and indication of possible machine problems &amp;ndash; were lacking in terms of trending, analysis and data interpretation capabilities. Plant personnel were thus receiving information that a given machine was vibrating more, or a bearing temperature was going up, etc. This left open the question of why these changes were occurring, and how the plant should react to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advances in technology, the Internet and the need to more efficiently monitor machinery with limited personnel drove the development of expanded remote monitoring systems. Rather than delivering machine data in-house only (to the control room, etc.), technology and the Internet enable information to be accessed from anywhere, anytime. This new method uses field-mounted sensing devices and instruments, some sort of aggregating devices, advanced software, and access to plant and external networks for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits of such a system are apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More frequent monitoring of machinery without a need for data collection/analysis personnel to be present, as well as the ability to observe dynamic changes in machine condition due to load, speed and operating conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to move data off-site for remote consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to have multiple resources in multiple locations looking at data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to monitor parameters other than what would normally be monitored in a traditional manual program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to assess machine performance in terms of efficiency, throughput, etc., and relate that data to machine condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Condition Monitoring at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman has had a condition monitoring program in place for more than 10 years. The program was based around traditional manual survey methodology and techniques, and was provided by outside contract resources. Data was collected on equipment across the mill on a monthly basis, with frequent callouts for troubleshooting and analysis of specific problems. After data collection, analysis was performed and written reports with recommendations were disseminated to appropriate mill personnel. All systems in the mill (environmental, hot mill, casters and melt shop) were included. In 1998, Nucor Hickman added a cold mill facility, with pickling line, galvanizing line, RT mill and annealing capability. The traditional monitoring program was expanded (nearly doubled) to include this portion of the mill. After the integration of the cold mill into the program, 590 machines were under monthly surveillance. A typical survey required two to three man-weeks to complete by manual methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As early forms of remote data collection and analysis methods became available, opportunities rose where remote monitoring might be practical and beneficial. In the first case, caster mold water cooling pumps, which had traditionally been a maintenance problem, became a potential application due to changes in operating conditions. The mold water pump installation at Nucor Hickman at that point consisted of three 700-horsepower opposed suction centrifugal pumps, direct coupled to induction motor drivers. In typical operations, two pumps were in service and one maintained as in inline spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operational requirements dictated a need for increased mold water flow, and all three pumps were placed in service. This had a negative impact in terms of pump vibration levels and reduced confidence in pump reliability. There was no remaining spare capacity (the standby pump was now in continuous service), making the impact of a pump failure significant. Nucor Hickman decided to apply some of the early remote, Internet-based monitoring technologies to the pumps. Expected benefits were closer-to-real-time problem detection and better understanding of the pumps&amp;rsquo; vibration behavior. In addition, a current sensor was added to the systems on each motor, which would allow monitoring of system load in parallel with pump and motor vibration on each of the pumps. The system would report bearing temperatures, vibration magnitudes, discharge pressures, current magnitudes and frequency content/time domain vibration data from each pump. This data was available to contractor analysis personnel, who were responsible for monitoring the pumps&amp;rsquo; behavior, and also to plant personnel. In addition, the data was available over the Web, making it accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection. Multiple users could access the system at the same time from multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Internet-based monitoring system was installed with data being collected much more frequently and under different operational conditions. Within days of commissioning the online remote system, it was obvious that the vibration behavior of the pumps varied much more widely than had been indicated by the once-per-month data. This is because monthly data &amp;ndash; even several years worth of it &amp;ndash; was simply insufficient to notice it. The frequent collection enabled by the automated system clearly showed 3:1 variations over different operational modes. In addition, load current data (which was not available from the traditional once/month data) indicated that the pumps were typically not loaded nearly to capacity, and were operating well off curve. As a result, an engineering study of the pump systems and operation was commissioned. The study concluded that sizing errors, control strategies and piping configurations were incorrect for the desired operating conditions. The pumps were resized and other changes were put in place to provide the desired increased flow. This provided spare capacity without the need to run all three pumps, and contributed materially to improved cooling and mold life. It is highly unlikely that these issues would have come to light without the data provided by the remote monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further applications of remote monitoring technology were installed on baghouse ID fans and utility air compressors in the hot mill. The hot mill air compressors are three-stage centrifugal machines, directly driven by two-pole induction motors. The compressors and motors were on monthly surveillance and were subject to frequent bearing failures in the drive motors. Once-per-month data was catching bearing failures often, but trends were erratic and no clear root cause was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When remote monitoring technology was applied, it became clear that &amp;ndash; as with the mold water pumps &amp;ndash; the vibration levels were varying much more than had been apparent from the monthly manual data. It was also clear that the variations had a pattern that closely tracked ambient temperatures. Since bearing temperatures also were being monitored, it was clear that when ambient temperature went up, vibration levels increased dramatically. Analysis of the frequency content provided by the remote monitoring system clearly indicated that the cause of the increase in vibration was imbalance in the motor rotors. Further review of bearing wear patterns indicated an extreme thrust load was being placed on the motor&amp;rsquo;s radial Conrad-type ball bearings. From this, it became apparent that at high temperatures the motor rotor was expanding axially and there was insufficient clearance in the motor bearing fits to allow for this expansion, causing rotor bow (hence the imbalance) and axial overload of the motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of this discovery, the compressor drive motors were replaced with an alternate design. Vibration levels, as reported by the remote monitoring system, remained low and reliability dramatically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the cold mill at Hickman, the RT mill stand drives were equipped with four 5,000 HP synchronous motors. The motors were journal bearing machines and were not reliable. Thrusting and resultant bearing failures, along with pole piece electrical failures, led to the 2004 installation of a warning and trip system based on proximity probes on the motors and accelerometers on the mill gearboxes. This system not only supplied warning and trip capability, but also provided near real-time vibration data, including shaft orbits, to analysis personnel outside the mill. Remote analysis personnel could be hundreds of miles away, viewing near-real-time data, and consulting directly with pulpit operators on problems with the mill stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these and other successes, it was clear that remote machinery monitoring offered improvements and capabilities not provided by conventional means. However, this early system did have limitations. It relied on serial RS-485 communications with a scanner/site server. As the system expanded, sampling rates slowed down and the most recent data was not available in a timely fashion. It also used proprietary sensors, which limited configurability and flexibility of application. The system on the RT mill, while powerful, was expensive and was limited to one user at a time due to its use of VPN technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in late 2004 and early 2005, Nucor Hickman undertook deployment of wireless technology in the mill. The justification was shipping and inventory applications, cranes and systems in the hot mill, and to meet other operational requirements. At the same time, improved remote monitoring technology was coming on the market using the same wireless protocols. This new remote monitoring technology, developed by Azima DLI, used commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, standard networking protocols, and was much more flexible in terms of software and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The convergence of wireless technology, its application in the mill, and the availability of improved technology all drove expansion of Nucor Hickman&amp;rsquo;s remote equipment monitoring. It is interesting to note that the wireless implementation and deployment was justified by other applications within the mill. The impact of the machinery monitoring data on the network has been minimal, and even with the extensive deployment at Nucor Hickman, represents a tiny fraction of network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nucor Hickman: Largest Remote Monitoring Deployment in the U.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As of the publication of this article, the Nucor Hickman Sheet Mill was the site of the largest dynamic signal remote monitoring deployment in the United States. Azima remote monitoring technology is used on all mill cooling towers, all baghouse ID fans, all baghouse reverse air fans, caster mold water pumps, caster spray water pumps, all descale pumps, roof feed flux system aspiration fans, and mill air compressors. Remote monitoring system installation is underway on mill emergency generator sets, and is planned for the near future shape tension rolls in the cold mill. Approximately 280 sensors are remotely monitored. Mill personnel have full access to data, alert histories, alarms and warnings, reports and report/machine histories. Alerts are transmitted by e-mail and/or cell phone SMS text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system currently applied at Nucor Hickman communicates through the plant network either via 802.11b wireless technology or via standard Ethernet (unlike earlier systems, which required serial RS-485 communication). A single small site server (standard PC) is located at the plant to act as a data gateway and buffering device. If connectivity out of the mill is lost, the site server acts as a data storage device buffering data until connectivity is restored. One of the key features is that the monitoring application requires no software on the target client PC &amp;ndash; all that is required is Internet access and a login for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of sensors mounted on the target machine and a sensor hub that digitizes and aggregates data from the sensors. Collected data is transmitted securely to the plant network via either 802.11b wireless or Ethernet. (Note that, although not currently employed at Nucor Hickman, the system also supports data transmission via a cellular interface, independent of the plant network.)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. How the Azima DLI Remote Monitoring System Works at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data is sent via the plant network to the local site server and then out over the Internet to Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s remote servers. Plant personnel, analysts or other authorized parties can then access the system via a secure Web portal. Access and privileges are controlled by double password, and depending on privileges, a user can have rights to view data, edit system settings, analyze data and/or issue reports. All data, alerts and alert histories, and reports generated by analysts are maintained on the Web portal. Histories of reports generated can be sorted and searched by plant area, date, machine, fault type and other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the number of remotely monitored machines continues to expand at Nucor Hickman, many less critical machines remain under manual surveillance by operators on rounds once a month. These machines include those in the balance of plant (hydraulic pumps, roll stand cooling pumps, furnace cooling pumps, and so forth). This monthly data is fed into the Azima DLI system and displayed via the same secure Web interface as the remotely collected data. This means that a mill-wide view of equipment health &amp;ndash; from all monitored machines, regardless of collection method &amp;ndash; is visible via a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima analysts are responsible for monitoring and analyzing all posted to the Web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Involved in Getting Remote Monitoring Started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the most attractive features of the remote monitoring system at Hickman is that it is comprised primarily of low-cost, commercially available components (for example, COTS sensors) combined with advanced software and specialized sensor hubs. Careful planning and forethought is needed to ensure a successful remote monitoring deployment. Some of the lessons learned include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Careful thought should be given as to which machines are to be monitored and in what manner. In the case of Hickman, although the condition monitoring contractor had overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the system, and for disseminating the analysis and results there from, each individual mill area had to decide what was to be monitored and how. Reporting relationships, access and other issues were all discussed and defined well ahead of the installation of monitoring equipment. There was a clear list of which equipment would benefit from automated remote monitoring and which could be sufficiently monitored by conventional methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of points per machine to be monitored is an important consideration. Simply mimicking what would have been done in a manual monitoring program (multiple points and measurements per bearing) is usually unnecessary and adds cost while delivering small incremental value.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If wireless transmission is to be employed, determine the best protocol for the site: 802.11b/g, ZigBee, or 900 megahertz. In the case of Hickman, 802.11b was the preferred choice and that has been universally true in other applications as well. It offers the widest selection of available devices, and can cover a wide area with just a few access points. The 802.11b protocol has proven to be very reliable and is immune to RF interference, even in the melt shop area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve IT early. Agreement needs to be reached on security, protocols, etc. well before the installation of a remote monitoring system. What are the mill&amp;rsquo;s security expectations and policies? Within the plant, is traditional Local Area Network (LAN) acceptable, or is a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) necessary? IT support during deployment is crucial to successful and efficient startup. Connectivity must be verified, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Remote Monitoring Benefits Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The initial deployment of the current generation of remote machinery monitoring technology commenced in July 2005. The installation and commissioning of Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring system is continuing to expand. The hybrid approach of monitoring critical machines in parallel with traditional manual walk-around monitoring of balance-of-plant equipment, all reported via a common Web-based portal, has provided solid value to Nucor Hickman personnel. Several case studies demonstrating this value are briefly detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 1: Failure Caught Without Site Visit or Increased Costs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the spring of 2006, a 1,500 HP baghouse fan induction motor failed due to a sudden stator short failure. All of the baghouse fans were equipped with remote monitoring hubs and were under surveillance. The motor was replaced with a rebuilt spare. Immediately on restart of the fan, much higher vibration levels were noted by the remote monitoring analyst (who was not on site). Mill environmental department personnel, who were responsible for the baghouse and its equipment, were notified of the increased vibration. Further examination of the data identified the problem as an outer race defect on the inboard (drive end) bearing of the motor. Mill personnel requested an evaluation as to the likelihood of the motor continuing in service until the next maintenance outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analysis of the data and the rate of change indicated that it was likely that the unit would indeed continue to run. In an attempt to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, attempts at relubrication of the motor bearing were undertaken. Unfortunately, the relubrication actually increased the vibration, and the rate of deterioration increased dramatically. Mill personnel were advised of the change, and monitoring surveillance increased (frequency of data collection can be increased remotely via the Azima system&amp;rsquo;s interface). The unit continued to deteriorate and, by the weekend, had reached a stage wherein continued operation was questionable. A recommendation was made to remove the unit from service at the first opportunity. After mutual viewing of the data and trends by plant personnel in conference with the remote analyst, plant personnel decided to remove the unit from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A spare fan was placed in service while the motor replacement was undertaken. The spare fan also was equipped with sensors that reported to the Azima system. Prior to beginning disassembly of the failed fan, the spare was restarted and vibration and performance data was reviewed by the remote analyst, who confirmed that the spare fan was running well and could be expected to give reliable service while the failed fan was repaired. Only after the confirmation of the health of the spare was the failed fan removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that at no time during this episode was the equipment analyst on site at the mill. Problem detection, confirmation of the problem and diagnostics (including the condition assessment of the spare fan) were all conducted remotely with no site visits and no costs incurred. In the case of the confirmation of the condition of the spare fan, the contractor analyst was in an airport hundreds of miles away and was still able to serve the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unlikely that this level of detection, service and continued operation could have been achieved with conventional once/month survey method. Using conventional methods, it is likely that several site visits would have been required with extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/394552f5-f4a2-4740-b552-559d87eacac7_Nucor Hickman_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Trend Graph Showing Vibration Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 2: Air Compressor Runs the Last Mile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A centrifugal induction motor-driven air compressor had suffered from poor reliability for some time. Beginning in the spring of 2006, it was equipped with remote monitoring technology. Immediately upon installation of the system, dramatic variations in motor vibration level with compressor load were noted. Remotely acquired and analyzed vibration data indicated that bearing fits were in poor condition, and that the spacer gear coupling associated with this compressor was partially locked up. A recommendation was made to not yet remove the unit from service, but rather to continue to run and monitor it while preparations for a repair were made. Data also was provided to the motor repair vendor. The motor repair vendor concurred that the vibration data indicated a problem but that it was likely confined to the coupling. The recommendation was made by the motor repair vendor to disconnect the coupling, run the motor solo, and take manual measurements to confirm the coupling problem. The coupling was disconnected, the motor was run solo and manual vibration measurements were undertaken. The motor was actually worse in the uncoupled condition, and before the vibration measurements could be completed, the motor failed catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the motor repair was completed and the unit returned to service, the remote monitoring system was recommissioned and was able to confirm that the motor and compressor were in good condition and suitable for continued service. This condition persisted for several months, with the unit running well and remote monitoring continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, following a mill outage, the compressor motor vibration exhibited a small but unmistakable increase in overall vibration on the motor. The melt shop personnel were notified and the recommendation was made to continue to run the compressor. Monitoring frequency was increased and alert thresholds adjusted to compensate for the changes. No site visits were required and the increased monitoring and adjustments were accomplished remotely via the system&amp;rsquo;s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few weeks later, the adjusted alert levels were exceeded, and automated alerts were issued. No other changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few more weeks, the steady trend upward in motor vibration continued. Plant personnel were continuously advised as to the deteriorating condition of the unit, as was the motor repair vendor. Finally, the deterioration reached a level where the remote analyst recommended removing the unit from service at the convenient opportunity. The motor repair vendor sent personnel to the site to take manual vibration measurements on the motor. The manual measurements confirmed the problem and the unit was removed from service and sent out for repair. A coupling issue and deterioration of the inboard motor bearing was confirmed. Again, no site visits by analysis personnel were required and the plant was able to &amp;ldquo;run the unit the last mile&amp;rdquo; without incurring catastrophic failure or mill outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/46d29376-fd1c-4a99-999f-5fa8c7feb97e_Nucor Hickman_3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 3: Remote Monitoring Enables System-Wide Process Optimization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A remote monitoring system can, as in the cases above, greatly expand on the capabilities of conventional rotating machinery vibration analysis. What many do not realize is that remote monitoring technology can also contribute in ways that are not possible with conventional manual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The baghouse fans at NUCOR Hickman are vital to the plant. Maintenance of plant productivity, while still staying within permitted emission limits, is essential to plant profitability. Operating costs (in terms of power consumption) for several thousand horsepower of fan drives is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring system, as applied to the baghouse fans at Hickman, incorporates vibration measurements along with load current measurements. Sampling rates are very rapid, and the baghouse fans at Hickman have an essentially unity power factor. The fan motors are not individually metered at the MCCs. With the rapid sampling of the remote monitoring system, however, it became possible to get a reasonably accurate measure of fan load and operating cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after commissioning the baghouse fan remote monitoring system, is was seen that variations in fan load and fan vibration were, not surprisingly, directly related to tap-to-tap cycles of the EAFs. All of the fans take suction from a common plenum, which is in turn fed by the furnace and canopy ducts. Data collected by the remote monitoring system allowed observation of the dynamics of fan load as the melt shop underwent normal operation cycles. The ability to average and integrate the load data unexpectedly revealed that significant variation in fan HP load existed not only during furnace cycles but from one fan to another. The data indicated a several-thousand-dollars-per-month variation in the operating cost of the fans. After data review, it became apparent that there was significant temperature (and thus density and mass flow) variation from one fan to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The variation in load was confirmed by temperature measurements and infrared thermographic observation of the change in duct temperatures over time. Poor distribution in the plenum has been partially corrected by installing turning vanes in the plenum and adjusting damper control strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material improvements in fan efficiency have been realized as a result of these actions. The remote monitoring system allowed quantification of these issues and the ability to directly measure the effects of corrective action. This would not have been possible with conventional machinery monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman is embracing new remote monitoring technologies and integrating them with its existing manual data collection process. By determining the most effective monitoring method for each machine &amp;ndash; based on level of criticality, history of problems, and so forth &amp;ndash; Nucor has established a comprehensive monitoring program that delivers increased uptime, reduced safety risks, and lower maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By choosing the Azima DLI monitoring and diagnostics system, Nucor has installed a flexible system that supports the integration of data collected both by automated system and manual rounds. All data is presented via a single, secure Web interface. This enables mill-wide alerts to potential problems and delivers critical data to remotely located Azima analysts for review, analysis and advice. In addition to providing more comprehensive monitoring, Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring solution has reduced the demand on existing resources at Nucor Hickman and frees them up to focus on maintenance rather than data collection. The program has been successful to date at Hickman, with clear successes and benefits, and further expansion is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As with most technological pursuits the real reason for success is people. We wish to offer sincerest thanks to the team at Nucor Hickman. The manager of the environmental department, Wayne Turney, and the department supervisor, Dan Bullock, have been particularly instrumental in the ongoing implementation. Dave DaVolt, Rod Wycoff, Claude Riggin, Justin Smith, Ashley Tippet, Tom Wright and Lou Incrocci in the hot mill, cold mill and melt shop have all contributed to the successful demonstration of these technologies. Likewise, success would have been impossible without the support, expert advice and consultation from the Nucor Hickman IT group. Rudy Moser, department manager, and Jim Walmsley, network support, were essential in making the implementation a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the part of Azima DLI, Dr. Ed Futcher and his development team created the tools to make the systems possible, and Heather De Jes&amp;uacute;s and Dave Geswein, Azima engineering, deployed the system at the mill. Nelson A. Baxter, vice president of diagnostics for Azima, was invaluable in technical support and expertise. Elsa Anzalone, account manager for Azima, made the case for what has been achieved in this project, and her contributions have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Programs help Harrison Steel improve energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When Harrison Steel Casting Company made the decision to advance its energy-efficiency efforts, the company took stock of the resources available to industry and made a strategic decision to partner with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;rsquo;s (EPA) Energy Star program and the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) Save Energy Now LEADER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel joined both of these programs because it allows the company to take advantage of the multitude of resources available from both Energy Star and the Save Energy Now LEADER programs. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s participation in both programs serves as an example that can be followed by other industrial companies interested in making improvements in energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Harrison Steel discovered, the programs differ in their scope and resources to provide complementary resources for industry. Where Energy Star focuses on assisting companies in establishing effective energy management teams and corporate energy management programs, Save Energy Now LEADER offers technical expertise and assistance for successfully implementing efficiency improvements to industrial systems and processes. Industrial companies that are interested in reducing energy consumption and the associated costs should examine the results that Harrison Steel has realized by partnering with both the Save Energy Now and Energy Star programs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/7fde0248-bbd8-45a3-bcf6-cd34938fc7cd_Harrison.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Harrison Steel energy manager Jeremy Allyn points to 2006 as the year that Harrison Steel began a clear commitment to energy reduction; that was the year when the company received an energy audit from Jack Staley of Balance Engineering. The audit produced a fairly extensive list of energy conservation measures. Although Harrison Steel did pursue some of the recommendations, the true value of that initial audit was opening the eyes of the company&amp;rsquo;s leaders and plant staff to the potential of realizing cost savings through the implementation of energy-efficiency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saving Energy to Improve the Bottom Line &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Energy costs at Harrison Steel typically constitute 5 to 8 percent of sales. In 2008, the company was operating at full capacity, and it spent approximately $5 million on electricity and $4 million on natural gas. However, it should be noted that Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s natural gas costs were slightly above average that year due to the higher-than-normal prices at the time. The company&amp;rsquo;s electricity prices in 2008 were 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) with approximately 73.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of usage that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008, the average operating profit for steel foundries with more than $25 million in annual sales, such as Harrison Steel, was 6.6 percent of sales. This slim profit margin is typical for steel foundries, and reducing operating costs through energy savings can help increase that margin and provide a competitive edge. Because rising energy costs can negatively affect profits, Harrison Steel understood that every dollar saved on energy spending would go directly to the bottom line. Additionally, the company understood that energy efficiency measures could have a more immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a company with a profit margin similar to Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s that cuts energy spending by $66,000 through efficiency measures like lighting or stopping air leaks would have to increase its total sales by $1 million to achieve the same financial impact. Also, an energy-efficiency project is a constant source of savings that a company can continue to experience year after year, while increasing sales volume on a constant basis is much more difficult. Harrison Steel understands these business-side benefits associated with capturing energy savings, in addition to the benefits that increased energy efficiency has for the environment. In fact, the company has even considered creating a different &amp;ndash; and higher &amp;ndash; internal rate of return (IRR) for energy projects since they include positive externalities and dependable, consistent savings. Nonetheless, even with using the same IRR as for other projects in the company, Harrison Steel has been able to identify and complete projects with high enough savings to justify implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initiating Energy Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The 2006 energy audit helped Harrison Steel to realize the potential savings that were available by upgrading equipment and improving production processes to increase efficiency. The company began to undertake projects with promising energy cost savings based on the audit recommendations. One such project involved an upgrade to the natural gas burners used for preheating ladles that hold molten metal. The burners were old and obsolete, using a less-than-optimal air and gas mixture and producing a poor flame shape. Harrison Steel chose to implement this project because of its capacity to reduce operating expenses while only costing approximately $17,500 to implement. The estimated energy savings from the improved burners is an impressive $73,857 per year, which means the repayment period for this project was less than three months. To achieve the same annual affect on the bottom line through increased sales, Harrison Steel would have had to generate an additional $1,119,045 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since that initial implementation, Harrison Steel has continued to make progress, including activities undertaken during the company&amp;rsquo;s 2009 Christmas shutdown. Allyn took advantage of the unusually quiet plant to perform his own assessment to locate air leaks. A single 1/16-inch diameter air leak in a compressed air system at 100 pounds per square inch (psi) loses air at 6.5 cubic feet per minute. At a $.06 per kWh rate, based on 24-hour-a-day operation, such leaks can result in added costs of $633 per year. Equipped with nothing but the naked ear, Allyn was able to locate around 100 air leaks. Harrison Steel uses approximately 5,000 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) of compressed air &amp;ndash; or 2.6 billion standard cubic feet (SCF) annually &amp;ndash; with the largest end-use being the pneumatic transportation of sand for making molds. Fixing those air leaks identified by Allyn was believed to have produced approximately $15,000 in annual energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another project identified in the 2006 energy audit that Harrison Steel is currently implementing is a variable speed drives project for its well pumps. This upgrade will allow the company to actually slow down the pumps to control the plant&amp;rsquo;s water pressure rather than using demand valves to throttle the pressure while the machine is running at full speed. This variable speed drives upgrade will cost $25,000 to implement and will save the company approximately $16,800 per year in electricity costs &amp;ndash; a payback period of less than 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the fall of 2009, Harrison Steel began its partnership with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star for Industry program, a voluntary government partnership program aimed at helping companies develop and improve energy management programs. Harrison Steel became aware of Energy Star through its work in the Energy Star Focus on Energy Efficiency in the metalcasting industry. The Energy Star program offers guidance to its partners focused on strengthening energy management and establishing corporate energy programs and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In making the decision to partner with EPA, Harrison Steel was particularly attracted to the idea of associating the company with the popular Energy Star brand, a national symbol of energy efficiency and environmental protection. Harrison Steel saw joining the Energy Star program as a way of building a sustainable energy management framework for its energy efforts, making them more personal to employees, not just a list of engineering items to complete. The program also provided Harrison Steel access to a network of companies undertaking similar efforts. Under the program, a Strategic Energy Advisor (SEA) was assigned to Harrison Steel; that SEA is now working with the company to help it build an Energy Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, Harrison Steel has experienced two main benefits from partnering with Energy Star. First, the company has been able to interact one-on-one with its SEA in order to learn from the experiences of other companies in establishing an Energy Team. Second, the company has gained valuable insights from Web conferences that offer the opportunity to network with and learn from other professionals involved in energy management at organizations with similar goals and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to Energy Star&amp;rsquo;s partnership for industry, Harrison Steel also values Energy Star as a resource for improving building envelope systems. Energy Star has resources for energy management in buildings such as office and warehouse facilities. For example, the 2006 energy audit had a recommendation for Harrison Steel to upgrade lighting within certain storage and office buildings. Although Harrison Steel had this report for years, it was unable to implement the recommendation until Energy Star assisted in the formation of the Harrison Steel Energy Team. This team has been able to focus on moving ahead with such projects, and Harrison Steel has now approved a lighting project costing around $10,000 for one of the company&amp;rsquo;s storage facilities. This project will install more efficient lighting in the storage facility, as well as use motion sensor lighting controls, which will compound the cost savings by automatically turning off lights when no one is in certain parts of the building. The lighting upgrade is expected to save the company between $2,500 and $4,500 per year in electricity costs, the equivalent of increasing annual sales by $38,000 to $68,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to partnering with the EPA, Harrison Steel decided in the spring of 2010 to partner with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER initiative. The company quickly recognized the added value that Save Energy Now offered. Once the company began looking at the Save Energy Now resources online, it realized that ITP offers technical expertise and engineering applied to industrial energy. Harrison Steel appreciated Save Energy Now&amp;rsquo;s technical tools that could be applied to the company&amp;rsquo;s systems. This DOE expertise compliments the work the company had begun with Energy Star. Harrison Steel decided it should also join the Save Energy Now LEADER initiative after recognizing ITP&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise in industrial systems, which are in-depth and detail-specific to industrial processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel immediately benefitted from Save Energy Now through the use of the initiative Web site materials like information on improving energy efficiency through upgrading existing standard belts to newer V-belts for belt-driven equipment, such as fans. Standard belts are approximately 95 percent efficient in transferring mechanical energy, but the V-belts improve efficiency by an additional 2 percent since they require less energy to bend and do not slip. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s energy team also utilized ITP&amp;rsquo;s online materials to gain insight and instruction that may allow the company to implement a new project dealing with combustion efficiency of heat treatment furnaces. This project would focus on controlling the oxygen level, making sure there is not too much air in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example for Other Industrial Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The complementary nature of the resources provided by the Energy Star and Save Energy Now initiatives is an important take-away concept for other industrial companies interested in advancing energy management programs. As Allyn noted, where Energy Star for Industry shines in terms of its energy management resources, including energy team support and motivating brand, Save Energy Now brings the engineering tools needed to achieve implementation. Companies partnering with both programs will find themselves equipped with the full spectrum of tools needed to plan and achieve energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Wireless technology helps boost production, cut costs at Tecpetrol</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management&amp;rsquo;s Smart Wireless technology, based on the IEC 62591 (WirelessHART) standard, is enabling Tecpetrol to boost production while reducing maintenance and operations costs at natural gas compression and delivery facilities in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With better information for improved measurement and control we have been able to produce an additional $4 million in natural gas, cut our maintenance costs by 62 percent, and reduce our supervisory control costs by 35 percent,&amp;rdquo; said Odin Fern&amp;aacute;ndez, Tecpetrol production manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tecpetrol began using Smart Wireless in early 2009 to track gas venting, comply with environmental regulations, measure gas sold to third parties, and perform AGA3 calculations needed for economic balance of its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, the company installed Emerson&amp;rsquo;s Rosemount wireless pressure, DP, and temperature transmitters at wellheads in its Campo Duran field. Smart Wireless Gateways collect the real-time data and deliver it to the company&amp;rsquo;s DeltaV digital automation system. A Daniel ultrasonic flow meter installed for custody transfer measurements also allows Tecpetrol to cross-check the wireless data for quality control, while a ROC flow computer monitors remote points of the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After seeing the benefits of this initial installation, Tecpetrol added a similar wireless network to its Aguarague Field. Both installations enabled the company to enhance control and productivity. They now have access to data that was not available before, or that had to be checked manually by staff reading local gauges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Employee safety has been improved. We&amp;rsquo;ve cut our trips to the field by 15 percent and reduced human error,&amp;rdquo; Fern&amp;aacute;ndez said. &amp;ldquo;The operators can obtain diagnostics and check on plant processes remotely, which helps them better manage their time and work more efficiently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Installation costs for Smart Wireless were also $120,000 less than for a wired solution. A wired network would have been very difficult to install because the areas monitored are densely packed with piping and rotating equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Smart Wireless devices were easy to install and everything was up and running within a day,&amp;rdquo; Fern&amp;aacute;ndez said. &amp;ldquo;The network has been operating smoothly ever since.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company is currently planning to expand its use of wireless technology to additional facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Emerson Process Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Emerson Process Management, an Emerson business, is a leader in helping businesses automate their production, processing and distribution in the chemical, oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, power, water and wastewater treatment, mining and metals, food and beverage, life sciences and other industries. The company combines superior products and technology with industry-specific engineering, consulting, project management and maintenance services.

            <title>Using vibration analysis to test for bearing wear</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This article discusses an example of an outer race-bearing defect on a 1,250-ton (4,400-kilowatt) air-conditioning chiller. The defect was detected using off-the-shelf portable vibration analysis hardware and software. The machine is a single-stage centrifugal compressor with a rolling element thrust bearing on the motor free end and a sleeve bearing on the motor drive end. This article discusses methods used to diagnose and trend the bearing defect using vibration spectra as an indicator of the bearing condition. The diagnostic methods covered are universally applicable to other types of machines (pumps, fans, gears) with rolling contact bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis Tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tools used to measure vibration have improved significantly in the past 25 years. The sensor of choice for most vibration data collection on industrial machinery is an accelerometer. As the name implies, the output is proportional to acceleration; however, it is normally integrated to display in units of velocity. All data shown in this case history was collected using a triaxial accelerometer cluster shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/32a4ba93-28b7-4c13-bece-0e067afea934_bearing1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Chiller showing the vibration test location on the motor bearing housings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/d80b5c95-094a-40b9-b1da-1f589f348625_bearing2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Sketch of a triaxial accelerometer cluster (left) that is stud-mounted to the bronze disk mounting pad (bottom right). The cluster contains three accelerometers, each mutually perpendicular to the others. Vibration data collection is activated using a bar code that automatically sets up the data collector, collects and then stores the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The notched mounting pad is adhered rigidly to the motor bearing housing, and the triaxial cluster is stud-mounted, allowing all three axes to be collected simultaneously. The bar code and mounting configuration allow accurate and repeatable data to be collected every time, regardless of the skill of the person doing the data collection. As long as the test conditions are relatively consistent, the test data also should be consistent if the mechanical condition remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The signal processing techniques used by a vibration analyst vary based on the level of detail desired. In routine predictive maintenance programs, two types of data typically are collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Overall level: &lt;/strong&gt;The overall level is a measure of the total vibration amplitude over a wide range of frequencies. An overall vibration measurement, also called a broadband level, is a single value that is relatively easy and cheap to collect, process, analyze and trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Narrowband: &lt;/strong&gt;Using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the vibration signal is resolved into a number of discrete frequencies and displayed as a two-dimensional spectral plot of amplitude vs. frequency. All of the triaxial spectra shown in this case history have a frequency scale with 800 lines of resolution. In other words, each spectrum is composed of 800 individual peaks defining an amplitude at a specific frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Acceptance Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is an acceptable level of vibration for the 1,250-ton (4400-kW) chiller? The chiller manufacturer uses a pass/fail broadband specification of 0.25 inches/second (peak). Vibration tolerances or specifications typically are expressed as either absolute or relative criteria. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart, summarized in Table 1, is the most common example of absolute criteria and is a good guide for engineers who do not have any historical data on a machine. Each increment of machinery condition is represented by change of a factor of two in the vibration velocity. A third column provides an easy conversion between inches/second (peak) and the commonly used logarithmic unit of velocity decibels (VdB). Note that 6 dB also represents a change by a factor of two, so each machinery condition band is represented by a 6 dB differential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1. The IRD General Machinery Vibration Severity Chart is an improvement on a pass/fail criteria such as that used by the chiller manufacturer because it provides a graduated scale of machine condition. The tolerances in the chart are for frequencies between 1.6 and 1667 hertz and apply to most rotating machinery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While absolute criteria are fine for acceptance testing, more sensitive criteria are needed for making accurate diagnoses as part of a predictive maintenance program. A relative criterion is best if your goal is to diagnose machine health accurately. Relative criteria are defined by averaging vibration measurements taken on several identical machines, all tested under similar operating conditions. For this case history, the acceptance criteria were constructed by averaging spectral measurements from 12 identical chillers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bronze disk mounting pads were mounted in the same location on each machine and the data were collected with the chiller operating at about 80 percent rated load. The test spectra were developed into average baseline spectral data after manual review of the data, so each test showed the machines to be in reasonably good condition. Due to variations of test data among machines in the sample, standard deviations (sigma) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, an average plus one sigma spectral mask was calculated. Statistically, about 85 percent of the vibration amplitudes should fall below the average plus one sigma mask. Unlike vendor defined pass/fail criteria or absolute criteria such as the IRD chart, the relative criteria allow the machines themselves to define what is acceptable. Figure 3 is an example of one axis of the relative acceptance criteria used in this case history. Figure 4 shows the average and average plus sigma level for all three axes for both the low- and high-range data. If one or more peaks in an 800-line spectrum exceeds the average plus sigma amplitude criterion, that fact alone does not indicate a significant problem (see the section on diagnostic strategies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The average (bottom spectrum in blue) and average plus one standard deviation (top spectrum in red) criteria shown are for the radial axis.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Average baseline data from two separate facilities: Plant A (top 6 spectra) and Plant B (bottom 6 spectra). Each plant has 18 identical model chillers. The running speed of the Plant B data reflects a different average running speed (2,982 rpm), which reflects in input line frequency of 50 Hz common to Europe. This average and average plus sigma data is from the free end motor bearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Friction Bearing Problems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Bearing problems are some of the most common types of faults diagnosed by vibration analysis programs. In the early stages, a defective bearing will produce vibration components with frequencies that are not multiples of shaft rotation rate. The exact values of these non-synchronous frequencies are based on bearing geometry. They can be calculated if the race and roller dimensions are known. In practice, most facility engineers do not document the manufacturer and model number for bearings in machinery, and so must rely on other methods to determine bearing frequencies. A set of rules for determining approximate values of bearing tone frequencies follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race (BPFO)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Ball Pass Frequency Inner Race (BPFI)&lt;br /&gt;
	= # of rollers x shaft speed x 0.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Fundamental Train Frequency (FTF)&lt;br /&gt;
	= speed x 0.4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	The chiller manufacturer stated that the ball bearing in this case is an SKF 7318. The bearing table confirms that 4.9xM and 7.1xM are the outer and inner ball pass frequencies, respectively. These frequencies are presented as orders, where the suffix &amp;ldquo;xM&amp;rdquo; represents &amp;ldquo;times motor shaft rotation rate&amp;rdquo;. Looking at the frequencies and the rules of thumb, it is evident that this bearing has 12 rolling elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ball-bearing wear becomes increasingly evident as harmonics (integer multiples) of these ball-pass frequency peaks occur in the vibration spectra. Depending on the nature of the defect, there also may be strong 1xM sidebands around the bearing tones or their harmonics. Extreme bearing wear creates an abnormally high noise floor in the high-range spectra between about 70 and 100 times shaft rotation rate (70xM to 100xM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commonly Used Diagnostic Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When evaluating bearing wear using vibration analysis, a consistent method of collecting and analyzing the data is necessary. Broadband vibration meters normally cannot detect bearing wear until the later stages. As a result, the maintenance technician has little warning to plan a repair, and risks catastrophic failure. Diagnostic techniques that rely on high-frequency phenomena such as shock pulse or ultrasonic energy are very effective at early detection of bearing wear. However, they typically lack the ability to detect the many machinery faults that manifest themselves with vibration at lower frequencies. Triaxial narrow band spectral analysis using relative acceptance criteria can accurately provide early warning of bearing defects. It also can be used to diagnose a wide range of other machinery problems such as imbalance, misalignment, impeller clearance problem, looseness and resonance. In this case, the third technique is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band data required for analysis includes two frequency ranges of high-resolution (800 lines) triaxial spectral data measured at a single point on a rigid part of the bearing housing. The low-range data is typically 0 to 10 orders of shaft speed where the fundamental bearing tones are easily seen. The high-range data is typically 0 to 100 orders of shaft speed, where the bearing tone harmonics and high-frequency noise floor are seen. While this may seem like an overkill of data for a single location, the mounting method and the bar code allow for simple and efficient data collection. Furthermore, processing the data on a PC is fast and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The narrow band fault model for a bearing defect, as taught in most basic vibration analysis courses, includes the following four conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonic series of peaks with a non-synchronous fundamental frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1xM and/or fundamental train frequency (FTF) sidebands around any of the peaks in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased high-frequency noise floor magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonics series of the shaft rotation rate caused by excessive bearing looseness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibration Analysis (Human vs. Computer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The sheer quantity of narrow band data needed to accurately diagnose bearing defects requires that all the routine data reduction and logic functions are accomplished by a personal computer with an expert system. It is not time-economical for a human analyst to accomplish all the routine tasks that a computer can do in mere seconds. The first step is to order normalize the spectra with respect to the shaft rotating speed. The next step is to extract the amplitudes for the principal forcing frequencies and other peaks in the test data. The third step is to use the fault model described earlier to identify the pattern for a bearing defect. The last step is to determine the severity of the bearing defect, given that the pattern exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expert system logic used to identify the fault and its severity was created as part of an empirical process whereby the automated diagnosis on a large population of machines was compared to the diagnosis that a vibration expert would make on those same machines. The expert logic rules are, therefore, a reflection of exactly how a vibration expert would analyze the data. Because of this, an expert system can be no better than the vibration analyst who creates it. Because all the steps outlined in the previous paragraph are routine and repetitive, a modern computer can rapidly perform all four analysis steps in a few seconds per machine. The expert system then generates a text-based report for the chiller motor bearing wear as shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manual Review of the Spectral Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 6 shows the motor free end data collected on March 25 on Chiller 4. The Avg + sigma mask (red), are superimposed for comparison. The x-axis is scaled in units of orders where the order &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; represents the rotational rate of the motor. Note the prominent non-synchronous peaks in the axial low range data at 4.9xM and 7.1xM. These peaks correspond to the ball bearing pass frequencies for the motor bearing. In the high-range spectra, harmonic markers are placed on each peak of the harmonic series with 4.9xM spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note that the harmonic series has strong amplitudes in all three axes of the high range while only prominent in the axial direction in the low range data. The high-frequency noise floor is about the same or lower than the one sigma mask telling us that the bearing wear is not to a point of near failure; however, the strong harmonic series implies that a defect is present.&lt;/p&gt;

The three spectra on the left are low-range data and the three spectra on the right are high-range data. The marked peaks in the high-range data represent a 4.9xM spacing that is a BPFO harmonic series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prognostics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There is little doubt whether a bearing fault exists. The machine operators can identify this condition by sound and touch. A more important question is: How much remaining life does this bearing have? The clever vibration analyst will not make a conclusion until a trend has developed and several data sets are available. For each diagnosis, the expert system calculates a severity score based on three things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of peaks that support the diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The amount by which the criterion is exceeded for each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The absolute amplitude of each peak in (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A trend of the severity score is a good indicator of machine health. For each diagnostic rule template, the severity score is mapped into a severity scale that includes slight, moderate, serious and extreme. The algorithm used for determining severity was derived empirically for each diagnosis based on a large amount of test results that had been manually analyzed by vibration experts. If the indications (bearing tones, harmonics, sidebands and noise floor) of bearing wear increase over time, the expert system will recognize this fact and the severity assigned to the bearing wear diagnosis will increase. In the trend plot (Figure 7), the motor bearing wear fault severity has leveled off at a low serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/4/quick/52ae1de5-66e4-4bba-901b-cba639be15f1_bearing7.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7. Expert System Trend Plot for Chiller 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The life expectancy of the bearing is mostly a function of the force on the bearing and the condition does not seem to be getting worse over the past year. Vibration analysis provides quantifiable evidence of the bearing condition and allows the owner to know the condition of his machinery. As the defect worsens, the bearing wear defect pattern will become more prominent. The expert system will respond by assigning a higher severity to the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chiller owner had called in a service engineer from the chiller manufacturer to measure vibration. Using an overall vibration meter, the technician told the owner that no problem existed with the bearing. The chiller manufacturer specifies an overall vibration maximum limit of 0.25 inch/second (peak). In this case, the overall level is probably less than the limit. This highlights one of the problems with using broadband measurements for predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broadband measurements completely missed the indications of bearing wear because broadband measurement is sensitive primarily to the highest peak seen in the spectrum. It does not see the BPFO harmonic series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To learn from this machine, and to obtain the maximum life from the bearing, the facility engineer must closely monitor this machine and compare its data to the average plus one standard deviation for this model of chiller. The expert system severity score is an excellent way to consistently trend the bearing health because it always applies the same logic and looks at a number of features in the data. When the severity increases toward the extreme level and a bearing replacement is ordered, the bearing should be saved and cut open for inspection. Possibly then, this case history would be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Diagnosing a boiler pump motor with an ultrasound detector</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In this video, a maintenance&amp;nbsp;technician uses the UL101, an ultrasound detector, to diagnose a thrust and non-thrust bearing in an injector boiler pump motor. He places the UL101 on the grease fitting and adjusts the UL101&amp;#39;s gain to the lowest possible setting. Lowering the gain setting will isolate the ultrasound to only the bearing being tested.

            <title>Case study: Diagnosing a low-speed gearbox problem</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A few months ago, I was called on to help in the diagnosis of a suspected gearbox problem in a large plant connected with the paper industry. The gearbox in question had an input shaft with a 23-tooth pinion driving a large bull gear with 132 teeth which, in turn, drives another bull gear of the same size. The two gears are connected to large steel rollers about 24 inches in diameter. The two output gears turn at 52 rpm and the pinion turns at 302 rpm (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/e4a73325-6525-4040-a4fd-b8fe362f7bc3_gearbox_figure1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricating oil in the gearbox was regularly subjected to analysis, and the last report stated that there were iron particles in the oil. The maintenance supervisor asked if we could determine the source of the oil contamination, and the first thing we did was to examine the vibration spectra measured near the bearings. The spectra looked normal, without evidence of bearing tones, so we suspected that the metal was coming from one or more of the gears (see Figure 2). The problem then became to identify the faulty gear (if any), so as to allow the maintenance effort to proceed without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/ce84e4c5-2dcd-4ecf-8910-01fb1380e7b6_gearbox_figure2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Synchronous averaging of time domain signals has been around for a long time, but in my opinion, has not been used nearly enough for machine problem diagnosis. In any case, we decided to perform synchronous averaging of the gearbox vibration signature. This involves the use of a tachometer-derived synchronizing trigger in the vibration analyzer to collect of series of waveform samples that are averaged together. The important part of this is that the beginning of each time record must occur at exactly the same time in the rotation of the gear in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This allows the entire vibration signal that comes from the gear to be emphasized in the time domain average, and all the vibration components from the other gears, shaft rpm, and bearing tones, etc., to be averaged out. This produces a time waveform that shows the individual teeth on the gear, with very little contamination from other components from the machine. When doing synchronous averaging, the analysis parameters of the analyzer are adjusted so the time record length spans a little more time than one revolution on the gear. This is easily accomplished since the time record length (T) is the reciprocal of the FFT line spacing (DF) in the spectrum. It is simply a matter of choosing a frequency span and number of lines so 1/DF is longer than 1 divided by the gear speed in hertz (Hz). Of course, it is possible to look at the spectrum taken from a synchronized waveform, but we did not bother to do this since the waveform provided the needed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When using synchronous averaging, the number of averages used must be quite large; usually in the vicinity of 100 or so. For the tests described here, we used 90 averages. (See Figure 3 for the setup details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/d5aa4517-d84e-445d-b62f-3f11e2987d23_gearbox_figure3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases of synchronous averaging, the time record is much more interesting that the spectrum, since the spectrum contains no time information, and the time domain shows any irregularities in the gear meshing. In this case, all the spectra were unremarkable, simply showing the gear mesh frequency and some harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When we did synchronous averaging on each of the two bull gears, there was no indication of any defect in the waveform. But, when we performed the same test on the pinion, the waveform told another story. There was an obvious area on the gear where the meshing with the bull gear was very noisy and non-uniform (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/93fb2c27-5b70-4830-bb6c-04de63d335bc_gearbox_figure4.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On looking at this data, we called for an inspection of the gear, but the maintenance chief was skeptical, saying that gearboxes with more vibration that this one had run for 20 years without any problems. But we insisted, and finally an access plate was removed so we could look at the gears. We found that the keyway in the pinion shaft was badly worn such that the gear could be rotated back and forth on the shaft by about one-half of a tooth at the edge of the gear. There was also visible clearance between the shaft and the bore of the pinion. The bull gears showed no sign of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We called one of the engineers at the gearbox factory and described the situation. He said the problem occurred during installation when the interference fit between the pinion and the shaft was too loose. He said the shaft and pinion would have to be replaced, and very soon, to avoid a catastrophic failure. This made believers out of the maintenance people who originally thought the gearbox need not be overhauled. From that time on, the vibration monitoring program at this plant has enjoyed a much increased popularity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned earlier, synchronous averaging is not a new technique, but it seems to be seldom used in industry. It is not a difficult thing to do, and can result in information about a machine that is almost impossible to obtain any other way. Furthermore, there are many analyzers on the market that do it, from small battery-powered units to larger mains-powered systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following photos of the pinion illustrate the damage:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CBM and RCM help to maximize safety, uptime at YICT</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Being one of the biggest single container terminals in the world brings certain expectations from the operators and customers alike. Professionalism, reliability and efficiency are three of the most important and, coupled with a high regard for safety, are major focus areas for the Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), in Shenzhen, southern China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With 74 mammoth sized cranes lining the five deep water berths and about 10 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) containers a year coming in and out of the terminal, it is an extremely complex task to keep everything running smoothly and safely. But the management of YICT have followed a Total Quality approach to their terminal from the early planning stages through the construction phase and into the running of daily operations. Today, Six Sigma is a guiding tool for process improvement to many things, including the entire maintenance strategy and operations, and their Quay Crane maintenance manager is a Six Sigma black belt. At the YICT Engineering Control Centre he has an ultra modern overview, via CCTV and other monitoring technologies, of many of the equipments and machinery, down to individual electric motors, needed to keep the terminal operating 24 hours round the clock .&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wide-ranging maintenance strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	YICT has applied and included all the various technique and technology in their maintenance strategy starting with time based, then adding condition-based (CBM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) that now ensure the right balance, from a cost and effectiveness viewpoint, for the vast array of equipment and systems under his supervision. One example the company gives is that a CBM approach to a particular gearbox allowed a solution to be made within 2 weeks, compared to 2 months at a port where a similar gearbox, operating on a time based maintenance program, failed unexpectedly. So although they had a potential failure to deal with, the financial and operational damage was only one quarter of that experienced at another port.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the ultimate techniques within a CBM and RCM program is continuous online monitoring, implying that the earliest signs of potential failure are recognized, and fast and adequate corrective action can be taken. It is not the answer to all maintenance concerns, but used wisely it is a very good investment to protect operationally critical or safety critical equipment. And this is an area that YICT has been moving into regarding their quayside cranes. They have now completed a three-year test period with SKF online monitoring technology on gearboxes on two cranes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety &amp;ndash; a key concern&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The monitored gearboxes are positioned 100 meters above ground in the &amp;lsquo;workhouse&amp;rsquo; of the huge dockside cranes. The gearboxes drive the roll drums that lower the heavy duty wire cable that is used to lift the heavy containers on and off the ships and container transport lorries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number one concern here is safety. A sudden failure or seizure of a gearbox could cause a container to swing away from its intended path of movement or drop some meters before the automatic braking system could hold the cable and container in place. With so many people constantly moving around the terminal such gearbox failures are a high priority to avoid. Additionally with a &amp;lsquo;suspended&amp;rsquo; container and an &amp;ldquo;out of commission&amp;rdquo; crane, there would be the loss of productive and throughput capacity to the terminal operators, the container owners and the end customers, who are waiting for the container goods to be delivered.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical components continuously monitored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A major potential cause of gearbox failure is some kind of failure of the bearings that support the gear shafts. Although bearings are high performing mechanical systems, like all machine components and systems they can wear or become damaged over time depending on various conditions of operation, loading, operating environment, etc. If left too long before replacement a catastrophic bearing failure can result that could lead to a gearbox failure and the potential dangers mentioned earlier.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The SKF online system monitors the health of the gear shaft support bearings via vibration sensors placed at specific places on the outside of the gearbox housing. Bearings have particular vibration &amp;ldquo;signatures&amp;rdquo; when working well, working poorly or suffering from wear. And these signatures differ for different bearing types, sizes and loading conditions. So it is important to &amp;ldquo;trend&amp;rdquo; and study each bearing and its operating cycle separately to get a reliable picture of the health of each one. To do this, vibration data is sent to and stored on a server in the Engineering Control Center for later analysis. By constantly monitoring the vibration signals YICT has been able to confidently asses the health of the bearings and, with it, the potential of increasing or excessive bearing wear and associated gearbox failure. So far they have been able to happily continue running the gearboxes and no failures have occurred.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Because the loading and speed conditions of the gearbox varies during operation it requires special skills and knowledge to interpret the vibration signals correctly. SKF provided close support and advice to YICT engineers during the first year of running and remained on-hand during the next two years of operation. Additionally, YICT engineers attended SKF courses on condition monitoring to improve the own knowledge and skills levels.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving on with confidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Equipped now with fully trained condition monitoring engineers and three years confident experience, YICT is keen to expand the condition monitoring to more cranes and will investigate SKF&amp;rsquo;s latest technology. With 32 analogue channels and 16 digital channels, the new system will allow bearing, gearboxes and motors to be monitored at the same time, saving a lot of maintenance costs in the process. And this will be another step in YICT&amp;rsquo;s continuous process improvement Six Sigma-driven program that delivers professionalism, reliability, efficiency and safety to its port&amp;rsquo;s machinery and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/JvWDeY35Sb4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Fluke creates online glossary of vibration terms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Fluke Corporation has made available at its Web site a glossary of the key vibration terms that those involved in equipment maintenance and vibration diagnosis may encounter when evaluating machine vibration.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the world of mechanical maintenance, vibration remains one of the earliest indicators of a machine&amp;#39;s health and the effects of vibration can be severe. Unchecked machine vibration can accelerate rates of wear (i.e. reduce bearing life), damage equipment, create noise, cause safety problems and lead to degradation in plant working conditions. Vibration can cause machinery to consume excessive power and may damage product quality. In the worst cases, vibration can damage equipment so severely as to knock it out of service and halt plant production. Consequently, knowing the basic terminology of machine vibration and analysis is essential for anyone who is part of a preventive maintenance program or plant maintenance team.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Testing tip: Armature defects on DC motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Current analysis of DC motors can provide health assessment of the DC armature while the motor is running. Armature-related anomalies can include commutator bar defects, riser defects (very common) and shorted turns or coils in the armature circuit. The fundamental analysis of these anomalies starts with understanding that the bar, riser or winding with a fault passes under and out of the carbon brush face at a rate of the shaft speed times the number of brushes passed in a rotation. This causes a modulation of the DC armature current. A DC motor turning at 2,000 rpm with four brush holders&amp;nbsp;has a brush passing frequency of 8,000 rpm, or 133.33 Hz. Trending of the brush passing frequency amplitude is highly recommended for early identification of developing armature circuit anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Methods to ensure sanitary practices in pet food plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Pet food plant owners and operators are looking for innovative ways to modify existing facilities to accommodate pet food processes. But as recent recalls of food due to salmonella contamination demonstrate, there are significant challenges in manufacturing, packaging and delivering these products. Here&amp;rsquo;s how one company made the shift from a grain processing-type mentality to a pet food manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Culture of existing plant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When a major pet food company wanted to upgrade food safety in several facilities, they turned to SSOE, an engineering firm with significant and nationally recognized expertise in food processing, pharmaceutical, and health and beauty product manufacturing. After a brief engineering analysis of the facilities, key processes that might create risk or potential pathways for microbial contamination were identified. SSOE&amp;rsquo;s experience with sanitation requirements across many different manufacturing sectors provided the needed insights that allowed the enhancements to be completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SSOE&amp;rsquo;s experience also suggested that it was not only manufacturing processes that required re-engineering; the understanding of plant personnel toward sanitary practices needed to be emphasized.&amp;nbsp;Since the existing facilities had not been involved in processing products for human consumption, and thus under the aegis of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a culture of sanitary manufacturing did not exist. Not only were plant workers unfamiliar with sanitary food processes, but corporate management did not realize the extent to which plant design and workplace culture would have to change. Every aspect of the facilities &amp;ndash; from product movement through the plant, contamination from outside sources, to equipment design &amp;ndash; all required rethinking in light of FDA regulation, sanitary practices and Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key contamination pathways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Four primary contamination pathways must be examined to determine whether there is impact on sanitary operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		the path of the product through the facility from raw material to final packaged product&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		room environment in product processing areas;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		areas that surround process areas such as hallways and packaging;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		office, ancillary and exterior areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The major plant areas that are typically impacted by the conversion included processing lines, floor surfaces, drains, waste systems, HVAC, dryers, raw ingredient handling and packaging &amp;ndash; nearly every system in the plant. In order to expedite the retrofitting of a plant, SSOE often places a senior food processing engineer on site, both to analyze plant and equipment and work practices&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface contact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Every surface which contacts a product must be examined for potential microbial growth. Moisture, in contact with product, is one of the primary concerns and creates the potential for unsanitary conditions. Concrete surfaces, common in many industrial environments, are highly problematic for food production. By its nature, concrete is porous and allows water and moisture to collect &amp;ndash; an ideal location for bacterial growth. The solution may be using a sealant or coating on concrete surfaces that inhibits microbial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The treatment of fines, the product dust that collects at the bottom of the all process and packaging equipment, may be another contamination pathway that is overlooked. Collection methods for fines require investigation, and current handling routes may need rerouting to prevent cross-contamination between finished product and fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Existing plants, often in proximity to agricultural areas, are subject to airborne dust, pollen and pesticides migrating into the plant and contaminating product. Positive air pressure, a common strategy for sanitation control for food areas but rarely seen in pet food plants, has to be considered. Positive air pressure systems create a pressure differential between processing areas and outside spaces that prevents the airborne flow of contaminants to sanitary areas. Critical to retrofitting an existing plant, the design of a positive air pressure system must determine how the plant can be zoned for proper air flow and pressurization. Based on those needs, additional fans, ductwork and air filtration may be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water-related issues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Water is a critical utility for most manufacturing plants and even a raw material for the product. Water impacts the manufacturing process in numerous, sometimes unpredictable, ways. &amp;nbsp;Microorganisms require food, water, a suitable temperature and time to propagate. Control of water is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Existing facilities are often constructed with wall, floor or ceiling surfaces which retain moisture and, hence, promote bacterial growth. While floors or walls may be sealed to prevent microbial growth, a more effective strategy is to control or minimize water usage. Some facilities, in particular, frequently use water to clean floors and surfaces. Floor drains which collect wash water, then hold water in their traps creating extremely unsanitary conditions. Alternatives to cleaning with water such as vacuum systems or pressurized carbon dioxide may be proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While grain processing-type environments and facilities may be candidates for conversion into sanitary pet food plants, many issues must first be investigated. Although pet foods were not formerly considered a likely source of human illness, recent salmonella cases and recalls have demonstrated the potential seriousness of pet food contamination. All pet food manufacturers must re-evaluate their processes and policies in light of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Key to these efforts are the services of an experienced engineering consultant who understands food and product safety and contamination. An experienced engineer should bring knowledge gained from other related industries &amp;ndash; food, beverage, consumer products, pharmaceuticals &amp;ndash; to bear on the conversion of any existing plant. Just as crucial, is the recognition that sanitary practices and processes require a &amp;ldquo;cultural&amp;rdquo; shift by management and staff. The outside expertise of the engineering consultant can tremendously assist in that shift as well as assess and implement new sanitary processes. Pet food manufacturers can then position themselves and their products as healthy, safe and trustworthy in this burgeoning marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf211.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (fig.1) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. Figure 1 shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (Figure 2). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf212.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. Figure 3 shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf213.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Grease testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs. The R0F test rigs have been upgraded (R0F+), making them very flexible in terms of speed, load and temperature. A large number of R0F and R0F+ can be found at the SKF Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center, enabling 140 tests to be carried out simultaneously (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf214.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. Figure 5 shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf215.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (Figure 6) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf216.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. Figure 7 plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 8 shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. Table 1 shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties. All three greases are widely used and approved by various wind turbine OEMs. The choice of grease depends on the type of sealing, operating conditions and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/skf219.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Table 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers complete customer solutions for main shaft applications encompassing greases, housings, seals, bearing configurations, lubricating systems, lock nuts, mounting services, lubricants and analyses and condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF is contributing to sustainability and supporting environmentally friendly solutions through further development and application of its knowledge in grease lubrication, thus prolonging the service life of bearing systems and reducing friction, leading to less energy consumption. Extended service life and relubrication intervals lead to less need for maintenance and to a reduction of waste. This is achieved by using the knowledge obtained from fundamental R&amp;amp;D and model development in combination with product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Prolonged bearing life through effective grease lubrication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF&amp;rsquo;s research &amp;amp; development efforts are directed toward supporting product development in bearings and seals for which the understanding of grease lubrication is crucial, since most bearing failures are caused by improper lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF has in-house competence to analyze lubricants and the impact of lubrication on bearing performance by means of a broad range of sophisticated chemical, measuring and test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lubricant and lubrication system is often integrated into the bearing system where specific greases are chosen, dedicated to the application. SKF does not manufacture grease but, in partnerships with preferred suppliers, has developed a range of greases, both for initial fill and the aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication knowledge also extends to automatic lubricators, multi-point and single-point lubricators, centralized lubrication systems and total-loss and circulating centralized lubricating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF also provides training in lubricant selection, lubricant handling, inspection, disposal and reliability maintenance. A separate SKF business unit, Engineering and Consultancy Services, helps to develop products relating to rotating shafts or bearing applications. Obviously, lubrication (especially grease lubrication) is very important here. Application engineering, consultancy services, training, lubrication management, condition monitoring, reliability maintenance, technical support, tools, products and systems together form the complete SKF lubrication solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication for bearing applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The perfect bearing would be lubricant free. However, lubricant is needed to separate the rolling elements from the raceways in order to prevent damage due to (micro) slip. The ideal separating medium is liquid, which is able to accommodate shear with low frictional losses and may replenish the bearing surfaces (self-healing action).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is widely used for its consistency, which makes it easy to use; it will not easily leak out, and it provides some sealing action. Grease protects against corrosion and lowers friction values, compared with oil lubrication, provided that grease with a good quality and filling rate is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lubricating grease has a finite life [2,3], which is generally shorter than bearing fatigue life [1]. Advanced bearing life models exist, and as grease life often dominates bearing service life, a grease life model is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the complexity of grease lubrication [2] means that no physical models for the prediction of grease life are available today. SKF has developed an empirical model where grease life (or the relubrication interval) can be calculated for a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For deep groove ball bearings, SKF has developed the Grease Performance Factor (GPF) concept [3] (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) for the prediction of life for well-known greases where data are available. A GPF=1 corresponds to the performance of a &amp;ldquo;good-quality grease&amp;rdquo;. Many grease types outperform the standard &amp;ldquo;good quality&amp;rdquo; and will have a GPF greater than 1. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@1"&gt;Figure 1 &lt;/a&gt;shows the grease life as a function of temperature, speed (n dm) and grease quality [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF recommends temperature performance limits well within standardized temperature limits (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@2"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;). In between the recommended performance limits, the &amp;ldquo;green zone&amp;rdquo; of the SKF traffic light concept, the grease will function reliably and grease life (and relubrication interval) can be determined [8]. Temperatures in the amber zone on both sides of the green zone should occur only for very short periods. With time, temperature, mechanical working, ageing and the possible ingress of contaminants, grease in a bearing deteriorates and loses its lubricating properties. After the initial grease fill during installation, additional grease relubrication can realize the desired service life. Three factors for relubrication are important to achieve reliability: grease type, grease quantity and frequency of application. The supplied quantity and frequency of the greasing depends on the operating conditions and the supplying method: manually, or by an automatic lubricator or lubricating system. This knowledge is embodied in expert systems: LubeSelect, LuBase and DialSet, available through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease lubrication physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Understanding the physics and chemistry of grease lubrication is crucial in predicting grease performance in a bearing. Grease life testing under application conditions is usually impossible, as an application will be designed for a very long endurance, which would lead to unacceptably long testing times. In practice, test conditions are chosen to be more severe (e.g., higher temperature and/or higher speeds) than in the application. In addition, grease life test rigs are sometimes operated with standardized bearings, which differ from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease performance depends not only on the grease properties, but also on the internal geometry of the particular bearing type. Even within bearing types, the performance depends on the internal geometry, where internal dimensions, sealing solution, cage configuration and cage material are most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By knowing the physics and chemistry of lubricating greases, test results can be &amp;ldquo;extrapolated&amp;rdquo; to conditions for which test data are not available. Moreover, grease life test data are used to validate physical models developed for grease lubrication. SKF&amp;rsquo;s Engineering &amp;amp; Research Center has developed state-of-the-art knowledge and models in tribology/lubrication and physics/chemistry, which support the understanding of grease lubrication. Scientific areas supporting the development of grease prediction models include rheology, fluid dynamics, chemistry, elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the early stage of bearing operation, grease will flow. Most of the grease ends up adjacent to the raceways and some remains inside the &amp;ldquo;swept area&amp;rdquo;. Internal distribution of the grease inside the bearing during and after this phase requires understanding of fluid dynamics and the grease&amp;rsquo;s rheological properties. Applying fluid dynamics theory to grease flow is not simple; after all, a lubricating grease is not really a fluid. Grease ages by mechanical and thermal work, which is severe in a bearing, adding complexity to the problem. Fluid dynamics/rheology theory is also used to predict the oil-bleeding properties of grease. Understanding the chemistry in grease lubrication is important to predict the oxidation of base oil and thickener [4]. In addition, grease chemistry determines the boundary lubrication properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubricating grease is supposed to develop a separating film, which may be a boundary film or may be formed by hydrodynamic action. In rolling bearings, the elastic deformation of the bodies in contact will generate a favorable inlet geometry for film build-up, and this phenomenon is called &amp;ldquo;elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication&amp;rdquo; (EHL). This theory is well developed for oil lubrication but not yet for grease lubrication, where the film thickness is dominated by the availability of lubricant on the running tracks (generally referred to as &amp;ldquo;starved EHL&amp;rdquo; [5]) and by thickener &amp;ldquo;particles&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an interferometry picture of a grease-lubricated contact. The film is not smooth, due to thickener particles entering the contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, the grease lubrication process is not deterministic. There is a statistical distribution in failures, which further complicates the prediction. SKF has developed a sound knowledge of Weibull statistics, which is used to evaluate bearing life and grease life test data [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grease testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To predict lubricating grease life in a bearing, SKF has developed test machines that are used throughout the industry. Traditionally, these were the R0F (ball bearings) and R2F (spherical roller bearing) test rigs.

&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to grease life testing, functional testing is done on start-up torque, friction, corrosion resistance, vibrations (V2F), grease noise (BeQuiet+), etc. A well-equipped chemical lab supports the evaluation of the test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product development and grease lubrication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Several examples demonstrate how understanding of grease lubrication has influenced new product development, including a new generation of SKF Energy Efficient bearings. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@5"&gt;Figure 5&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows an SKF Energy Efficient (E2) deep groove ball bearing. SKF E2 deep groove ball bearings have frictional losses that are at least 30 percent lower when compared with the same size standard SKF bearings. Developed for grease-lubricated applications, SKF E2 bearings also consume less lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Comparison between the grease life in a standard and SKF E2 deep groove ball bearing (&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@6"&gt;Figure 6&lt;/a&gt;) shows grease life is doubled, effectively doubling bearing service life. The friction reduction can be ascribed to improved grease lubrication &amp;ndash; i.e., unique grease in combination with improved internal geometry and a new cage design. This is a good example of how grease development has been integrated into bearing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new grease with excellent anti-false brinelling properties for wind turbine blade and yaw bearings arose when SKF developed its own in-house test rig and method for false brinelling. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@7"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;plots the test results with a standard grease and the new blade and yaw bearing grease, where the friction is monitored as a function of the number of oscillations. If friction continuously increases over time, then failure is about to happen. The blue lines represent the measurements for commercial grease. The green lines are the measurements with the SKF LGBB 2 grease, which forms a protective tribo-layer and shows very low values of friction for many cycles and will lead to long service life in bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@8"&gt;Figure 8 &lt;/a&gt;shows the window of operation for various greases in blade bearing-like conditions. In case of partial slip, the oscillation is so small that the centre of the Hertzian contact will stick, and slip only takes place on the edges of the contact. Gross slip takes place when the oscillations are so severe that even the centre of the contact will slide. Fretting typically occurs between surfaces intended to be fixed, however subjected to small oscillations and is characterized by generated wear debris that stay entrapped inside the contact area. The SKF LGBB 2 grease has excellent anti-fretting properties and can also be used for large oscillations. The grease performs well at low temperatures and has good anti-corrosion properties, making it very suitable for wind turbine blade and yaw bearing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For paper mill applications, SKF has developed the &amp;ldquo;SKF polymer thickened lubricant&amp;rdquo;, or polymer grease, replacing traditional soap thickener with a polymer [7]. The polymer is non-polar, i.e., the soap does not compete with the metal surface to attract the additives. Conventional grease contains 10 to 20 percent metal-based soap thickener (polar) and 80 to 90 percent base oil, including the additive package. The polymer-thickened lubricant contains 10 to 13 percent polypropylene (PP), a non-polar material, and 87 to 90 percent oil, including the additive package. The unique process for the formation of polymer-thickened grease is the innovative heating and quenching operation of the polymer, which is dissolved in oil. This results in a three-dimensional net structure, which functions like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, metal-soap-thickened grease. The grease gives a long life on the R0F test rig, even in the absence of additives, making it more environmentally friendly with prolonged relubrication intervals. This will lead to reduced grease consumption. The new polymer grease has excellent low-temperature performance, and less energy is required in its production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grease requirements for the main shaft bearings in wind turbines relate to the harsh environment where the grease has to achieve high reliability under heavy contact loading, low speeds and oscillating and standstill conditions. Additional challenges arise for wind turbines installed in offshore and cold climates. SKF has developed three different greases for wind turbine main-shaft applications. &lt;a href="http://evolution.skf.com/fig@9"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the greases&amp;rsquo; properties. All three greases are widely used and approved by various wind turbine OEMs. The choice of grease depends on the type of sealing, operating conditions and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers complete customer solutions for main shaft applications encompassing greases, housings, seals, bearing configurations, lubricating systems, lock nuts, mounting services, lubricants and analyses and condition monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SKF is contributing to sustainability and supporting environmentally friendly solutions through further development and application of its knowledge in grease lubrication, thus prolonging the service life of bearing systems and reducing friction, leading to less energy consumption. Extended service life and relubrication intervals lead to less need for maintenance and to a reduction of waste. This is achieved by using the knowledge obtained from fundamental R&amp;amp;D and model development in combination with product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Smith &amp; Wesson hits the mark with oil conditioning system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1852, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson has been associated with high-performance and high-precision firearms for safety, security and protection, as well as sport. To maintain efficient production speeds and keep up with customer demand, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson employs manufacturing processes that use approximately 30,000 gallons of machine lubricant oil per year, with 19,800 gallons recycled each year. Processing and recycling this oil became a significant burden, involving the excessive costs and inconvenience of third-party oil treatment processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil processing and recycling is an important part of numerous manufacturing processes, including those in the steel, molding, foundry, mining and power generation industries. The machines utilizing this lube and hydraulic oil require clean, dry oil for dependable operation. However, during use, oil becomes contaminated with process particulate and moisture &amp;ndash; causing wear and tear on machinery, and potentially leading to machine failure. Processing contaminated oil so that it can be reused is a common solution, as it saves considerable costs over oil replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As with many companies, when the contaminated lube oil began to interfere with machine operation, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson contracted with an outside service to filter, clean and dry the oil, removing all unnecessary moisture and contaminants. This oil processing and recycling program required Smith &amp;amp; Wesson to accumulate and store 1,500 gallons of used oil over a two-month period. The company then enlisted the help of a mobile processor to treat the oil at a cost of $4,375 every month. The total cost of this program was $52,500 annually &amp;ndash; a lower cost per gallon than oil replacement would run, averaging $6 to $8 per gallon for mineral oil and up to $60 per gallon for synthetic oils. However, the still-significant expenses and inconvenience of using a third party led Smith &amp;amp; Wesson to pursue a new oil conditioning solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Filtration Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	MSC Filtration Technologies, a Pentair Industrial distributor, introduced Smith &amp;amp; Wesson to the Driflex Oil Conditioning System, marking the beginning of a fast-tracked project with Henkel Chemical Management to evaluate the system. The Driflex system is designed to remove all free, emulsified and dissolved water from oil in batches of all sizes. The system initially appealed to Smith &amp;amp; Wesson from a convenience standpoint: The system would allow the company to process oil in their own facility, on their own schedule and in virtually any volume they wanted. In addition, keeping the oil processing in-house would eliminate the costs of clean-up services associated with off-site processors or third-party truck-mounted vacuum dehydrator systems. Not only did clean-up services cost tens of thousands of dollars, but they also carried the risk that the oil would be permanently damaged and lost during the clean-up process. Along with eliminating this risk and additional cost, the Driflex system would improve overall oil quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Driflex Oil Conditioning System couples Pentair&amp;rsquo;s patented UltiDri membrane technology with high-efficiency filtration to cost-effectively remove known, harmful contaminants from vital lubrication and hydraulic fluids. The system operates by flowing contaminated oil through a particulate filtration stage, followed by a membrane filtration and an air drying process. The result: Both particulate and moisture are removed from the oil, and the oil is restored to optimum condition for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smith &amp;amp; Wesson processes lube oil in 250 to 300 gallon totes, replacing two to three totes &amp;ndash; or 500 to 900 gallons of oil &amp;ndash; per week. To service the oil, the company selected a 4 gallon-per-minute Driflex Model DF-04L4CS400, selected to meet their volume and processing time requirements. A Driflex system of this size is capable of processing the company&amp;rsquo;s typical weekly volume of oil within a few days, with no outside schedules to accommodate or third-party expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solving Process Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Despite the comprehensive capabilities and advantages the Driflex system offered, a few challenges remained. Unfiltered oil quality varies depending upon how many times it has been recycled in the past, as well as how much particulate and moisture it has accumulated over its service life. Smith &amp;amp; Wesson&amp;rsquo;s unfiltered oil presented a significant challenge, as it contained a fairly heavy load of fine metal casting and grinding dust: 350 milligrams per liter, with particles ranging in size from 2 to 10 microns. This contamination prevented the Driflex system from providing optimum oil conditioning. To handle this heightened contamination, a duplex, prefiltration housing unit &amp;ndash; Pentair Industrial Model H8836 &amp;ndash; containing 5-micron Triflex Mega Cartridges was installed to treat the oil before it entered the Driflex system. This cartridge prefiltration system successfully removed the fine particulate before oil conditioning took place, allowing the Driflex unit to effectively remove moisture during the conditioning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another difficulty arose when a process accident during the test period introduced a great deal of water to the unfiltered oil. After this incident, the oil&amp;rsquo;s moisture content registered at 2 percent, which is 20 times higher than normal. Despite these unusual conditions, the Driflex Oil Conditioning System still delivered optimum results, simply taking several additional days to process the oil. Through continued recirculation, the oil was processed until the desired level of dryness was achieved, without interruption to Smith &amp;amp; Wesson&amp;rsquo;s operation or oil quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall Cost Savings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By employing the Driflex Oil Conditioning System in their operations, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson has significantly reduced their oil processing and recycling costs. After purchasing the Driflex system, the company received a return on their investment in only two months. The savings continue, as the system&amp;rsquo;s annual operating cost is $4,500 &amp;ndash; compared to the $52,500 Smith &amp;amp; Wesson spent annually through an outside service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An additional benefit of using the Driflex system is the ability for Smith &amp;amp; Wesson to recycle smaller batches of oil, which would have not been feasible to process though the prior solution. Small batches were often discarded, as their low volume prohibited them from being stored; it was cost-prohibitive to try to accumulate enough oil from these batches to warrant outside processing. Smith &amp;amp; Wesson can now process and reuse oil in batches of all sizes, with no valuable resources going to waste &amp;ndash; the value of which is still to be realized.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Plant ensures reliability with predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	LCRA&amp;#39;s utility operations are full of electronic and moving parts. Making sure all those parts stay in working order is the job of predictive maintenance crews. Heat-sensing cameras and vibration detectors are just of couple of the modern tools the crews use to ensure the power and water stay on. Watch as a crew gives an irrigation pumping plant an end-of-season check-up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A basic principle of machinery vibration analysis is evaluating whether specific vibration amplitudes are excessive. The use of vibration equipment in preventive maintenance involves keeping a vibration history on individual pieces of equipment in a plant, keeping a record of all PM heat and when the unit was greased and what type of grease was used.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing analysis kit provides oil and vibration condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit now is available, providing all the necessary equipment and consumables for oil and overall machine vibration condition monitoring. The kit is designed to provide fast, accurate results for multiple oil parameters, on-site maintenance decisions and assessment of overall machine condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supplied ready to use in a heavy-duty aluminum case, the SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit&amp;rsquo;s main feature is the SKF Machine Condition Advisor (MCA). The MCA simultaneously measures machine vibration signals and temperature to indicate machine health and bearing condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Complementing the MCA is a test cell, a lubrication assessment tool engineered to provide accurate results for Water-in-Oil (lubricants) and Total Base Number (TBN) tests. The water-in-oil test helps maintain equipment by indicating if water appears in lubricants, which enables intervention that protects the equipment from damage. &amp;nbsp;The Total Base Number provides an indication of the oil&amp;rsquo;s alkaline reserve and ability to neutralize acids from combustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The SKF Advanced Bearing Analysis Kit provides maintenance engineers with a condition monitoring solution that helps with on-site maintenance decisions to more effectively maintain plant equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Torsten Bark, product project manager, SKF. &amp;ldquo;Water contamination can cause various problems in lubricating oils, and the tools in the kit indentify those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the kit contains a Viscostick and Insolubles. The Viscostick provides a simple &amp;ldquo;go/no go&amp;rdquo; result when the distillate fuel dilutions of an SAE 30 to 40 engine oil is tested. The Insolubles detects high insolubles from diesel engine combustion products such as fuel ash, carbon, partially oxidized fuel, oil oxidation products and spent lubrication additive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Phase analysis: Making vibration analysis easier</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is mostly a learned skill. It is based 70 percent on experience and 30 percent on classroom training and self study. It takes years to become a confident and competent vibration analyst. When the analysis is wrong, the recommendations for repair also will be incorrect. No vibration analyst wants to make the wrong call. In this business, credibility is gained in small steps and lost in large chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A vibration sensor placed on a bearing housing and connected to a vibration analyzer provides time, frequency and amplitude information in the form of a waveform and a spectrum (Figure 1). This data is the foundation for vibration analysis. It contains the signatures of nearly all mechanical and electrical defects present on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style2" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 1. Vibration Waveform and Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vibration analysis process involves determining the vibration severity, identifying frequencies and patterns, associating the peaks and patterns with mechanical or electrical components, forming conclusions and, if necessary, making recommendations for repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everybody involved in vibration analysis knows that analyzing vibration is not easy nor automated. Have you ever wondered why? Here are a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Machines Have Multiple Faults:&lt;/strong&gt; The vibration patterns we learn in training and read about in books just don&amp;rsquo;t look the same in the real world. We learn how mechanical and electrical faults look in the purest form &amp;ndash; as if there was always only that one problem on the machine causing vibration. Machines usually have more than one vibration-producing fault. At a minimum, all machines have some unbalance and misalignment. When other faults develop, the waveform and spectrum quickly become complicated and difficult to analyze. The data no longer matches the fault patterns we have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Cause and Effect Vibration:&lt;/strong&gt; For every action, there is a reaction. Some of the vibration we measure is the effect of other problems. For example, the force caused by rotor unbalance can make the machine look like it is out of alignment, loose or rubbing. Consider all of the things that shake and rattle on your car when one tire goes out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Many Fault Types Have Similar Patterns: &lt;/strong&gt;Because machine rotors rotate at a particular speed, and vibration is a cyclical force, many mechanical and electrical faults exhibit similar frequency patterns that make it difficult to distinguish one fault from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning to analyze vibration just takes time. Training courses, technical publications and other resources such as online resources and commercial self teaching material are available that can improve analysis skills and shorten the learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is one diagnostic technique which quickly gets to the source of most vibration problems. It is possibly the most powerful of all vibration diagnostic techniques. It has been around as long as vibration analysis itself yet hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten a lot of attention, and it&amp;rsquo;s rare to find good information about the subject. What is this technique? It&amp;rsquo;s called phase analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Phase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is the position of a rotating part at any instant with respect to a fixed point. Phase gives us the vibration direction. Tuning a car engine using a timing light and inductive sensor is an application of phase analysis (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 2. Engine tuning using a timing light is phase analysis.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A phase study is a collection of phase measurements made on a machine or structure and evaluated to reveal information about relative motion between components. In vibration analysis, phase is measured using absolute or relative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Absolute phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured with one sensor and one tachometer referencing a mark on the rotating shaft (Figure 3). At each measurement point, the analyzer calculates the time between the tachometer trigger and the next positive waveform peak vibration. This time interval is converted to degrees and displayed as the absolute phase (Figure 4). Phase can be measured at shaft rotational frequency or any whole number multiple of shaft speed (synchronous frequencies). Absolute phase is required for rotor balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 3. Absolute Phase Measurement &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 4. Absolute phase is calculated between the tach signal and vibration waveform.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Relative phase&lt;/strong&gt; is measured on a multi-channel vibration analyzer using two or more (similar type) vibration sensors. The analyzer must be able to measure cross-channel phase. One single-axis sensor serves as the fixed reference and is placed somewhere on the machine (typically on a bearing housing). Another single-axis or triaxial sensor is moved sequentially to all of the other test points (Figure 5). At each test point, the analyzer compares waveforms between the fixed and roving sensors. Relative phase is the time difference between the waveforms at a specific frequency converted to degrees (Figure 6). Relative phase does not require a tachometer so phase can be measured at any frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 5. Relative Phase Measurement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left" class="style1"&gt;
	&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Relative Phase Calculated Between Two Vibration Waveforms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both types of phase measurements are easy to make. Relative phase is the most convenient way to measure phase on a machine because the machine does not need to be stopped to install reflective tape on the shaft. Phase can be measured at any frequency. Most single-channel vibration analyzers can measure absolute phase. Multi-channel vibration analyzers like the Pruftechnik VibXpert illustrated in Figure 7 have standard functions for measuring both absolute and relative phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 7. Pruftechnik VibXpert 2-Channel Vibration Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;When to use Phase Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Everyone needs phase analysis. A phase study should be made on problem machines when the source of the vibration is not clear or when it is necessary to confirm suspected sources of vibration. A phase study might include points measured only on the machine bearings or it can include points over the entire machine from the foundation up to the bearings. The following are examples of how phase can help analyze vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Soft Foot &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The term soft foot is used to describe machine frame distortion. It can be caused by a condition where the foot of a motor, pump or other component is not flat, square and tight to its mounting, or many other things, such as machining errors, bent or twisted feet and non-flat mounting surfaces. Soft foot increases vibration and puts undue stress on bearings, seals and couplings. Soft foot on a motor distorts the stator housing creating a non-uniform rotor to stator air gap resulting in vibration at two times line frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good laser shaft alignment system should be used to verify soft foot by loosening the machine feet one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Phase can be used to identify soft foot while the machine is in operation. Measure vertical phase between the foot and its mounting surface. If the joint is tight, the phase angle is the same between surfaces. If the phase angle is different by more than 20 degrees, the foot is loose or the machine frame is cracked or flimsy. Figure 8 is an example of the phase shift across a soft foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 8. A phase shift between the foot and mount may indicate soft foot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cocked Bearings and Bent Shafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect cocked bearings and bent shafts. Measure phase at four axial locations around the bearing housing. If the bearing is cocked or the shaft is bent through the bearing, the phase will be different at each location. If the shaft is straight and the bearing is not twisting, the phase will be the same at each location (Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 9. Phase identifies in-plane or twisting bearing motion.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Confirm Imbalance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A once-per-revolution radial vibration usually means rotor unbalance. Use phase to prove imbalance is the problem. To confirm imbalance, measure the horizontal and vertical phase on a shaft or bearing housing. If the difference between the phase values is approximately 90 degrees, the problem is rotor unbalance (Figure 10). If the phase difference is closer to zero or 180 degrees, the vibration is caused by a reaction force. An eccentric pulley and shaft misalignment are examples of reaction forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 10. Horizontal to Vertical Phase Shift of about 90 Degrees Confirms Unbalance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Looseness, Bending or Twisting &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Phase is used to detect loose joints on structures and bending or twisting due to weakness or resonance. To check for looseness, measure the vertical phase at each mechanical joint as indicated by the arrows in Figure 11. When joints are loose, there will be a phase shift of approximately 180 degrees. The phase angle will not change across a tight joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 11. A phase shift between bolted joints indicates looseness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shaft Misalignment &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Shaft misalignment is easily verified with phase. Measure each bearing in the horizontal, vertical and axial directions. Record the values in a table or bubble diagram as shown in Figure 12. Compare the horizontal phase from bearing to bearing on each component and across the coupling. Repeat the comparison using vertical then axial data. Good alignment will show no substantial phase shift between bearings or across the coupling. The machine in Figure 12 has a 180-degree phase shift across the coupling in the radial directions. The axial directions are in-phase across the machine. The data indicates parallel (offset) shaft misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 12. Phase Data Indicates Parallel Shaft Misalignment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operational Deflection Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Instead of comparing the phase and magnitude numbers from a table or bubble diagram, operational deflection shape software (ODS) can be used to animate a machine drawing. An ODS is a measurement technique used to analyze the motion of rotating equipment and structures during normal operation. An ODS is an extension of phase analysis where a computer-generated model of the machine is animated with phase and magnitude data or simultaneously measured time waveforms. The animation is visually analyzed to diagnose problems. ODS testing is able to identify a wide variety of mechanical faults and resonance issues such as looseness, soft foot, broken welds, misalignment, unbalance, bending or twisting from resonance, structural weakness and foundation problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 13 is a simple ODS of three direct-coupled shafts. Phase and magnitude were measured from permanently mounted X and Y displacement probes on a turbine generator. The values listed in the table were used in ODS software to animate a stick figure drawing of the high- and low-pressure turbine shafts and the generator shaft. The picture to the right of the table is a capture from the ODS animation showing the vibration pattern of each shaft and the relative motion between shafts at 3,600 cycles per minute (turning speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 13. Shaft Operational Deflection Shape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many machines vibrate due to deteriorated foundations, looseness, resonance of the support structure and other problems that occur below the machine bearings. A phase study might include hundreds of test points measured all over the machine and foundation. Good ODS software can make it easier to analyze phase and magnitude data from a large number of test points. Analysis of an ODS involves observation and interpretation of the machine in motion. Figure 14 is an ODS structure drawing of a vertical pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="style1" href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Ludeca_images100710.pdf"&gt;Figure 14. Vertical Pump Operational Deflection Shape Structure Drawing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition-based vibration testing is a vital component of a reliability based maintenance program. Vibration sensors, instruments and software are able to provide key information about machine health. The weak link in the chain is the analyst&amp;rsquo;s ability to interpret the data, accurately diagnose the problem and trend the fault until it is time to recommend corrective action. Phase analysis is a very powerful diagnostic tool. Every vibration analyst should be using phase to improve vibration analysis accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Arch Coal recognized for excellence in predictive maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal Inc. on September 22 announced that its predictive maintenance program has been named as the best overall program among mobile equipment fleets from around the world by an industrial trade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Earning the best predictive maintenance award is an important achievement for Arch Coal&amp;#39;s national network of mines,&amp;quot; said John W. Eaves, Arch&amp;#39;s president and chief operating officer. &amp;quot;The mining environment is very dynamic, which makes the maintenance of equipment an intense and challenging effort. That&amp;#39;s why our mining personnel value the recognition for their best-in-class practices that include managing risk and reducing exposure through planned, preventative and predictive maintenance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arch Coal&amp;#39;s predictive maintenance program employs certified maintenance engineers at each mining complex and standardized processes to provide comprehensive oil and vibration analysis, ultrasonic flaw detection, thermography and motor circuit analysis. This technology is used for quality standards and acceptance testing at component and rebuild facilities certified by Arch. According to Arch&amp;#39;s director of technical and maintenance services, Bob McCreary, Arch has reduced controllable maintenance costs by 5 percent annually over the last four years by integrating a comprehensive predictive maintenance program throughout its national network of mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	St. Louis-based Arch Coal, Inc. is the nation&amp;#39;s second-largest coal producer. The company&amp;#39;s core business is providing U.S. power generators with clean-burning, low-sulfur coal for electric generation. The company also ships coal to domestic and international steel manufacturers as well as international power producers. Through its national network of mines and 4,600-person workforce, Arch supplies the fuel for approximately 8 percent of the electricity generated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/Yd59B-fDGTE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Vibration analysis is like winning the lottery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ah, to be able to predict the winning numbers in a lottery &amp;ndash; who hasn&amp;rsquo;t had that dream! Life would be so easy and carefree with a crystal ball. And, would not your maintenance job be so much simpler if you could just identify machine damage in time and predict the point at which repairs really become necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to DIN 31051, condition-oriented maintenance is not limited to inspection, servicing, determination of the machine condition and maintenance scheduling. It also encompasses predicting the length of service life remaining for machines and systems. This means it is not always necessary to replace a rolling bearing when an inspection measurement reveals inner raceway frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article describes how it was possible to keep a damaged bearing running for several months until the scheduled annual outage came around &amp;ndash; naturally under close observation. Periodic measurements had shown that there had only been a slight change in the envelope spectrum. But one thing at a time &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In January, a contractor was awarded a contract for the mobile condition measurement of a double-shaft extruder gear. So, before the diagnostic specialist carries out measurements on location, the gear construction data is established by way of the factory number and the bearing frequencies are calculated for the entire drive (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca111.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this purpose, the contractor used a computer program that recognizes almost all gear types, including variable speed drives. Having calculated the excitation frequencies, the diagnostic specialist visits the customer to determine the current condition of the drive &amp;ndash; which in this case was already 7 years old &amp;ndash; and to find any deviations. Beginning bearing damage was identified during control measurement as a result of the distinct, albeit not yet critical, vibrations of an inner raceway frequency that were picked up in the input shaft area. The gear condition was recorded and the recommendation to procure replacement parts for the intermediate shaft was made to the operator. Repeated monthly measurements were recommended to assess whether the bearing needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows two envelope spectra that were recorded three months apart at the same measuring point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca112.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Measured Values Recorded at a Three-month Interval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because changes were only slight, an immediate replacement of the bearing was not deemed necessary, and the decision was made to continue operation until the scheduled annual outage. The bearing was exchanged five months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca113.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Dismantling the Intermediate Shaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon dismantling the bearing, the damage diagnosed on the inner raceway could be confirmed as expected &amp;ndash; nine months after initial diagnosis. Pittings are clearly visible on the inner raceway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/ludeca114.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Inner Raceway with Diagnosed Pitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The extruder was back in operation two days later as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In hindsight, both the diagnosis and the predicted remaining service time proved to be correct and economically wise. Expensive &amp;ldquo;crash repair&amp;rdquo; was unnecessary in this case. And, avoiding downtime was almost like picking a &amp;ldquo;winning number&amp;rdquo; in the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Researchers develop ultra-high-power energy storage devices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A team of researchers from the U.S. and France report the development of a mirco-supercapacitor with remarkable properties. The paper was published in the premier scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt; online on August 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These micro-supercapacitors have the potential to power nomad electronics, wireless sensor networks, biomedical implants, active radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags and embedded microsensors, among other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supercapacitors, also called electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) or ultracapacitors, bridge the gap between batteries, which offer high energy densities but are slow, and &amp;ldquo;conventional&amp;rdquo; electrolytic capacitors, which are fast but have low energy densities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The newly developed devices described in &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt; have powers per volume that are comparable to electrolytic capacitors, capacitances that are four orders of magnitude higher, and energies per volume that are an order of magnitude higher. They were also found to be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional supercapacitors, which are used in backup power supplies, wind power generators and other machinery. These new devices have been dubbed &amp;ldquo;micro-supercapacitors&amp;rdquo; because they are only a few micrometers (0.000001 meters) thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What makes this possible? &amp;ldquo;Supercapacitors store energy in layers of ions at high surface area electrodes,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Yury Gogotsi, Trustee Chair Professor of materials science and engineering at Drexel University, and a co-author of the paper. &amp;ldquo;The higher the surface area per volume of the electrode material, the better the performance of the supercapacitor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Vadym Mochalin, research assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Drexel and co-author, said, &amp;ldquo;We use electrodes made of onion-like carbon, a material in which each individual particle is made up of concentric spheres of carbon atoms, similar to the layers of an onion. Each particle is 6 to 7 nanometers in diameter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the first time a material with very small spherical particles has been studied for this purpose. Previously investigated materials include activated carbon, nanotubes, and carbide-derived carbon (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The surface of the onion-like carbons is fully accessible to ions, whereas with some other materials, the size or shape of the pores or of the particles themselves would slow down the charging or discharging process,&amp;rdquo; Mochalin said. &amp;ldquo;Furthermore, we used a process to assemble the devices that did not require a polymer binder material to hold the electrodes together, which further improved the electrode conductivity and the charge/discharge rate. Therefore, our supercapacitors can deliver power in milliseconds, much faster than any battery or supercapacitor used today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Drexel team of Gogotsi and Mochalin collaborated with Dr. David Pech, Dr. Magali Brunet, Hugo Durou, Peihua Huang, Dr. Pierre-Louis Taberna, and professor Patrice Simon, all working in Toulouse, France, on the Nature Nanotechnology paper. A grant from the Partner University Fund of the French-American Cultural Exchange allowed two of the Toulouse-based researchers, Pech and Huang, to spend a month each visiting Professor Gogotsi&amp;rsquo;s laboratory at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Additional exchange visits are planned for the 2010-2011 academic year. The effort at Drexel University is based upon work supported as part of the Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport (FIRST) Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under award no. ERKCC61.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>That's amore! Italian power plant loves new filter strategy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management&amp;rsquo;s AMS Suite: Equipment Performance Monitor is helping Centro Energia Teverola S.p.a. improve the efficiency of its 150-megawatt combined cycle co-generation power plant in Teverola, Italy. Using this combination of software and services has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to optimize its maintenance strategy for inlet filters on the gas turbines, contributing to an overall efficiency improvement of more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing that even a small increase in plant efficiency can provide a significant increase in operating profit, Centro Energia Teverola deployed AMS Performance Monitor to plan and monitor its maintenance practices, including evaluating the return on maintenance costs. An integral part of Emerson&amp;rsquo;s PlantWeb digital architecture, AMS Performance Monitor combines thermodynamic model-based software with support from Emerson experts to detect degraded machinery performance and aid predictive maintenance planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before Centro Energia Teverola adopted AMS Performance Monitor, unexpected performance degradation of the filters on gas turbines required emergency installation of replacement filters, resulting in costly downtime, especially during a peak production period. Emerson&amp;rsquo;s solution now monitors the gradual deterioration in filter performance and calculates the cost of the resulting reduction in turbine performance. By comparing this with the cost of the maintenance required, Centro Energia Teverola can determine the most appropriate point to replace the blocked filter. AMS Performance Monitor also makes it easy to establish the manpower required to complete individual maintenance projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance at the plant is now scheduled for periods when energy production is less profitable and penalties for being offline can be avoided. This improved planning also has enabled Centro Energia Teverola to reduce average repair times from seven hours to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With AMS Performance Monitor, the return on investment is very fast. A single filter change has already paid for this service for two years,&amp;rdquo; said Vincenzo Piscitelli, general manager, Centro Energia Teverola. &amp;ldquo;We can assess the effectiveness and economic return of our maintenance activities, which allows us to determine, in a strategic and effective way, what maintenance work is required to improve equipment performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a remote service, AMS Performance Monitor does not require complex hardware or software deployed on site. Instead, process data is sent to Emerson&amp;rsquo;s performance monitoring center of expertise, in Teesside, United Kingdom, where experienced engineers produce periodic reports showing monitored performance. These reports can be accessed via any standard Web browser and are based on thermodynamic models developed for each machine. In addition to the online information, Emerson also provides advice about the operational efficiency of machinery. Existing or potential problems are highlighted, as well as new opportunities to improve overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Emerson Process Management &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Motor categories that must meet NEMA Premium standards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in December 2010 the new Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) government regulations will change motor manufacturers requirements to meet NEMA Premium standards for NEMA and IEC frame sizes on motors less than 600 volts. We will be discussing this new&amp;nbsp;regulation in a five-part series of tips highlighting some of the issues that may impact you. Here is Part 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following motor categories must meet NEMA Premium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1 to 200 horsepower general purpose&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Polyphase design A &amp;amp; B to 600VAC&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TEFC, ODP, explosion proof&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brake motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEMA 140T frames to 449&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Foot mounted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		C-face foot mounted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Severe duty, washdown, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		IEC Metric 90 frames and larger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Static and dynamic testing as part of PdM programs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Predictive maintenance programs (PMPs) are becoming universally accepted as the best method for maintaining motor reliability within most modern plants and facilities. A complete PMP will include as many technologies as possible, with each technology providing vital pieces to the diagnostic puzzle. Periodic static testing and more aggressive dynamic testing of motors are essential parts of predicting the potential for a motor to continue a safe and successful operation. Tracking and trending the results of electric motor testing on a regular schedule is the most effective method of making intelligent predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The need for motor testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The steady, safe and efficient operation of electric motors is essential to the productivity of all plants and facilities. Some facilities have many critical and/or expensive motors. A motor failure could be catastrophic, causing lost production and costly emergency repairs. For example, a motor failure at a nuclear plant can cost up to $1 million a day for critical motors and may have a disastrous, long-lasting impact. Even failures at a wastewater treatment facility can have a huge, negative environmental effect and can be very costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motors fail due to numerous operational circumstances, including power condition, mechanical influences and environmental hazards. According to IEEE&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and EPRI&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; studies, at least 35 to 45 percent of motor failures are electrically related. Monitoring the motors &amp;ldquo;electrical health&amp;rdquo; is, unquestionably, an important and vital consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trending the historical operating condition of a motor makes early detection of any decline in the motors &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; possible. Planning downtime and having only minor reconditioning repairs instead of a major rewind or replacement is far less expensive in both repair costs and lost production. Since electric motors begin deteriorating the instant they are started, it is necessary to monitor their operating condition on a routine, periodic schedule. Periodic monitoring and trending of data collected and properly diagnosed provides the technician with evidence needed to prepare for downtime before a catastrophe occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is no longer practical to just &amp;ldquo;megger&amp;rdquo; a motor in order to determine its condition. Plants and facilities depend on a complete predictive maintenance program (PMP) to monitor their operations and plan their repair schedules. A good PMP requires both static (and off-line) and dynamic (or on-line) testing, with educated and trained technicians monitoring data routinely, with quality equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides voltages and currents, on-line test equipment must be able to capture and trend torque ripple and torque signatures as well as rotor bar sidebands. Off-line testing with modern, high-voltage test equipment is essential to getting reliable data. The voltages required to properly test motor windings cannot be reached with impedance-based or low-voltage test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective dynamic test equipment must be able to collect and trend all essential data that affects the operation of electric motors. Power condition &amp;ndash; including voltage level, voltage imbalance and harmonic distortions, current levels and current imbalances, load levels, torque signatures, rotor bar signatures, service factors and efficiencies &amp;ndash; should be tracked and trended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On-line testing is performed at the motor&amp;rsquo;s MCC, at the load side of a variable frequency drive or at an installed port, which allows for on-line testing without opening the MCC. Data is collected through a set of current transformers and corresponding voltage probes. The data collected, processed and analyzed provides the technician with an overall view of the normal operational environment to which the motor is subjected on a daily basis and of how the motor is responding within this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, a motor is subjected to incoming power problems including low or high voltages, voltage imbalances and harmonic distortions. Lower voltages cause higher currents and, therefore, more heat. Higher voltages cause lower power factors and ultimately higher losses. A small amount of voltage imbalance creates an exponential amount of current imbalance which causes temperature increases. Harmonic distortion also causes thermal stress in motors. Any of these voltage problems can cause severe overheating in the motor even without factually reaching an over-load situation, and excessive heat is the insulation&amp;rsquo;s major enemy. Some motors are subjected to physical obstacles that cause undue stress. Over-greasing, misalignment and over-tightened belts all cause thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many motor failures can be traced to load related situations. Erratic torque signatures can be an indicator of load-related problems. Broken or cracked rotor bars also can cause premature motor failures. On-line testing identifies these problems, and routine trending will reveal the rate of decline. Of major importance to the overall health of a motor also is the &amp;ldquo;effective service factor.&amp;rdquo; Two elements affect the service factor number are: real operating power condition (voltage quality) and steady state load conditions. The effective service factor number represents the thermal stress caused by these two conditions on the motor. On-line testing can find and trend all of these motor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing schedules should be tailored individually according to operating time, criticality and any other important element of operation. Generally, an on-line test should be performed at least quarterly. Motors that begin to show obvious decline or thermal over-stressing should be monitored more closely until the motor can be statically tested or removed from operation and repaired. New and recently repaired motors should be tested as soon as they are returned to service in order to provide a historical record (or baseline) of their performance when the motor is at its &amp;ldquo;best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Off-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In general, motors are quite reliable, and when properly maintained, you should expect at least 100,000 hours of continual operation. That is to say, a new motor operated within nameplate parameters should give us at least 11 years of steady use. Unfortunately, motors are almost always subjected to a variety of damaging elements, with the end result being a rise in operating temperature. Thermal aging of the insulation is the major cause of insulation failure. Years of testing and numerous studies have shown that, as a &amp;ldquo;rule of thumb,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;for every 10 degrees centigrade increase in temperature, the winding life is decreased in half.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides thermal problems, other causes of insulation failures include incoming line related problems. Spikes caused by lightning and surges created by switching and contactor closing contribute to insulation breakdown. Motors also are subjected to mechanical influences including bearing failure, environmental hazards and magnet wire damage caused during the manufacturing process. Even the physical movements of the windings during startups causes wear to the insulation system, especially the magnet-wire insulation, as D.E. Crawford has shown.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper testing of all components of a motor requires a series of tests designed to emulate the conditions the motor will see in the field. It has been proved in numerous studies that low-voltage testing, including capacitance, inductance, impedance, etc., are not effective tools in verifying insulation problems. Quality off-line test equipment will be able to perform winding resistance tests, insulation-resistance tests, high-potential (HiPot) tests, polarization index, and surge tests at IEEE, NEMA and EASA accepted standards. Top-quality test equipment will automatically run a series of preprogrammed tests and provide a complete final report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This automatic equipment will stop testing before any damage is done to the windings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resistance test verifies the existence of dead shorts within the turn-to-turn coils and shows any imbalances between phases due to turn count differences, along with locating poor wire connections or contacts and finds open parallel coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DC insulation resistance testing detects faults in ground wall insulation or motors that have already failed to ground. Weak ground wall insulation (prior to copper-to-ground failure) can only be found successfully with the HiPot tests. The ground wall insulation system consists of the magnet wires insulation, slot liner insulation, wedges, varnish and often phase paper. DC HiPot test should be performed at twice line voltage plus 1,000 volts since motors will see voltage spikes of at least that level during each startup. HiPot testing is necessary to verify winding suitability for continued service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Surge testing detects faults in both inter-turn winding and phase-to-phase insulation systems. Turn-to-turn faults will not be seen by a megger or HiPot test. Potential faults can only be seen when the coils see more than 350 volts from turn-to-turn or coil-to-coil, as described by Paschen&amp;rsquo;s Law &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Figure 1). The typical mechanism of fault progression is a turn-to-turn short, causing excessive heat and progressing within seconds or minutes to copper to ground faults. Faults are much more likely to occur between turn-to-turn winding coils due to the added stress caused by bending and exaggerated during the winding process. The ground wall insulation is generally many times stronger and more capable of withstanding voltage spikes and other stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Integrating on-line and off-line testing into a predictive maintenance program provides the technician with verification of his motor&amp;rsquo;s condition (see case studies below). Both technologies are necessary in order to have a complete picture of a motor&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Collecting both on-line and off-line data on a routine schedule allows for early warning of impending failures and opens the opportunity window for planned downtime. Performing resistance, HiPot and surge testing along with dynamic testing provides the technician with a total picture of the motor&amp;rsquo;s condition and allows him or her to track its rate of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern test equipment includes enhanced and detailed reporting. Reports are easily generated, providing a written hard copy of test results and making diagnosing and comparing of data clearer and more accurate. Setting up and managing a program to monitor the motors within any facility is essential to insure the safe and continued operation and production of the facility. In most cases, a properly managed and operated PMP will save a plant or facility much more than it will cost to implement, administer and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	1) At a large wastewater treatment facility in Florida, 14 identical motors were scheduled for predictive maintenance. These motors were 40-horsepower aerators for a large treatment tank and operated continuously. Static tests were performed on all 14, and each received passing marks on all tests. When dynamic testing was complete, it was noted that 13 motors were acting very similar running within expected parameters at approximately 85 percent load, while the 14th motor was running at just over 30 percent load. Further inspection revealed a sheared coupling on the motor running at reduced load. The operators had no way of detecting the problem, and the location of these motors made visual inspection difficult. The dynamic testing found a problem that was costing the customer both in wasted kilowatt usage and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Twelve 60-horsepower pump/motors were tested at a large office building. Six were chilled water pump/motors and six were condenser water circulating pump/motors. All 12 were installed at the same time and ran continuously. Dynamic testing was performed one day on all 12, and all appeared to be operating within expected parameters. The motors were shut down for a scheduled annual routine building maintenance, and static testing was planned for the following morning. Resistance tests appeared normal on all, but two would not pass HiPot testing at the preset voltage. Three others failed the surge tests. The five motors were removed from service, disassembled and inspected. Two were found to be extremely dirty, while three had no visual damage. All five were reconditioned, retested and replaced in service. The off-line testing prevented five potential catastrophic failures and allowed the customer to dictate the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Increasing wind farm profitability by reducing gearbox maintenance costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As much as 30 percent of wind farm operating and maintenance costs are associated with gearbox maintenance alone. Reducing these costs can help wind farms stay more profitable, efficient, and competitive, bringing clean energy wind farms to the forefront. GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Condition-Based Maintenance Solution, including GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Bently Nevada ADAPT.wind Software, reduces gearbox maintenance costs and provides wind farms with a greater competitive edge in the energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Bently Nevada integrated condition monitoring system enables operators to understand the gearbox condition remotely. Dependable knowledge of the gearbox condition enables continued operation and revenue generation when a defect is not significant, while mitigating the risk of run to failure, an unplanned outage, or catastrophic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proactive condition monitoring across the fleet also helps operators plan efficiently for and coordinate maintenance outages. Consolidating maintenance into one outage, and scheduling one crane, can save hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per year in lost revenue, depending on the size of the wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s patented Planetary Cumulative Impulse Detection algorithm is a set of measurements that detect and trend the passage of particulates through the planetary stage of a wind turbine gearbox. This provides greater insight into gearbox condition and helps pinpoint problem areas. GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Dynamic Energy Index (DEI) algorithm is specifically designed for variable speed machines. DEI spreads the variation over five bands of operation for more accurate spectral energy calculations and earlier fault detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring Solution is part of ADAPT.wind, the standard condition monitoring solution on GE&amp;rsquo;s wind turbine units that can be readily deployed on most manufacturers&amp;rsquo; ~1.5-megawatt-class turbines. Turbine owners can expect to see cost savings through several venues including reducing unplanned crane services and optimizing maintenance. The incredible value and benefit in implementing this solution has been acknowledged as many companies are adopting condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies to decrease down time, reduce cost and improve reliability. This solution already has more than 700 units in the order and installation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/condition_monitoring/~4/rHTNoowoNP4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						A large steel mill wanted to make every machine ready for easy oil sampling. After installing more than 1,200 new oil sampling ports, it began getting strange data on oil analysis reports. After investigating, it found that each of the new sampling ports was installed in the wrong location.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						A company that had been using oil analysis for several years wondered why it was never able to detect pending bearing failures. After a bearing failure shut down production for more than a day, it discovered that the oil analysis tests being conducted were not capable of detecting impending failure. Instead, the tests were designed to identify wrong or degraded lubricants only.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Creating a lean but effective oil analysis program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a budget issue, management buy-in, lack of individuals or just a small company with limited funds, there are ways to establish an effective oil analysis program with minimal startup and operation costs. In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll read case studies on alternatives to expensive in-house test equipment, good utilization of outside labs, oil storage solutions, methods of reporting findings to further the program, selling the program to upper management as well as to operations and maintenance, and starting over again when your facility is sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This article will cover the steps I experienced setting up our oil analysis program, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purpose of an oil analysis program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our attempts to set up a state-of-the-art program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		My course of action after management turned down our original plan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment employed in a lean oil analysis program&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Current program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of an oil analysis program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In my opinion, reliability is the No. 1 reason we perform predictive maintenance. Uptime is the only way to compete in today&amp;rsquo;s highly competitive world. Detecting problems and preventing failures are ways to get the most uptime possible from our equipment. Along with uptime, reducing cost is also important to the profitability of any company. If an equipment problem can be detected early, it can be scheduled for repair or replacement before it causes expensive downtime or equipment damage. The ultimate goal would be to run each component as long as possible and be able to predict in advance when it needs to be changed. This also includes the oil. More and more, the oil is becoming a very expensive component of any piece of equipment; getting the longest life you can out of oil is no different than a bearing or a gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cost of a predictive maintenance program also adds to production costs and is scrutinized more than other expenses, as it is not looked at as being directly related to production. Unlike vibration and thermography, oil analysis usually requires an outside lab to perform the tests for analyzing the samples. It is imperative to show success early and it must be communicated quickly not only to management but also to production and maintenance. Getting support from production and maintenance will go a long way in selling management on spending money for the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So if you are a small company with not a lot of capital to work with, a larger company dealing with cost control, no support of the predictive maintenance by management or, in some cases, there is a combination of issues that keep you from starting or maintaining a predictive maintenance program, success can be achieved with a little determination and a little thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To start with, I will give you a little history on how I had to set up a lean oil analysis program, what led to it, how it progressed and the success achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Our attempt at a world-class program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In my case, the problems kept changing as our company grew and then was sold twice. At the beginning, we were set up to be a fully cross-craft maintenance, and every technician would be an expert in every aspect of maintenance, including predictive. Everyone was given some basic training on vibration, alignment and oil analysis. It was very evident to us that only certain techs were interested in each of the disciplines, but everyone was expected to complete whatever work order they were given. This produced very erratic trending and even worse analysis of the data. Many motors, bearings and reducers were diagnosed incorrectly, wasting labor, materials and reducing reliability. Management was still sold on having everyone as an expert in every discipline of maintenance. To achieve this, they planned to send two techs at a time to training. Fortunately, the first two sent to vibration as well as the two sent to oil analysis training were passionate about the process. They took ownership of each of the programs and were able to achieve some early success, but no one was allowed to be a dedicated predictive maintenance tech; we still had every maintenance tech collecting data and doing the analysis. Whenever there was an alarm condition, the reply was, &amp;ldquo;Change the oil,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Change the motor,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Run it and watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The change began when two of the people picked for the original training &amp;ndash; one oil analysis and one vibration &amp;ndash; decided to take matters into their own hands. Thinking back to what made us do this behind management&amp;rsquo;s back, it had to be a passion for the predictive maintenance process, or maybe just the thrill of getting away with something. Some of the original group trained in oil analysis and vibration lost interest in the programs because management wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to invest in the equipment needed or staff the program full time. Even after putting together a proposal that showed all the benefits and payback of a full-fledged program, management maintained their philosophy of a full cross-craft maintenance department with no specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Before Picture of Clarion Boards&amp;#39; Oil Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Change of plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another train of thought was to go slow and convince management through results. The methods used were a little different and required some risk, going behind the back of management, but they had encouraged us to be a self-directed workforce. All techs at our mill were on-shift and worked 12-hour rotating shifts. Management works straight days and no weekends, which left us to manage ourselves nights and weekends. This gave us a great opportunity to get our oil analysis programs set up using non-traditional means. I would get my scheduled work done as quickly as possible or recruit the other techs on my shift to help out with the scheduled work so I could spend a little time each shift on the setup of the program. I also volunteered to perform all oil change preventive maintenance (PM) tasks on down days. This provided me the opportunity to design and install oil sampling ports on all of our equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During this process, we found some support from our corporate office. We started asking questions of the industrial training department, which sparked some interest in what we were doing, and questions were asked of our supervisors about progress. For example, they wanted to know how many sampling points we had for our vibration and how many sampling ports were installed on equipment for oil analysis. When my supervisor was given a pat on the back for having 150 sampling ports installed in equipment, he was surprised and confused and wanted to know how this was achieved without him knowing. After seeing the interest corporate showed, he began the process of dedicating a couple of techs to the predictive maintenance process. He ran into the same resistance with mill management that we had in the past (no specialist), but because pressure was being applied from corporate, his proposal was pushed through, with some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan agreed on by the managers at our facility was a three-month, three-person team to work day shift, to set up and start the PdM program. After three months, three more techs would be brought off-shift, and they would continue with the program. This rotation would continue with our entire maintenance staff. Only three people applied for the positions; the rest knew that management was only doing this because of corporate pressure and would not give the program support needed to succeed. After accepting the position and listening to the rules and restrictions, we went to work developing the program with one goal in mind &amp;ndash; no matter what obstacles they gave us, we would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were told right away that there would be no money for the PdM program. We had to use the equipment and resources we already had. Our first goal was to use what tools we had to show success as quickly as we could. Working with the oil supplier, which gave us free oil testing (which turned out to be worth exactly what we paid for), I spent my time working on perfecting the data-collection process. Keeping the samples clean and getting them to the lab quickly gave me somewhat of a stable trend on most of the equipment. Having one person collect all the data gave us a more stable trend as opposed to having every maintenance tech collect the data. On most of the equipment, I was able to get a nice trend except for the lab deviations &amp;ndash; the free oil-testing thing. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into that a little later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My next step was to develop a report where we could show all of our success and savings for the company. I used very conservative figures when estimating the money saved or downtime averted. I would make sure the report was sent to management as well as maintenance and process techs. To promote the program, I also forwarded the reports to the industrial training center at our corporate headquarters, which, with their help, went on up the ladder. This created some issues with our plant management, but it secured our place because they could not justify shutting us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the quickest ways to show a savings turned out to be a benefit from having so many sampling ports installed in our equipment. Every reducer, from the largest to the smallest, as well as every hydraulic and lube system had a sampling port installed. Samples could be taken while the equipment was running. I was able to set up all of this equipment for condition-based oil changes. The OEM-recommended oil changes for the majority of our hydraulic system came due about this same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using the lab results, I was able to show that all of the hydraulic oil in the systems was as good as new. The total oil for these systems was more than 900 gallons. To this day, 11 years after startup, we are still running with the original fill on the hydraulic systems. Going to condition-based oil changes reduced our oil consumption by about 70 percent in the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The oil storage room became my room as no one else wanted to take ownership of the mess. We had a separate building attached to the side of our plant just for storing our oil. This room became a hiding place for everything messy. Some of our systems produced a lot of waste oil contaminated with wood fiber as part of the process. This waste along with other waste oil was everywhere in the storage building, along with our new oil and containers used to fill systems. I had to take charge of the oil room if I was going to have any success with the oil analysis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of our sister mills had an oil storage system that consisted of storage tanks built into a nice racking system with hoses and pumps to transfer and keep the oils clean. My purchase request for this system was turned down, so I set out to use what we had and, using some ideas from Noria training, designed my own storage system. Adding legs to the drum rack system we had, I set out to clean up the oil storage room. I was able to purchase a new waste oil tank as well as some storage cabinets and over time purchased dedicated oil transfer containers. The finished oil room (Figure 2) eventually became the standard for the entire company, including our sister mill. They had to give up their fancy storage system and replace it with this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Oil Room After Taking Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I set my sights on improving sampling, testing and analysis. I had approximately 100 samples to take each month to keep a close watch on our equipment and to manage the condition-based oil changes of all our equipment. This meant that we would run out of our free samples in about five months. I projected out what it would then cost to continue the program for the other seven months of the year. Particle count testing was not part of the free sample deal, and there would be a charge for this test to be added to the package for all samples. As I mentioned earlier, our free lab service we had with our oil supplier was worth exactly what we paid for it. Now we were going to have to pay for the tests, particle count for the first 500 and then full price for all samples after that. I needed to find out if the lab service they offered was going to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having all the data collected by one person, the trending started to level out, but I was still seeing test results at times that were all over the place. Unable to contact the lab, except through our oil representative, I decided to run a simple test to see how reliable the results were that we were getting from the lab. After pulling enough oil from a new drum of oil to make four samples, I sent them into the lab for testing. Before separating the oil into four bottles, I thoroughly agitated the oil. The results I got back were all different. Particle counts, viscosity and additives results were all over the place. I ran this same test in qualifying an independent lab. I picked the lab with the best repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still not having a budget to work with, I put together a proposal that would get us some in-house testing, along with support of an independent lab with very little investment. I compared the cost of a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Full in-house lab with all the necessary equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An independent lab doing all the lab work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Our current system projecting out the fact that we would run through our free samples half way through the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These all turned out to be very expensive and were all turned down by management. I started looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lean equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If I could come up with a way to do some in-house testing and only use an outside lab for very critical and questionable samples, I would get more useful data at a lower cost. The criteria I set for my in-house test equipment was repeatability, ease of use and being able to perform tests quickly. Repeatability would be the biggest factor. Knowing that every test was accurate was a must. The three tests I felt were needed to have an effective in-house program were viscosity, particle count and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Viscosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Viscosity can be measured using a visgage, a handheld unit with two tubes each containing a steel ball. One of the tubes is filled with a reference fluid; the other can be filled with the fluid to be tested. After tipping the gauge to get the balls to the one end, the gauge is held at a 45-degree angle until one of the balls reaches the end of the gauge scale; the other ball will indicate the viscosity of the fluid. When sending out a sample to the lab, I would use the visgage and record the data and compare it with the test results from the lab. I was surprised how accurate the visgage was with a little practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lander003.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Two visgages were purchased through an online auction &amp;ndash; one in centistokes and the other in Saybolt seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Patch test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After reading an article about patch tests, I decided to look into what equipment was needed, how accurate the tests were and if the results were repeatable. I also needed a way to trend data viewed in the patch. I found a microscope on the Internet that had a digital camera that connected to a personal computer. With the camera attachment, I was able to save the patch images and trend any changes. I also found that a top light is necessary to see and identify particles on the patch. A small handheld magnet moved alongside the microscope would make the ferrous metals dance. Using the top and the bottom lights and either the 100 times or 400 times lenses helps to identify the type of wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before testing a sample, it needs to be agitated. I found very early on that the proper agitation of the sample makes a big difference in the accuracy and repeatability of the tests. I priced commercial agitators and found them to be quite expensive. Our vibration tech made a vibration training station from a discarded reducer and an old motor. The output of the reducer turned very slow, attaching a wheel to hold the sample bottles; the slow rotation agitated the samples as well as any vibrating shaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The patch test became the backbone of my program. I used the patch to check the sample for contamination, wear debris and to perform a rudimentary particle count. Using the digital image to store and trend the collected data made it easier to detect a change in the equipment condition. If something out of the ordinary is observed, then the sample can be sent to the lab. Because the patch test uses so little of the sample, there is still enough left to send to a lab for further testing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are patch test atlases available to assist in the identifying of contamination and wear debris. Actual images of the different types of wear debris can help you identify what you are seeing in the microscope. To get a feel for estimating the particle content of a fluid, I would send the sample off to the lab and compare my estimate to the actual from the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I found two methods to make patches. One consisted of a funnel-shaped patch holder that used gravity or a vacuum to run the fluid through the patch. This worked well but had several issues: time, cleanup and exposure. Using gravity to get the fluid through the patch took time and was very dependent on having the right amount of thinning fluid added to the sample to make it thin enough to go through the patch. Cleaning the funnel between tests not only required time but could also affect the next sample if any residue is left. Pouring, mixing and the time the sample is exposed to the air can affect patch results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second method, using a syringe with a two-way check valve, solved all of the issues I had with the funnel method. With the two-way check valve, I can draw up the right amount of oil and then thin fluid in the syringe as well as push it through the patch with minimal exposure to the atmosphere. Cleaning the syringe is very easy and quick, in addition to purging all fluid and contamination quickly using the same method. It only takes a few minutes to create a patch ready for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Moisture test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Testing oil for water can also be simply done in-house. Water in the systems I test in-house is not as critical as those I send to the lab. Small reducers running under normal load can handle a small amount of moisture without too much trouble. However, for reliability checking to make sure moisture is not an issue, I use the crackle test. A couple drops of oil placed on a hot plate set to the right temperature will give you a quick check for the presence of water. Having a magnifying light over the hot plate not only protects you from the hot oil but also gives you a better view of the test. I also have used this in emergency tests for our critical equipment to test for a cooling water leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The in-house test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A typical oil sample would go through the following steps after collection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Visual test: &lt;/strong&gt;Look at the color and clarity of the oil. For this purpose, I use clear bottles only. I have a rack of new oil samples handy for comparison and record any change in color. Loss of clarity can indicate contamination by water, wear particles, dirt or wrong top off oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Smell test:&lt;/strong&gt; This can reveal issues with contamination, oxidation and varnish. Samples of new oil come in handy for this test as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Viscosity: &lt;/strong&gt;Use the visgage to test the viscosity and record the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Crackle test:&lt;/strong&gt; Deposit a couple of drops from the visgage unto the hot plate and check for water in the oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Patch test:&lt;/strong&gt; Produce a patch and analyze. Check for ferrous metals, using a magnet, and record the amount and size of particles. Look for and record the amount of other contaminants on the patch. Save the image to a database for trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Report: &lt;/strong&gt;This is probably one of the most important parts of keeping the program running. Reporting findings and successes will generate a lot of interest in the program. Keep reports short and to the point. Usually only the first page of a report gets read, so try to keep it to one page and cover your successes. I found that sending the reports to management to process helps in keeping everyone aware of the success of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Starting over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Shortly after getting everything working well and getting experience with the equipment, we were shut down. Market issues caused the shutdown, which lasted 18 months. When we were finally sold, half of the maintenance techs did not return. In September 2004, we restarted the mill; and to this day, we are still trying to restaff our maintenance department. Again, I have to start over-selling the importance of oil analysis to management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Finding the right person for the job is key to success. To make it work in a lean environment requires someone who is dedicated and has a passion for the process of oil analysis. Currently, I am still looking for the right person to fill this position &amp;ndash; someone who is willing to take ownership of the oil storage, take charge of the setting up the sampling, testing and reporting as well as someone who can think outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Datastick announces machine vibration seminar in California July 20-23</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A four-day Machine Vibration seminar with hands-on practical experience will be held on July 20 through 23 in San Jose, Calif. Attendees can become certified as Level I vibration analysts by taking a test on the last day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analyzing the vibration of rotating and reciprocating machinery provides an early warning system that alerts maintenance and reliability managers to machine health problems to help avoid costly, sudden breakdowns. Datastick&amp;rsquo;s handheld VSA Vibration Spectrum Analyzer will be used in the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four-day seminar includes hands-on practice as well as training on the basics of vibration, such as: what is an FFT; waveform vs. spectrum; an introduction to spectrum analysis; when and how to use the displacement, velocity and acceleration domains; and how to set up and manage inspection routes. Also covered are: effective sensor placement, onsite troubleshooting, detection of unbalance, eccentric rotors, gear wear and bearing failure, as well as how to measure vibration, create reports, and analyze the results to determine the likely cause of machine function problems such as resonance, rotor bar issues, and more. A full agenda can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.datastick.com/training"&gt;www.datastick.com/training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, predictive maintenance and Reliability-Centered Maintenance programs are replacing run-to-failure methods &amp;ndash; as well as preventive maintenance methods that were based on taking a piece of equipment offline for costly service, regardless of condition, after a certain number of hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hands-on practical experience is important to effective training, and this seminar provides it,&amp;rdquo; said Penny Melrose, CEO of Datastick Systems. &amp;ldquo;The Datastick VSA is an excellent tool for someone new to vibration because of its extremely fast learning curve and exceptional ease of use, along with full analysis comparable to or better than some analyzers at more than double the cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The course and exam meet the ISO 18436-2 and the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) SNT-TC-1A standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Datastick Systems Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Datastick Systems is a leading provider of cost-effective, innovative handheld vibration analysis and portable machine balancing systems.

            <title>UE launches Ultraprobe 15,000 Touch</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Using knowledge based on three decades of experience, the engineers at UE Systems have developed an entire ultrasonic condition monitoring laboratory &amp;ndash; to fit in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip on spectral band alarms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When reviewing spectral data rich with peaks from an unknown origin, consider establishing band alarms around these peaks. Properly designed and applied band alarms allow varied severity indications for a range of frequencies. If the application being monitored is operating in an otherwise healthy condition, then an increase of 25 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent from baseline could be used for observe, caution and severe setpoints, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pet food manufacturer focuses on eliminating failures</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Have you ever struggled with the need to make technology upgrades while minimizing risk, avoiding plant shutdowns and maximizing return on investment? If so, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Hill&amp;rsquo;s Pet Nutrition recognized a need to upgrade its existing I/O system in 2006 at its Kentucky plant to eliminate periodic failures involving the analog inputs. The company implemented control technology based on the Allen-Bradley &lt;a href="http://www.ab.com/programmablecontrol/pac/controllogix/controller.html" target="_blank"&gt;ControlLogix&lt;/a&gt; programmable automation controller (PAC) from Rockwell Automation with little downtime. The technology migration also helped eliminate I/O failures and streamline software programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Founded more than 50 years ago by a veterinarian, Hill&amp;rsquo;s pet food products are available in 86 countries, with sales of more than $1 billion. The company has more than 150 veterinarians, nutritionists and food scientists on staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The periodic failures involving the analog inputs meant maintenance would have to go out to the I/O rack, unplug the card and reconnect it so that the module would start working again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All of our process control for the extruder line is communicated through the analog input, so when that communication fails, it essentially shuts down the process,&amp;rdquo; says Shane Simmons, systems engineer at Hill&amp;rsquo;s Pet Nutrition. &amp;ldquo;Once the extruder line shuts down, it can take up to an hour-and-a-half to reconfigure the system and bring the process back online.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, finding replacement cards was becoming more difficult because the vendor was no longer making them. The only other option was to have them repaired, potentially adding delays and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hill also was concerned about disparate controllers on its raw materials, extrusion and packaging lines as well as dual controllers on its batching line used to maintain a tight tolerance on its ingredient mixing process. Unreliable service, declining operator knowledge, and increasing maintenance and support costs were pointing to a strong case for a control system migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With the ongoing reliability issues from our I/O system and the existing controllers nearing the end of their technology life cycle, we realized it was time for a major upgrade of both platforms,&amp;rdquo; Simmons explains. &amp;ldquo;We needed a flexible, high-performance control system that could be integrated into our existing infrastructure with minimal impact, and provide a technology framework that would allow us to grow well into the future while protecting our past investment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the biggest challenge was determining how to implement a simultaneous upgrade of both platforms while minimizing the impact on production. Engineers determined that the best strategic approach would be to implement the upgrade as part of a multiphase process, especially considering the plant&amp;rsquo;s intense production demands and the potential impact on multiple lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hill&amp;rsquo;s decided to migrate to Rockwell Automation and its ControlLogix PAC. A key factor in the decision was the ability of the ControlLogix PAC to scan existing I/O cards while also communicating with other controllers in the plant. This solution offered Hill&amp;rsquo;s a cost-efficient way to convert its existing I/O to the Allen-Bradley &lt;a href="http://www.ab.com/io/incabinet/1794.html"&gt;Flex I/O&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;platform as part of a multiphase implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first phase began in early 2008 with the conversion of the first of its four extruder lines to ControlLogix PAC technology. Engineers simply unplugged I/O from the existing system and plugged it into the ControlLogix PAC to test it on weekends. Then, the engineers would plug it back into the original system with minimal impact on production during the week. This helped minimize the downtime required while allowing a phased upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;That was probably one of the biggest factors that sold this project,&amp;rdquo; Simmons says. &amp;ldquo;Implementing this conversion did not require taking the line down for a minimum of six months to a year to replace more than 10 I/O racks, which would be completely unacceptable for our operation due to the high cost of downtime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standardization Supports Plant-Wide Integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The upgrade to the ControlLogix PAC also will allow&amp;nbsp;the plant to move toward standardizing on EtherNet/IP network communication. Currently the plant maintains multiple networks, including DeviceNet, Modbus Plus and Data Highway Plus. Narrowing these down to a single network architecture will help the plant simplify maintenance and troubleshooting, and lead to better plant-wide integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Migration enablers also played a key role in the Hill&amp;rsquo;s phased approach. The two migration enablers used were supplied by participating Encompass Product Partners in the Rockwell Automation PartnerNetwork: the Automation Network X-change (AN-X) module from Quest Technical Solutions, and the Modbus Plus dual-port communications module by ProSoft Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AN-X module serves as a database for all the I/O and ControlLogix PAC interface, linking and mapping them together in a seamless fashion. This module, which replaced an existing I/O scanner, automatically reads all of the I/O card information and passes the information to the ControlLogix PAC via Ethernet, providing plant-wide communication capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It also offers new tags that can be imported into the Rockwell Software &lt;a href="http://www.rockwellautomation.com/rockwellsoftware/design/rslogix5000/whatsnew.html"&gt;RSLogix&lt;/a&gt; 5000 programming software. This allows for easier reference to specific I/O data in the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Modbus Plus dual-port communications module acts as an I/O module between the existing Modbus Plus network and the ControlLogix controller backplane. This helps provide easier access to processor memory for data transfer between process and module. A 4,000-word register space in the module exchanges data between the ControlLogix PAC and the existing network, allowing the ControlLogix PAC platform to connect directly on to the existing network as a peer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ladder logic is used for data transfer between module and PAC. Configuration data is obtained through user-defined ladder. Other potential Hill&amp;rsquo;s applications include connecting ControlLogix controllers to Modicon controllers, and connecting Modbus Plus-speaking devices such as drives, relays and power monitor hardware to the Rockwell Automation controller backplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The continued upgrade of the first extruder line will involve converting the existing controller to the ControlLogix PAC, along with about 10 I/O racks to the FLEX I/O platform. The existing Modbus Plus network will eventually be replaced with EtherNet/IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, as variable-frequency drives in the plant are updated, they will be replaced with Allen-Bradley &lt;a href="http://www.rockwellautomation.com/go/tjpf70/"&gt;PowerFlex&lt;/a&gt; 70 drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By reducing its I/O reliability issues and reducing downtime, the plant anticipates about a 5 percent productivity increase. In addition, the high-speed processing capabilities of the ControlLogix PAC will allow the plant to replace the two controllers on its batching line with a single controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valuable Programming Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After implementing the ControlLogix PACs, the plant will have access to local support in Bowling Green, Ky., through its local Authorized Allen-Bradley Distributor, as well as through the Rockwell Automation support capabilities. This is especially crucial when it comes to programming support for the standard RSLogix 5000 programming package used with the ControlLogix PACs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Finding a knowledgeable programmer on short notice can be a challenge, especially in this area of the country,&amp;rdquo; Simmons says. &amp;ldquo;Locating programmers for Allen-Bradley controllers has been a much easier proposition &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ll have a lot more options now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The RSLogix 5000 software features add-on instructions, which allow engineers to create sets of commonly used custom instructions that can be easily reused without modification. This lets the plant create standardized libraries that can help reduce programming time and provide consistency to help simplify troubleshooting and reduce training costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Different contractors working on multiple processors throughout the plant resulted in a variety of software code being developed over the years, which increased programming complexity and the need for more specialized software expertise,&amp;rdquo; Simmons says. &amp;ldquo;Now when we program across the plant, more of our code will look the same, providing engineers with more standardized instructions and greater consistency between systems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the tag-based programming inherent in RSLogix 5000 software will allow the plant to keep its current I/O wiring configuration in place without changing a lot of field devices. This will help save a major amount of configuration time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next Step in the Migration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With ControlLogix PACs, we&amp;rsquo;re confident that we now have a stable, long-term migration path that will allow us to protect our investment and scale the technology to meet our long-term needs,&amp;rdquo; Simmons explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The upgrade project will be implemented in phases over five years and will involve upgrading a minimum of six of the plant&amp;rsquo;s existing controllers, including a distributed control system (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLC) and motion controllers, to the ControlLogix PAC platform. The upgrade will involve all of the plant&amp;rsquo;s major production lines, including four extruder lines, a raw ingredients line, batching line and packaging line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also is using this project as a model for its other plants, including a new plant in Emporia, Kan. that will be based on the ControlLogix PAC technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This project is the proving ground for that plant since they are incorporating a lot of our specifications and following very closely what we&amp;rsquo;re doing at this site,&amp;rdquo; Simmons says. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re leading the way in terms of defining our new technology roadmap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>IEEE members use remote sensing to promote a sustainable future</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	IEEE, the world&amp;#39;s largest technical professional association, and its members are applying engineering and technology principles to address issues of global environmental impact, including monitoring natural disasters and tracking man-induced hazards such as forest fires, oil spills and other types of chemical contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By utilizing remote sensing technology to monitor behavior on the ground, as well as in the atmosphere and water, IEEE members are addressing a number of environmental and safety concerns through the application of earth observation research. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		observing the ocean floor to sense and detect earthquakes;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		calculating measurements of plate tectonics to help the agriculture industry better assess soil quality;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		examining the Arctic Circle&amp;#39;s ecosystem of ice formations and weather patterns to provide the shipping industry with critical safety information; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		enhancing radar devices used to find victims of natural disasters, such as avalanches and earthquakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We rely heavily on remote sensing to collect data on ocean and atmospheric systems that would otherwise be inaccessible,&amp;quot; said Dr. Howard Michel, Senior Member, IEEE. &amp;quot;The technology has revolutionized the way in which we view the Earth, and monitor, predict and respond to otherwise catastrophic events.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IEEE Committee on Earth Observations (ICEO) and the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) are both deeply involved in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), a complex system of sensors, communication devices, storage systems, computational and other devices used to observe the Earth and gather data. The development of standards by ICEO and GRSS ensures that remote sensing techniques are being used universally to acquire the global data that is necessary for understanding the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IEEE members from around the world who are driving key earth observation initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dr. Ross Norman Chapman, IEEE Fellow and professor of ocean, earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of British Columbia, Canada, is a leading expert in seismo-acoustic propagation. His research, which focuses on the geophysical properties of the ocean floor, has contributed to the development of technologies that can be used to sense and detect the size, duration and strength of natural disasters and hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dr. Valery Zavorotny, IEEE Fellow and researcher with the Earth Systems Research Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S., collaborated in the soil-moisture experiment between NASA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture&amp;#39;s Agricultural Research Service and academia, measuring plate tectonics and geological processes to assess snowpack, soil moisture and vegetation moisture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dr. David Daniels, IEEE Fellow and head of sensor systems, ERA Technology, United Kingdom, is recognized for his work in ground-penetrating radar. Dr. Daniels has brought various mine-detecting products to the military and commercial enterprises. His systems are used for homeland security, crime prevention and the detection of missing individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Georg Heygster, IEEE member, is an environmental physicist in Germany observing the earth with satellites. His research on sea ice and weather help to improve weather prediction, climate research and ship safety.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Professor Ya-Qiu Jin, IEEE Fellow and member of IEEE GRSS, has been leading the Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information at Fudan University, China, to carry out extensive research programs on the fundamentals and applications of microwave remote sensing on the global environment, including atmosphere, ocean and terrain surface hydrology.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dr. Yun Shao, IEEE member in China who works with the IEEE GRSS, is studying the possibility of earthquake signal detection through the use of space and ground observation technology in the microwave spectrum.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dr. Diane Evans, IEEE Fellow and director for the Earth, Science and Technology Directorate, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, U.S., conducted research in the remote sensing industry that paved the way for advancing technologies in oceanography, the study of atmospheric composition and geophysics. She helped develop remote sensing techniques for earth surface geology using combined data sets from visible, infrared and radar satellites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About IEEE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audible, visual and tactile inspections for PdM personnel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is the backbone of any vibration monitoring effort, yet opportunities to gather additional data while at the machine are typically ignored. Is the vibration industry finally beginning to feel the effects of the pure data collector who has not transitioned into the reliability group from the mechanical trades? What about the site operators and craftsman? This paper covers basic inspection techniques that can be applied to optimize time spent in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many organizations separate personnel who perform technology monitoring into a predictive maintenance (PdM) team or reliability group. Their job is to periodically collect machinery information using various forms of technology and use this data to assess the condition of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Different technologies exist for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical components, and especially for detecting impending failure. Each technology has it own applications, advantages and disadvantages. Effective condition monitoring makes use of multiple techniques and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An under-utilized group of checks that provide valuable data are basic visual, audible and tactile inspections. These inspections can be performed and used to supplement the formal technology inspections. The key to successful implementation of a visual, audible and tactile inspection program is training the participants on the basic operation of the component to be inspected and following a list of items to be checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition monitoring steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective condition monitoring programs consist of four major elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Detection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to thoroughly understand each of these elements. Valuable time is too often wasted when too much emphasis is placed on any one component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many problems can be found using visual, audible and tactile inspections. The goal is to identify bad machines or identify deteriorating conditions. The question becomes how to quantify the results of these inspections. Technologies like vibration, thermography, ultrasound, oil analysis and motor circuit testing may be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After identifying machines in need of further analysis using detection, the next step is to determine the root cause of the problem. This is achieved during the analysis phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 1. Problem Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The purpose of performing an analysis is to determine the root cause of the problem. The analysis phase involves studying the machine&amp;rsquo;s operation, defect characteristics, maintenance history, etc. Only the machines indicating problems should be analyzed. Once the analysis is complete and the root cause of the problem found, the results should be communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2. Problem Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction/Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, it can be corrected. The most common problems require balancing and/or precision alignment. In order to maximize the reliability of the machine in question, it is also advisable to improve the source causing the asset to be in exception. This will extend the life of the machine. We at Universal Technologies emphasize that the incremental time required to improve the machine is small compared to the costs of the unanticipated machine downtime and the maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3. Problem Correction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After determining the root cause of the problem, correcting the problem and improving the machine, it is important to verify that the correction or improvement has occurred. One mechanism for this verification is comparing before values to the original baseline data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other common verification methods include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased bearing life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tracking increased seal life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring reduced energy consumption&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measuring vibration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thermography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor current signature analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4. Correction Verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the simplest, but often neglected, forms of condition monitoring is visual inspection of machinery. While this is subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;gut feel&amp;rdquo; for where the problem is most severe. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective visual inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for each of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General cleanliness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on surrounding machine&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on machine casing or bearing caps&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oil/fluids on coupling guard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unusual marks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visible leaks (lubricants, cooling water, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lighting conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Local instrumentation for proper levels, temperatures, flows and amperage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fretting and wear particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Signs of overheating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper operation of slinger rings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Condensation/water in bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Differential temperatures, pressures and flows&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loose parts or components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machine guard or cover condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audible inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another simple form of condition monitoring is audible inspection of machinery. While this is also subjective, you can often gain a good &amp;ldquo;feel&amp;rdquo; for the area where the source is originating. But remember, the root cause cannot be determined in this manner. The use of stethoscopes, sounding rods and other listening devices can enable an experienced practitioner to detect such problems as rubs, bearing defects, cavitation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When listening to a machine, try to determine if the sound is complex or simple, high frequency or low frequency, and from where the sound appears to be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effective audible inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sounds that are out of the ordinary&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Humming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Squealing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Growling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rubbing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cavitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Arcing/popping sounds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hunting/beats&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Noise from leaks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Comparison noise from bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water hammer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lifting sentinels/relief valves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flow through system / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactile inspection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To hand-feel a machine for excessive vibration, perform the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Start at the bearings, feeling in vertical, horizontal and axial directions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work downward and outward from the machine, feeling the base, structures, pipes, pipe supports, valve stems, electrical boxes, electrical conduit, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Try to get a sense of the frequency of the vibration. For instance, is it high frequency, such as a buzz or a tingle? Or, is it low frequency, such as a shudder or a sway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 10. Motor Check&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other tactile observations should be performed as well. Effective tactile inspection procedures include examination of the machine and surrounding area for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature comparisons on seal flush systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on cooler / heat exchanger inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Temperature differences on filters / strainers inlet and outlet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel oil for contaminants and metal particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Feel for flow through systems / components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhancing visual inspections with spot radiometers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Infrared thermometers measure the amount of infrared energy emitted by a target object and calculate the temperature of that object&amp;rsquo;s surface. Typical features include laser sighting, adjustable emissivity, alarm functions and trigger locks. Other features may include data loggers and graphic displays, thermocouples, and software interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that the temperature reading is the outer surface temperature of the first surface the laser beam penetrates. If taking a reading through Plexiglas or other transparent material that the laser penetrates, the temperature reading will represent the Plexiglas surface only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 11. Spot Radiometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; emissivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Emissivity is ability of a material to reflect heat. Different materials have different emissivity values and must be accounted for when attempting to obtain an absolute temperature reading. For comparison readings, emissivity is less of an issue provided that the two target materials are the same. If there is a need for accurate absolute temperature measurement, then the contact thermocouple provided should be used to cross-check the infrared data. Your instrument has functions that allow you to select the correct emissivity value for the target material, but for the intent of this article and general instrument use, the &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; setting will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Limitation &amp;ndash; measurement spot size: &lt;/strong&gt;The measured spot size depends on the distance between the object you are measuring and the infrared thermometer. This will vary depending on manufacturer and by models from the same manufacturer. Note that the temperature is an average of the temperatures contained within the spot circle. Move closer to the target to get a smaller measurement area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strobe lights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Visual inspection of rotating assets in conjunction with using a strobe light allows other components to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coupling, shaft and key condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leak detection from bearing caps, mechanical seals and couplings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mechanical looseness of machine components&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Belt condition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Even tensioning / loading of belt drive systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/lbisingerIMAGES.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12. Strobe Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Precautions and safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Objects viewed with this product may appear to be stationary when in fact they are moving at high speeds. Always keep a safe distance from and do not touch the target. Be aware of others in the area and take responsibility for their safety by warning them of these precautions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use of this equipment may induce an epileptic seizure with those prone to this type of attack.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do not allow liquids or metallic objects to enter the ventilation ports on the stroboscope to avoid damage to the instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Caution &amp;ndash; there are lethal voltages present inside the instrument. Refer to manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s literature for lamp replacement procedure before attempting to open the instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To assist in the inspection of couplings and belts with a strobe, it is recommended to use expanded metal with a flat black finish for coupling and belt guards whenever possible. This permits the user to see through the guard with a minimum of reflection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Performing visual, audible and tactile inspections can provide tremendous value when integrated into an overall reliability effort. Formalizing and documenting inspections that are being performed by non-PdM technicians will allow data to be utilized by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acceptance of integrating technologies to gain a better picture of equipment condition is widely accepted. Why not use this same model to leverage information from personnel who traditionally are not viewed as having an active role in reliability? Many times, operators and maintenance personnel can provide that &amp;ldquo;missing piece&amp;rdquo; of information that cannot be seen by the PdM technician when viewing equipment on a monthly or quarterly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many organizations would jump at the chance to add dozens of additional personnel to the reliability effort without adding additional cost? By training and engaging operators and maintenance personnel, that is exactly what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
