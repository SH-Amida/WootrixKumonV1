			<title>State laws boost flu vaccination rates in health care workers</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~3/IonZGik0qG8/160302121329.htm</link>
			<description>State laws mandating influenza immunization for people who work in health care increase their vaccination rates, according to new research. From 2000 to 2005, only Maine and New Hampshire had flu vaccine requirement laws for health care workers. During that period, the average flu vaccination rate for health care workers was 22.5 percent. From 2006 to 2011--when 19 other states, including Pennsylvania, passed similar laws--the average vaccination rate for health care workers increased to 50.9 percent.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/IonZGik0qG8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

The study aims to improve understanding of the key causes of employees going to work when sick, known as presenteeism, and to help make managers more aware of the existence of the growing phenomenon, what triggers the behavior and what can be done to improve employees' health and productivity.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/k-ER_J_c-HU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Across the country, many employees are seated at desks for the majority of an eight-hour workday. As technology creates an increase in sedentary lifestyles, the impact of sitting on vascular health is a rising concern. Now, researchers have found that when a person sits for six straight hours, vascular function is impaired -- but by walking for just 10 minutes after a prolonged period of sitting, vascular health can be restored.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/KoT5v5jd9uM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

Nearly twice the number of supervisors and managers reported they suffered from anxiety compared to workers. Symptoms of depression were reported by 18 percent of supervisors and managers compared to 12 percent for workers.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/NpKdFYxZ8xI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Over 1.5 million people currently work in the care sector in the UK and as the population ages, the demands for care and employees will increase. However, the health and social care sector has experienced challenges in recent years as a result of austerity measures in the public sector which has had implications for the pay and pensions of those working in the sector. With growing demands and fewer resources, the issue of workforce planning has become increasingly critical.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/zR_AwD9goN0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

They also experienced more sleep problems such as insomnia (23.6% vs. 16.3%), insufficient sleep (53.0% vs. 42.9%), or excessive wake-time sleepiness (31.8% vs. 24.4%).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/workplace_health/~4/mdlP6otDRGk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
