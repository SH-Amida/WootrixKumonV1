    <title>Americaâs Broadband Improves, Cementing a âPersistent Digital Divideâ</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546341/americas-broadband-improves-cementing-a-persistent-digital-divide/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;New figures show that U.S. broadband access is improving, but only for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. broadband infrastructure is improving fast, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/nation-makes-progress-broadband-deployment-challenges-remain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new figures&lt;/a&gt; from the Federal Communications Commission. But the gains are uneven, with people that live in rural areas left behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Spam Trail Leads to Chinaâs Three Largest Banks</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546311/spam-trail-leads-to-chinas-three-largest-banks/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A researcher made 300 purchases of fake luxury goods online and found that 97 percent were handled by Chinaâs largest three banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An academicâs investigation into the underpinnings of the fake luxury goods spam that pollutes in-boxes, social networks, and search results sheds new light on the economics of online crimeâand implicates some of the largest banks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Is Facebook About to Kill Off Twitter?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546286/is-facebook-about-to-kill-off-twitter/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is struggling to grow, its executives are leaving in droves, and now Facebook looks to be muscling in on its turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitterâs stock price has been tumbling for months, and CEO Jack Dorsey announced this week that several of its highest ranking executives &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-managementchanges-idUSKCN0V20ZF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;are fleeing&lt;/a&gt;. The deepest concern, though, isnât about corporate machinationsâit seems that the product itself simply isnât as compelling as Facebook. Walt Mossberg, one of the better-known tech pundits anywhere, said Twitter had become way too complicated to use and called it â&lt;a href=&quot;http://recode.net/2016/01/27/mossberg-twitter-has-become-secret-handshake-software/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret-handshake software&lt;/a&gt;â that only people who invest huge amounts of time can get full benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Will Machines Eliminate Us?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/qa/546301/will-machines-eliminate-us/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;People who worry that weâre on course to invent dangerously intelligent machines are misunderstanding the state of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoshua Bengio leads one of the worldâs preÃ«minent research groups developing a powerful AI technique known as deep learning. The startling capabilities that deep learning has given computers in recent years, from human-level voice recognition and image classification to basic conversational skills, have prompted warnings about the progress AI is making toward matching, or perhaps surpassing, human intelligence. Prominent figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have even cautioned that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity. Musk and others are investing millions of dollars in researching the potential dangers of AI, as well as possible solutions. But the direst statements sound overblown to many of the people who are actually developing the technology. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, put things in perspective in an interview with &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;âs senior editor for AI and robotics, Will Knight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The leader of the National Security Agencyâs hackers says that putting industrial control systems online has made America less secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend to connect devices such as air conditioners and door locks to the Internet is making life easier for the National Security Agencyâs hackersâbut also keeping their boss awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Carmakers are already struggling to make regular cars secure against hacksâself-driving technology will bring new problems, says a leading researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/423292/taking-control-of-cars-from-afar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demonstrated hair-raising hacks&lt;/a&gt; that make it possible to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/540441/carmakers-accelerate-security-efforts-after-hacking-stunts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;take over the brakes&lt;/a&gt;, engine, or other components of a personâs car remotelyâforcing the auto industry to take security more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Is 3-D Printing the Key to Cheap Carbon-Fiber Parts?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546046/is-3-d-printing-the-key-to-cheap-carbon-fiber-parts/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Two startups aim to make carbon-fiber parts more affordable by reinventing how they are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someday, carbon fiber might live up to its hype and make all of our cars and airplanes more lightweight and efficient. Today, though, parts made of the material are very expensive, and are used mainly in race cars, high-end sports cars, and new jetliners. Some entrepreneurs are now betting that the key to making carbon-fiber parts much cheaper and more widely used is 3-D printing technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Next Big Test for AI: Making Sense of the World</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545906/next-big-test-for-ai-making-sense-of-the-world/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A new database will gauge progress in artificial intelligence, as computers try to grasp whatâs going on in scenes shown in photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a breakthrough in machine learning suddenly enabled computers to recognize objects shown in photographs with unprecedentedâalmost spookyâaccuracy. The question now is whether machines can make another leap, by learning to make sense of whatâs actually going on in such images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Trials of Barack Obama, Gadget Hound</title>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal tech and presidential security donât play well together. So the most powerful man in the world almost certainly carries around a bunch of lame gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama loves his gadgets. Heâs the first POTUS to carry a smartphone, heâs into his iPad, and heâs been spotted with a Fitbit on his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Can We Insure the Internet of Things Against Cyber Risk?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545736/can-we-insure-the-internet-of-things-against-cyber-risk/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Software with security flaws, and a lack of historical data on risks, have made the Internet of things tough to insure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insuring the security of connected products is hard for a simple reason: they are too new, and too little is known about the economic losses or personal injury they might cause. What the industry needs is data, and analytics to translate statistics on losses into policy standards and consistent pricing. Only then can emerging industries like self-driving cars and network-connected medical devices really take off, says software security expert Josh Corman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
