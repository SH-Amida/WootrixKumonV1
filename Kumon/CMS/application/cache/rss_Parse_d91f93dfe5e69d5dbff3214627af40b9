Components that represent a core competence are reliably produced in-house on state-of-the-artÂ machine systems. This guarantees that electric motors, gearboxes, brakes and electronics are perfectly coordinated.</p>
<p>Vertical integration of ABM Drives&#8217; manufacturing includes tool-and-die engineering and aluminum die-casting to guarantee bestÂ implementation and integration of components to a compact drive unit. High-quality gearing guarantees quiet operation. Tight-fittingÂ housing covers and flanges prevent distortions that can amplify noise. Aluminum housings absorb harmonics and other vibrations betterÂ than cast iron.</p>
<p><strong>A large center distance between the motor centerline and the hollow drive shaft centerline gives the application designer moreÂ freedom/clearance to integrate the unit into the application.</strong></p>
<p>Many layouts are possible, from integration of the motor into the gearboxÂ housing, U mounting of the motor, to customizing the output shaft. The end result is a true plug-and-play motor and drive-unit solutionÂ designed to save time and money.

Designed as an easy-to-use solution for small machine shops, Mini-Skimmer R.S. skims unwanted tramp oils from coolants, but can rest easily with the flip of a switch once its job is complete.</p>
<p>Named after Rich Segermark, theÂ companyâs founder and inspirational innovator, Mini-Skimmer R.S. is the smallest of Wayne Productsâ expanding family of oil skimming products.</p>
<p>It is the only oil skimmer on the market with an on/off switch, allowing users to easily monitor its activity, and is lightweight and small for seamless transportation between machines.</p>
<p>The design of Mini-Skimmer R.S. emphasizes ease of use, knowing that smaller machine shops sometimes need a small, simple product that is portable, yet effective. Mini-Skimmer R.S. comes with the companyâs industry-standard, stretch-resistant, fiberglass-reinforced cogged belt but has a liquid tight housing made of anodized aluminum and a motor with the highest torque for a skimmer of its size. It is also shipped completely assembled â just plug it in and flip the switch.</p>
<blockquote><p>âThis oil skimmer is the perfect solution for small machining operations. It has been designed from scratch to address key customer needs while hitting a price point previously unattainable,&#8221; said Don Ware, President of Wayne Products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wayne Products offers industrial customer base an affordable product. Expect the company to continue to develop new products in the future as it fulfills its mission of providing the best and longest-lasting products to its customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The old way of connecting components in a motion control system was to make individual wire connections between components, which was time consuming and tedious. So when networks for motion control came along it was a relief, simplifying design and saving time and money.</p>
<p>Here are four of the biggest benefits of using networks in motion control systems:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Â  Â  Â Perhaps the biggest and most obvious benefit is that using network cables is far easier than connecting together individual wires into complex systems. Plus, modular designs make it easy to switch out standardized cables and connectors for repair or troubleshooting. Networked systems are also much easier to set up and troubleshoot.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Â Â Â Â Motion control networks also offer a number of functional benefits which really come across in high-speed motion applications, things such as better synchronization, faster data transfer rates, as well as better accuracy and precision. Especially for multi-axis motion control where tight synchronization is critical, networks such as EtherCAT, EtherNet/IP, and Sercos are designed to be deterministic, minimizing jitter.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Â  Â  Â Especially for Ethernet-based systems, there is the benefit of being able to easily connect with other enterprise-wide IT systems, which helps share data across the factory floor and throughout the enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>Â Â Â Â Â  Networks, especially those based on open protocols, create more choices for end users. Third-party vendors can easily develop compatible hardware or software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THERE ARE AS MANY ENCODER CHOICES as there are design objectives. When encoders provide position feedback, itâs common to specify encoder resolution exceeding what the application requires as a way to address the partial count uncertainty of digital measurements. Heavy industrial equipment for metal stamping, wind turbines, printing, and steel processing often uses high-speed rotary encoders that can reliably track speed and position even to 40,000 rpm. Other applications benefit from reflective encoders with interpolation for high-resolution measurement on small motors (usually closed-loop steppers) that drive axes on consumer products such as printers.</p>
<div id="attachment_15128" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-15128 size-full" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-P-356-Encoder-with-Profinet-Interface_Large.png" alt="encoders " width="450" height="373" srcset="http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-P-356-Encoder-with-Profinet-Interface_Large.png 450w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-P-356-Encoder-with-Profinet-Interface_Large-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Encoders with Profinet interface from Posital Fraba play a key role in an upgraded automotive production line.</p></div>
<p>Other machines need rugged and rated encoders with oversized bearings, specialty seals, and reinforced housings. Industrial-rated encoders work in interior elevators, automated process machinery, and robot joints. In contrast, applications that expose encoders to liquid submersion, washdown, contaminants, shock and vibration, or EMI noise necessitate more rugged versions. These applications include those for off-road equipment, cranes, wind turbines, food-and-beverage machinery, and medical devices. Usually, itâs either the failure of the encoderâs bearing (in the case of rotary setups) or contamination and signal failure that takes the encoder out of commission. For example, wood processing tends to be dusty, while food applications and their cleaning cycles tend to be steamy and force humidity inside encoder housings.</p>
<p>In applications where the design must track position along a linear axis, linear encoders excel. Machine tools make copious use of linear encoders, especially for the manufacture of aerospace parts needing milling and finishing.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing production lines up to speed</strong><br />
One industry that undergoes frequent changes is the automotive industry, as carmakers must respond to evolving customer preferences and regulatory requirements. That means regular upgrades to their production facilities as well.</p>
<p>One U.S. automaker recently decided to retool a Michigan engine plant for a new production program and update an automation system controlling equipment on the shop floor. The automaker hired Canadian integrator DataRealm Inc. to design and implement a new solution. The project included new IT interfaces, new PLCs, updated human-machine interfaces (HMI), new data communications and upgrades to sensors and actuators. The integrator was also responsible for programming and traceability.</p>
<div id="attachment_15129" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-15129 size-full" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-Station-Production-Workstation_Large.png" alt="encoders " width="450" height="563" srcset="http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-Station-Production-Workstation_Large.png 450w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FRABA-POSITAL-Station-Production-Workstation_Large-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A workstation on an automotive production line shows the updated equipment including PLCs and HMIs which helped increase production.</p></div>
<p>The plant was once state-of-the-art with PLCs close to machinery they controlled and some units protected with IP67-rated housings. Communication between controllers and sensors and actuators was through a proprietary networking system. The integrators decided more powerful PLCs and new networking were needed.</p>
<p>The plant upgrade first saw IP67-rated PLCs from Phoenix Contact and an INTERBUS fieldbus network. Current upgrades include the installation of a PROFINET data communications network. PROFINET, a form of industrial Ethernet, will enhance system support of an unlimited smart devices (sensors and actuators) and communication with higher-level manufacturing management systems.</p>
<p>New encoders for the system had to deliver accuracy, reliability, and compatibility with the upgraded communications networks, plus compactness and IP67 ratings or better for installation on existing machinery. POSITAL IXARC absolute rotary encoders met the requirements.</p>
<p>âPOSITAL had products that met our specs and supplied adaptor plates that simplified swapping out the old sensors,â said Dave Fortin, President of DataRealm. The availability of POSITAL encoders with both INTERBUS and PROFINET communication interfaces was another advantage.</p>
<p>The plant is successfully up and running with the new production program and the supporting automation system. In fact, it has emerged as the most productive plant of its type in the company.</p>
<p><strong>Encoders help align telescopes doing dark energy research</strong><br />
Another application relies on encoders for rotary and linear position feedback to precisely position a telescopeâs optical system. HEIDENHAIN encoders work in the Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET) to help researchers study dark energy. In place at the University of Texas-Austin at the McDonald Observatory, this telescope will fill in the gap of reaching longer distances in the sky than currently possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_15130" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-15130" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DYK-EL_PIC_-_Heidenhain_Encoders_on_New_Tracker_REV1_Large.png" alt="encoders " width="740" height="469" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Two encoders from HEIDENHAIN are used in the Hobby Eberly Telescope. The LB 382 linear scale is a reliable incremental-type steel tape scale with a grating period of 40 micrometers and accuracy of 5 micrometers. The EQN 437 is a multi-turn rotary encoder with integral bearings that boasts accuracy of +/- 20 arc-min.</p></div>
<p>Dark energy is currently understood to be a mysterious force pushing the universe apart. Called cosmic acceleration, the gravitational dark energy force is pushing instead of pulling. The HET (operational since the 1990s) began upgrades in 2013 and should soon offer more insight into dark energy. Nearly-completed equipment at the top of the HET consists of a new optical system and spectrographs. Three HEIDENHAIN linear scales are part of the new optical systemâs tracker, and six of the companyâs rotary encoders are affixed to an adjoining six-leg hexapod on top of the HET.</p>

<p>âHEIDENHAIN encoders give accurate position measurement on the HET,â said Herman Kriel, HET Project Manager. âThis telescope is different from conventional ones, as it does not move. Instead a tracker atop the telescope moves and aligns with a mirror, so must be extremely accurate.â</p>
<p>The new optical system has six axes of freedom and moves some of the optics up and down to focus the telescope and in tip and tilt to keep it aligned with the primary mirror. The rotation stage on top of the hexapod compensates for image rotation during tracks. Using HEIDENHAINâs three LB 382 linear scales on the X and Y stages and eight EQN 437 rotary encoders on the hexapod and rotation stage, the HET tracker will move Â±1.8 m in X and Y directions relative to the mirror, for a total travel of 3.6 m, and Â±9.5 Ë in tip and tilt and Â±21.5 Ë in rotation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomson Industries has released an educational video for design engineers illustrating how to properly install its SB Series power-off brake. Thomsonâs SB Series is designed as a servo brake with low backlash splines for high-performance applications such as robotics, medical equipment and packaging.</p>
<p>SB power-off brakes are typically mounted on the back end of a motor that requires the stopping and/or holding of a load in the absence of power. The video describes the installation of these brakes in simple and clear steps.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4zmldmYGTw" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Thomsonâs SB Series includes a spline drive, which is constructed to withstand high-impact stresses and minimize system backlash. The spring-set, electromagnetic power-off brakes provide a safe and efficient way of stopping or holding load in the absence of power. Low-inertia, rotating components enable higher acceleration rates for design engineers to consider using for their specified application.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Sinamics G120C, Siemens Drive Technologies expands its product portfolio of inverters. This compact device has been designed for various applications in industrial environments. It is suitable for use with pumps, compressors and fans, as well as mixers, extruders, conveyor belts and materials handling machines. The target groups for this new line are production machine builders (OEMs) and distributors seeking to buy ready-to-install inverter units.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Sinamics G120C, with a rated power range of 0.55 to 18.5 kW, sets new standards in its class with compact dimensions, fast commissioning times, simplicity of operation, ease of servicing and highly integrated functionality. The Sinamics G120C has been specially optimized for use in todayâs smaller control cabinets, mounted directly onto or positioned near production machines. These applications often require simple speed-controlled drives with a high power density in a smaller package.</p>
<blockquote><p>This compact inverter offers one of the highest power densities in its class and can be mounted directly as a machine module, without sacrificing power. Compared to conventional systems on the market, the G120C requires up to 30 percent less space, with up to 40 percent higher power density. Quick-connecting plug-in terminals allow faster installation.</p></blockquote>
<p>A port for inserting a memory card enables significantly faster inverter commissioning, as well. Instead of a blind cover, the operator panel may also be mounted for easier commissioning. It can also be parameterized using a PC, via USB interface. Standard protective coatings on the enclosure make the unit extremely robust in hostile or corrosive environments. This new Siemens inverter is designed for ambient temperatures of up to 60Â°C (140ÂºF).</p>

The compact device is suitable for operation in pumps, compressors, fans as well as mixers and extruders, but also for conveyor belts and simple handling machines.</p></div>
<p><strong>Each G120C inverter features the integrated Siemens safety technology branded &#8220;Safety Integrated&#8221; as standard, to ensure the drives can be stopped safely.</strong> The unit is equipped with a double safe input ex-works to control the STO (Safe Torque Off) function without the need for external devices. The G120C also offers users the established control procedures of the Siemens Sinamics platform, including sensorless vector operation, which enables precise, cost-effective control and more energy-efficient operation of induction motors.</p>
<p>For network communications, this new inverter supports the Profibus bus system from Siemens. It can also be directly integrated into other widely-used communications structures via USS field bus protocol, RTU mode and CAN bus. The ex-works default setting on each G120C enables direct application without time-consuming parameterization work on the field bus system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Safety is a serious concern for machine builders, system integrators, and end users. Not only do they have a responsibility to provide a safe production environment, they must also meet regulatory requirements for machine safety. And of course, all of this should occur with minimal impact on operational efficiency and productivity. Fortunately, functional safety features in machines and systems allow both scenarios to be realizedâmitigating the risk of injury without needlessly affecting production.</p>
<p>Designers of industrial machinery and equipment have to account for the fact that automated motion poses a significant risk of injury or damage. The aim of functional safety is to ensure that equipment operates correctly in response to its inputs. It requires a system to detect potentially dangerous conditions and to activate a protective or corrective device or command that willÂ prevent, or reduce the consequences of, a hazardous event.Â To this end, drives play aÂ central part in safety solutions.</p>

<p>Although the EU was the first market to mandate integrated safety functions in machinery, manufacturers around the world have begun to integrate functional safety features in machines marketed and sold outside of the EU. There are two primary standards that govern machine safety for industrial equipmentâEN/IEC 62061 and EN/ISO 13849-1. Most equipment that includes integrated safety follows one of these two standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>According to the <a href="http://www.iec.ch" target="_blank">IEC</a> (International Electrotechnical Commission) website:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>IEC 62061 specifies requirements and makes recommendations for the design, integration and validation of safety-related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems (SRECS) for machines. It is applicable to control systems used, either singly or in combination, to carry out safety-related control functions on machines that are not portable by hand while working, including a group of machines working together in a coordinated manner.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>According to the <a href="http://www.iso.org" target="_blank">ISO</a> (International Standards Organization) website:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>EN/ISO 13849-1:2005 provides safety requirements and guidance on the principles for the design and integration of safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS), including the design of software. For these parts of SRP/CS, it specifies characteristics that include the performance level required for carrying out safety functions. It applies to SRP/CS for high demand and continuous mode, regardless of the type of technology and energy used (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical, etc.), for all kinds of machinery.</em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do some standards begin with the prefix &#8220;EN?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The &#8220;EN&#8221; prefix designates a harmonized standard, which means it is listed under the EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. The Machinery Directive specifies essential safety and health requirements that all machines in the EU must meet. Harmonized standards include standards from ISO, IEC, and the European Union. These standard provide the technical specifications and procedures to fulfill the Machinery Directive requirements.</p>

<h4>Comparison of EN/IEC 62061 with EN/ISO 13849-1</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">EN/IEC 62061</span></p>
<ul>
<li>uses the SIL (Safety Integrity Level) rating system to indicate the level of functional safety</li>
<li>assigns a numeric scoreÂ from 1 to 4, with 1 being the lowest and 4 being the highest; example: SIL3 <em>(note that only levels 1-3 apply to machine systems)</em></li>
<li>risk assessment for determining the required SIL level is based on severity of injury (Se), frequency and duration of exposure (Fr), probability of occurrence of a hazardous event (Pr), and probability of avoiding or limiting harm (Av)</li>
<li>SIL rating indicates the Probability of Dangerous Failure per HourÂ (PFH<sub>D</sub>) and the Risk Reduction Factor (RRF)</li>

<hr />
<p>When implementing functional safety, machine builders, integrators, and users are free to choose either standardâEN/IEC 62061 or EN/ISO 13849-1. But whichever standard is used, it must be used in its entirety, and the two standards cannot be mixed. <strong>And itâs important to rememberÂ that functional safety is applicable to the machine and its control system, not to a specific component or type of device</strong>. <strong>For example, a servo drive may include features and functionality thatÂ <em>enable</em> a system to achieve a specific EN/IEC 62061 or EN/ISO 13849-1 safety category, but the use of the drive itself does not confer that safety level to the machine.</strong></p>
<p>Many drive manufacturers have published brochures or white papers addressing functional safety, and for good reason. While the concept of functional safety is relatively simple, the decision regarding what safety level should be applied to a particular machine or process is based on a complex mixÂ of quantitative factors and qualitative assessments. Some manufacturers have even developed proprietary software to assist designers in determining what functional safety level is required and in choosing the appropriate components to achieve that safety level.</p>

<p>Some simple checks diagnose a VFD in moments. <strong>Hereâs how to make the necessary inspections with a multimeter.</strong></p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.yaskawa.com/pycprd/training/meet-the-trainers" target="_blank">Daniel Schubert </a>â¢Â <a href="https://www.yaskawa.com/pycprd/products/product-directory" target="_blank">Yaskawa</a> Product Training Engineer</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Variable frequency drives (VFDs) are a staple component of many industrial and commercial applications in which motors run to complete tasks.</strong> VFDs can control and protect motors and in some applications, even offer energy savings. But as with any system component, VFDs can fail. Here we explain some troubleshooting techniques that engineers and plant personnel can use to check VFDs. The checklist for the major no-power checks we present here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety â with the system at less than 10 Vdc</li>
<li>An input check â as a diode check</li>
<li>A dc bus check â as a visual check</li>
<li>An output check â as a diode check</li>
<li>A review of checks</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Upfront warning: Safety when working with VFDs</strong></h4>
<p>Our number one concern is you the reader, so if you donât feel as though you possess the experience to perform these tests, contact a professional to perform them for you. Life-threatening voltage and current are present in the VFD even after the incoming supply is removed. Before testing, follow the lockout/tagout procedures for the system at hand. After this is completed, follow arc-flash procedures for the given system and follow local codes.</p>
<p>Locate the +(positive) and â(negative) dc bus terminals on the drive. Refer to the manual for the unit or contact the manufacture of the VFD if youâre unsure of the location of these terminals.</p>
<p>The multimeter should have at least a 1,000-V CAT III rating and the ability to make diode checks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15102 size-full" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-Yaskawa-diode-01-e1484750196393.jpg" width="100" height="58" title="" alt="" /></p>
<p>Set the multimeter to Vdc. Connect the +(Red) and -(Black) leads from the meter to the dc bus terminals on the VFD. If the value is above 10 Vdc but reducing, wait until the excess dc bus voltage is below 10 Vdc. This time varies depending on the drive capacity. If voltage doesnât fall below 10 Vdc, ensure input power to the drive is removed or contact the VFD manufacturer or installer.</p>
<h4><strong>VFD input check (at the rectifier)</strong></h4>
<p>In todayâs VFDs, the input or rectifier section is comprised of input diodes that convert an incoming three-phase ac sine wave into a rectified dc supply. There are at least two diodes for each phase. They are positioned in opposite conducting orientation to allow full-wave rectification. To check the input section, we need to perform simple diode checks. These checks include testing the forward and reverse bias direction of both diodes in each phase. This process uses the input terminals R/L1, S/L2, T/L3 on the drive and the dc bus terminals.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about where the input terminals are, refer to the VFDâs manual.</p>
<p>With a multimeter set to diode check &#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15102 size-full" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/06-Yaskawa-diode-01-e1484750196393.jpg" width="100" height="58" title="" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230; put the +(Red) lead on the input terminal (R/L1) and the â(Black) lead on the (+) DC bus terminal. This isolates the positive R/L1 phased diode. A good diode should read around 0.5 Vdc in the forward-bias direction. Repeat this process for the S/L2 and T/L3 terminals while leaving the â(Black) lead on the (+) dc bus terminal.</p>
<div id="attachment_15106" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-15106" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/02-NEW-Yaskawa-Troubleshooting-VFDs-101.gif" width="670" height="384" title="" alt="" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The first section of a VFD is the input rectifier section, which includes input diodes that chop three-phase ac waves into a positive and negative dc supply.</p></div>
<p>Note: <strong>When making this measurement, look for consistency across the all three input terminals.</strong> The measurement of 0.5 Vdc is only an approximation and can change depending on the VFD and model size. If at any time the meter reads 0 V, then that diode is shorted.</p>
<p>The next step is to check the reverse bias direction of the diodes. Move the â(Black) multimeter lead to the R/L1 terminal, and move the +(Red) multimeter lead to the (+) dc bus terminal. Then check the remaining two inputs by moving the â(Black) multimeter lead to the S/L2 and T/L3 terminals. The multimeter should eventually display (OL) after charging the driveâs filter capacitors. OL occurs when the power supply in the meter is unable to force current through the diode in the set direction.</p>
<p>We are now done with the upper diodes and need to check both directions of the remaining diodes on the rectifier. We start by placing the +(Red) multimeter lead on the (-) bus terminal and the â(Black) multimeter lead on the R/L1 terminal. This again should read around 0.5 Vdc. From there, move the â(Black) multimeter lead to the remaining S/L2 and T/L3 terminals while looking for consistency between the three measurements. Some engineers consider a variance of more than 0.05 Vdc between them to be a bad sign, as this could mean that one or more diodes need replacement.</p>
<p>Finally, move the -(Black) multimeter lead to the (-) dc bus terminal and the +(Red) lead to the R/L1 input terminal, then check the S/L2 and T/L3 input terminals, again making sure that the meter reads OL after a short time charging the filter capacitors. When charging the filter capacitors, the time can vary and increases with drive size.</p>
<p>We have now checked all the diodes in both bias directions. If at any time the meter reads 0 V, then that diode is shorted.</p>
<h4><strong>DC bus check on VFDs</strong></h4>
<p>After the diodes rectify the incoming ac wave into dc, the dc bus or dc capacitors store the voltage and have a smoothing effect on the dc bus voltage ripple. To fully check the capacitors, an engineer or plant worker would need to pull the individual capacitors out of the system and use a tester supporting high-microfarad capacitors.</p>
<div id="attachment_15107" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-15107" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03-NEW-Yaskawa-Troubleshooting-VFDs-101.gif" width="670" height="384" title="" alt="" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The first section of a VFD is the input rectifier section, which includes input diodes that chop three-phase ac waves into a positive and negative dc supply.</p></div>
<p>In lieu of this (for no-power checks) visual inspection for any signs of physical damage or electrolytic fluid leaking from the capacitor is sufficient. Sometimes itâs even possible to smell if the capacitor isnât good anymore &#8230; and the smell will most likely be a strong scent. If the unit in question has a lot of hours on it and maintenance personnel are already replacing other components, itâs not a bad idea to go ahead and replace the dc bus capacitors.</p>
<h4><strong>VFD output check (at the inverter)</strong></h4>
<p>The third and final section is the output or inverter section. This usually consists of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). The IGBTs take stored dc from the bus capacitors and work together to form a simulated ac output wave to the motor. The VFD uses pulse-width modulation (PWM) to control the voltage and frequency applied to the motor. The IGBT includes an emitter, collector, gate and free-wheeling diode. The VFD modulates the pulses applied to the motor by varying how long it applies a voltage between the gate-emitter junctions of the IGBT. This is called gating and it happens thousands of times per second.</p>
<div id="attachment_15108" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-15108" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/04-NEW-Yaskawa-Troubleshooting-VFDs-101.gif" width="670" height="384" title="" alt="" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The final VFD section is the output or converter. The free-wheeling diodes here get checked just as those at the drive input do.</p></div>
<p>The gating signals themselves canât be checked without power and are usually checked once power is applied, and the drive is running with no load â in other words, with no motor. That check involves using an oscilloscope to ensure the IGBTs are gating properly.</p>
<p>The free-wheeling diode completes the output circuit and handles any regeneration from the motor going back into the drive. This regenerated energy is then introduced back into the dc bus capacitors.</p>
<p>Our last check is basically another set of diode checks. Fortunately, in most cases the IGBT fails because the free-wheeling diode has shorted. How do we check this? We check it the same way we did the VFDâs input. More specifically, check the free-wheeling diodes just as the rectifierâs diodes were checked &#8230; but this time, use the U/T1, V/T2, and W/T3 terminals instead of the R/L1, S/L2, and T/L3 terminals. If the measurements show a good diode, youâre done. If the measurements show a short circuit (less than 0.5 Vdc in both directions) then you have a shorted IGBT.</p>
<h4><strong>Review of checks out-of-range values</strong></h4>
<p>Note that these checks cover the major components of the driveâs main circuit. If you have readings that arenât in this range, then itâs likely that you must remove the drive and either rebuild or replace it.</p>

<p>pace at some given time). The information can be about rotary position (as with rotary encoders) or linear position with linear encoders.</p>
<p>Encoders take rotary position and convert it to either an analog or digital signal. Encoders can also take information about position and calculate speed, so in this sense they are more versatile than a simple tachometer. However, modern tachometers arenât only confined to machine-mounted units. Aside from the traditional round, analog display type, a range of companies manufacture hand-held models that use lasers to measure speed of rotating equipment.</p>
<p>So if speed is the only variable of interest, then a simple tachometer will do the job and you wonât be paying more for extra functionality that you donât need.</p>

<p>The 84855104 BDE PRO controls motor speed and torque with extreme precision in a compact panel-mount package that measures just 5.1â x 3â x 1â.Â  Performance characteristics include a power range of 25A peak current and 15A continuous current while supporting both Hall-effect sensor and incremental encoder type feedback. Other features include a red/green LED that indicates operating status and three operation modes for current, encoder velocity or duty cycle.</p>
<blockquote><p>âThe BDE PRO is Crouzetâs highest functionality motor controller and is specifically âtunedâ to optimally drive DC brush motors at a high switching frequency,â says Robert Derringer, Channel Management and Product Marketing Director for Crouzet North America.Â  âAlthough intended as an optional counterpart for Crouzet DCmind brushed motors, the device is easily configured for use with DCmind brushless motors, and can also be used for many other motor types with simple changes in DIP switch and potentiometer settings.â</p></blockquote>
<p>When used with Crouzet DCmind motors, the cost effective system helps customers more precisely control the DCmind motor series, which is increasingly in demand for applications where silence, long life, efficiency and low EMC levels are required.</p>
<p>The unitâs powerful control capabilities meet a variety of application needs.Â  In the case of medical applications where a constant gentle velocity may be required, the BDE PRO can drive the motor at a gentle pace while being able to stop if needed. Its 4-quadrant operation allows the motor to go clockwise and counterclockwise quickly, and to stop immediately as needed, an important requirement in medical applications such as imagery, surgical equipment, mobile robotics, and precision pumps.</p>
<p>The new drive is fully protected against overvoltage, under-voltage, overcurrent, overheating and short circuits across motor, ground and power leads. It can interface with digital controllers or be used stand-alone, and requires only a single unregulated DC power supply. Loop gain, current limit, input gain and offset can be adjusted using 14-turn potentiometers. An offset adjusting potentiometer can also be used as an on-board input signal for testing purposes. The BDE PRO is certified under UL, cUL, CE and RoHS,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DC motors can be either brushed type, which are mechanically <a href="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/faq-what-is-the-commutator-in-a-dc-motor/" target="_blank">commutated</a>, or brushless, which are commutated electrically. In brushless DC (BLDC) motors, Hall effect sensors are used in place of a mechanical commutator and brushes.</p>
<p>Hall effect sensors are solid-state, magnetic field sensors. They workÂ on the principle that when a conductor with current flowing through it is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic field induces a transverse (or sideways) force on the charge carriers, which pushes them to the sides of the conductorânegative to one side and positive to the other side. This buildup of charge on the sides of the conductor induces a voltage. This effect is referred to as the Hall effect, after its discoverer, Edwin Hall.</p>

<p>The purpose of commutation, whether by mechanical or by electrical means, is to energize the stator windings in a certain sequence, with one winding positive, one negative, and the third one powered off. Torque production is caused by the attraction and repulsion between the stator field and the permanent magnets of the rotor.. Maximum torque is achieved when these two fields are oriented at 90 degrees to each other, and torque diminishes as they fields align. Therefore, in order to keep the motor turning, the statorâs magnetic field should change position as the rotor field âcatches upâ with it.</p>
<p>In order to energize the correct stator winding, the rotor position must be known. This is the job of the Hall effect sensorsâto monitor the rotorâs position. BLDC motors typically have three Hall effect sensors mounted either to the stator or to the rotor, and use what is known as six-step commutation. When the rotor passes a sensor, it produces either a high or a low signal to indicate which rotor pole (N or S) has passed. This switching of the three hall effect sensors (from high to low or from low to high) provides rotor position information every 60 degrees.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>60 degrees multiplied by six steps equals 360 degrees, or one full rotation. Hence, the term âsix-step commutation.â</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Hall effect sensors are the most common method of determiningÂ rotor position in BLDC motors, due to their low cost and ease of use with the permanent magnets of the rotor. And since the commutation happens in 60 degree increments, high-resolution sensing and output are unnecessary.</p>

<h4>Rotary servo tables use direct-drive technology</h4>
<p>Direct-drive rotary servo tables provide superior angular positioning andÂ eliminate backlash, friction and wear problems associated with worm, gear and belt drives. Low maintenance and high throughput characteristics of the DDR stages yields the lowest total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>These rotary tables useÂ <strong>direct-drive three phase brushless motor technology</strong>. There are no brushes to replace and no gear trains or belts to maintain.</p>
<h4>Rotary servo tables use absolute encoder</h4>
<p>Accurate positioning is assured with a precision encoder that provides arc-sec positioning resolution. The motor and rotary encoders are directly coupled to eliminate coupling backlash. The absolute encoder keeps track of its position always, and provides feedback as soon as power is applied. This feature is particularly useful in applications where the equipment has power turned off between uses. No need to move to home sensor or index pulse to establish a reference position. Ask the manufacturer for more information on the rotary servo tables through the portal atÂ <a href="http://www.intellidrives.com/index.php?route=product/request" target="_blank">intellidrives.com/product/request</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motorized size changeover of machine spindles or machine axes is now being implemented in various ways. The solutions to this are often relatively rudimentary. SoÂ no handwheel or crank is rotated, butÂ one or more buttons isÂ pressed instead. This isn&#8217;t an Industry 4.0 smart process chain.<strong>Â But intelligent <a href="https://www.siko-global.com/en-us/news/new-products/ag24" target="_blank">positioning drives</a> can be an efficient and more sophisticated alternative.</strong> More after the jump.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15068" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AG24-from-SIKO-Smarter-format-change-â-power-pack-in-the-industrial-Ethernet.jpg" width="670" height="558" srcset="http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AG24-from-SIKO-Smarter-format-change-â-power-pack-in-the-industrial-Ethernet.jpg 2000w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AG24-from-SIKO-Smarter-format-change-â-power-pack-in-the-industrial-Ethernet-300x250.jpg 300w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AG24-from-SIKO-Smarter-format-change-â-power-pack-in-the-industrial-Ethernet-768x640.jpg 768w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AG24-from-SIKO-Smarter-format-change-â-power-pack-in-the-industrial-Ethernet-1024x854.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="" alt="" />The more complex systems become, the more sophisticated the required data exchange is. What is the advantage of a highly efficient production process when the entire production is suddenly halted by unexpected maintenance?</p>
<p>Intelligent networks, such as Industrial Ethernet, also require a high degree of diagnostic capability for fault analysis, as well as an efficient and fast exchange of process data. <strong>For the smart size changeover, actuating drives are necessary.</strong> In addition to the purely motorized changeover, these drives permit a complex data exchange with your control systems, reliably detect operating states outside the fixed range, and communicate status or error messages, for example. So a constantly increasing load current could signal that the adjustment axis may be heavily contaminated by pollutants and must be cleaned during the next maintenance service.</p>
<p><strong>This is precisely where the intelligent actuators from SIKO start. In addition to the pure exchange of process data, these actuators also make all diagnostic values available to be able to prevent unplanned downtime from format setting.</strong></p>
<h4>The all-in-one drive from SIKO â AG24</h4>
<p>With the new AG24, SIKO has now expanded its portfolio of positioning drives with intelligent RTE (real-time Ethernet). In addition to the tried and tested SIKO positioning drives AG25 and AG26, which are characterized by their ultracompact design, the AG24 has now been released to expand the portfolio of actuators. Despite the considerable output power and speed of the AG24, all the components are still integrated into one housing. No external components or junction boxes are needed to connect to your higher-level controller. This means that the drive is connected only to the supply voltage and the port for data exchange must be connected directly to the controller or the next drive in the network. A simpler network connection is hard to imagine.</p>
<h4>Communication standards that lead in machine-toolÂ and general automation applications</h4>
<p>In industrial automation it is important that standards be met which make it easier for the system integrator to integrate the peripheral equipment into its control environment. The AG24 serves the leading standard communication interfaces Profinet, Ethernet IP, Powerlink and EtherCAT. Numerous function blocks, add-on instructions as well as different libraries are important software tools which offer the user a substantial simplification of system integration. Due to the extensive experience gained from the applications of the AG25 and AG26 drives, which have already become successfully established in the market, we therefore also offer a large selection of corresponding software tools for our new AG24.</p>
<h4>Power pack in all situations</h4>
<p>With a maximum rated torque of 14 Nm, the new AG24 is a real power pack. The compact drive reaches its maximum changeover speed of 150 rpm at a nominal torque of 6 Nm and can fully automate virtually any manual adjustment effortlessly. Due to the hollow shaft with clamping ring and torque support, the drive is very simply adapted to the existing machine shaft without the basic construction of the adjustment unit having to be changed. Other shaft diameters or the force transmission via a feather key groove is available as an option. The robust metal housing is designed with a protection class of up to IP65.</p>
<h4>Monitoring desired</h4>
<p>With the integrated 2-line LCD and the integrated keypad, not only can the individual IP addresses be assigned; the current actual value and the respective setpoint can also be directly monitored for diagnostics. Furthermore, via the display and the keyboard, it is possible to check each stored parameter and to adjust it if necessary. Possible operating data can be read out and errors can be diagnosed without an analysis via the fieldbus being necessary.</p>
<h4>Maintaining position</h4>
<p>With the integrated position controller, the setpoints are approached accurately with up to 1024 steps per revolution. With an optional integrated electromechanical brake, the position is also held securely in the case of external mechanical loads. Even without a brake, though, you never lose control of the positions. The integrated absolute value sensor also detects motions in the currentless state, which is why the real position of the drive can be read back at any time when the system is switched on again.</p>
<p>With the new AG24, SIKO serves applications in which difficult manual changeovers have previously only been possible to automate with great effort. Therefore the governing philosophy is that all modules which form an intelligent drive are integrated into one unit, so no external additional components need be installed and wired. The AG24 is a compact drive which deserves the name even apart from the impressive performance data.</p>
<h4>Test equipment â Free samples of the positioning drives</h4>
<p>Positioning drives, including function modules and software tools, are made available for test purposes free of charge by SIKO GmbH. This enables customers to test the equipment under no obligation and to convince themselves of the quality and problem-free integration of the positioning drives.

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-dahlquist-74705926" target="_blank">Craig Dahlquist</a> â¢Â Application Engineer atÂ <a href="http://www.lenze.com/en-us/home/" target="_blank">Lenze Americas</a>Â ||Â <strong>As with most applications, the requirements of the application can determine what type of drive architecture is selected.</strong></p>
<p>The single-axis control means that the DC power supply is internal to each drive.This is Lenze&#8217;s 9400 single-axis servo drive.The multi-axis control utilizes a central DC power supply that a number of axes share through the common DC power. There are also control schemes that can utilize a combination of both single and multi-axis control.</p>
<p>There are generalities with both the single and multi-axis control schemes. <strong>With the multi axis control the assumption is that there are more than three axes in the system that generally require less than 30 kW of total power.</strong> Because the power for each axis is shared between a common DC power supply, the cost advantage greatly increases when more and more drive axes share the common power supply. Generally, the multi-axis drive costs less than its single axis counterpart because the multi axis does not have AC to DC rectification section. Some manufacturers offer multiple axes control in one single multi axis drive unit. In this case, the cost per axis is again significantly reduced.</p>
<div id="attachment_15056" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-15056" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Lenze-i700-multi-axis-controls-e1484057525559.jpg" width="330" height="448" title="" alt="" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is Lenze&#8217;s i700 servo inverter for multi-axis applications.</p></div>
<p><strong>The single-axis design is generally used when there are only a few axes in the system or when the power requirements are larger than 15 kW for individual axes.</strong> When there are only a couple axes in the system with a total power of less than 30 kW, the additional cost of the power supply with the multi-axis drives is generally greater than the the single axis solution.This is Lenze&#8217;s i700 servo inverter for multi-axis applications.</p>
<p><strong>The multi-axis solutionÂ (when cost allows) offers other advantages. Generally, the multi-axis solution requires less control cabinet panel space.</strong></p>
<p>Because there is one main AC line feed for many axes, there is a great reduction in the number of over-current protection devices, line filters or line chokes.</p>
<p>Also, if dynamic brake resistors are necessary, the number resistors required can be reduced. Multi-axis systems have the advantage of sharing power within the closed system. It is possible for some axes in the system to regenerate power otherÂ axes in the system motor. While single axis systems can share the DC bus power in a similar fashion, the multi-axis generally can achieve this without additional wiring or fusing.</p>
<p>Overall, when designing a new control cabinet, look to utilize as many axes as possible into a multi-axis control scheme and then for the larger drives use single axis controllers. With this approach, it may be possible to use a smaller control cabinet because the number of devices has been reduced. With less devices being wired and mounted, labor costs can also be reduced. Every new application mustÂ be configured to minimize the total costs while assuring that all of the specification requirements are met.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-dahlquist-74705926" target="_blank">Craig Dahlquist</a> â¢Â Application Engineer atÂ <a href="http://www.lenze.com/en-us/home/" target="_blank">Lenze Americas</a>Â || <strong>With high construction costs of rare earth permanent magnet synchronous servo motors, asynchronous (induction) motors are more acceptable, when possible.Â </strong></p>
<p>With specially designed asynchronous servo motors, one way to get servo control to an asynchronous motor is another way to get more power density from a conventional 230/400 or 230/460 Vac (delta/wye connection) motor when 400 to 480 Vac is the supply voltage. Typically, the delta connection is used for 230 Vac (50/60 Hz) across the line. However with an inverter, a 50 Hz motor with a 400 VAC supply voltage can control 230 Vac at 50 Hz.</p>
<p>As long as the correct Volts/Hz curve is followed, the motor can maximize power at 87 Hz.</p>
<p>The torque will also stay constant to 87 Hz before the motor goes into field weakening. The math for this is simple: 400/230 Â· 50 Hz = 87 Hz. The calculations are the same for configuring 230/460 VAC, 60 Hz motors. Since the torque remains constant, the resulting power is equal to the motor power rating at 50 Hz Â· 1.732 (square root of 3). The rated current will also have a 1.732 factor compared to the 400 Vac rating in a Wye connection.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15048" src="http://www.motioncontroltips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors.jpg" width="670" height="362" srcset="http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors.jpg 2036w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors-300x162.jpg 300w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors-768x415.jpg 768w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors-1024x554.jpg 1024w, http://3l4sbp4ao2771ln0f54chhvm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/How-to-use-servo-drives-with-asynchronous-motors-740x400.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" title="" alt="" /></p>
<p>The result will be a motor capable of 73.2% more power from the same rotor inertia. A resolver is our most common feedback device. The resolver is robust (thanks to no wear parts) and is a single-turn absolute position device (for feedback onÂ rotor-position angle).</p>
<p>The servo axis generally has to be accelerated and decelerated very dynamically for the application. Sometimes this is only possible with aÂ permanent-magnet servo motor. <strong>When an asynchronous motor can meet the application specifications, generally the cost of the asynchronous motor is much less than the permanent magnet servo motor.</strong> Another reason for using the asynchronous servo or induction motor is to take advantage of the larger motor rotor inertia. When the application has a high inertia load, it may be necessary to get a lower inertia mismatch between the motor/geared motor and load. Also, in winding applications, the asynchronous motor offers a very deep field weakening range.</p>
<blockquote><p>Winding applications are the main reason Lenze offers motors that have rated motor frequencies well below 50 or 60 Hz. This allows for the motor to run into field weakening earlier to better match the speed-torque curve of the winding application with the motor.</p></blockquote>
<p>As in all designs, the application requirements determine the motor technology possibilities. <strong>In general, the next step is to determine the most cost effective solution for the application.</strong> Sometimes the asynchronous motor can be used in an application previously thought of as a permanent magnet servo motor application. Or, the asynchronous motor is the only choice for some applications.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lenze has produced asynchronous servo motors for more than 25 years. The motors are specially designed for rated operating frequencies that are well above or below 50 or 60 Hertz. The induction motors are also specially designed to increase the power density of the motor. The motor ranges from 80 watts (0.107 Hp)Â  to 60 kW (80 Hp). The operating frequencies range between 20 to 140 Hertz. Motors that are not in the 50/60 Hertz range need to be connected by a general purpose or servo inverter. Non-50/60 Hz motors cannot be connected directly across a 3-phase, 230 (0.080 to 0.6 Kw) or 400/480 VAC main supply voltage.</p>
