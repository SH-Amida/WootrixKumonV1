                OSHA proposes nearly $89,000 in penalties after determining New Jersey concrete manufacturer County Concrete Corp. failed to abate hazards found during a previous inspection.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osha.gov/ooc/citations/CountyConcreteCorp_1162893.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OSHA issued citations for one repeat and two failure-to-abate violations to County Concrete Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, after an inspection on July 19, 2016 determined that the company failed to abate hazards found in a 2013 inspection. At that time, OSHA cited the company for 18 safety and health violations, and assessed $153,900 in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>OSHA: Amtrak Must Reimburse Employee $892,551 for Retaliation </title>

    &lt;div class=&quot;field-deck&quot;&gt;

        
        
                
                A railroad employee who was terminated after raising safety concerns will receive a payout from Amtrak.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent OSHA whistleblower investigation discovered the National Railroad Passenger Corp., also known as Amtrak, reprimanded a supervisor in its inspector general&amp;#39;s office when he raised safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early to mid-2010, the worker, a supervisory special agent, was in the process of investigating an Amtrak contractor for fraud and was testing concrete at Amtrak tunnel projects. While at the worksite, the employee discovered unsafe conditions resulting from work performed by the contractor and raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>EHSFIT: Finding Your Passion </title>
    <link>http://ehstoday.com/blog/ehsfit-finding-your-passion</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;node-body blog-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying active in cooler temperatures and avoiding cabin fever can be quite the challenge. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s always a balance between the cold and precipitation this time of year. It&amp;rsquo;s not much different than assessing risk in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always ask a set of questions: What is the temperature? If it is between 30&amp;deg;F and 40&amp;deg;F, what are the conditions of the trails in the park? Is there ice? Are the roads and sidewalks clear? What clothing do I need to keep my skin and body protected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Utility workers die after losing consciousness in a drainage hole due to a buildup of hydrogen sulfide and methane. A rescue worker is in the hospital after removing his air pack to enter the confined space.

&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three underground utility workers in Florida died Monday after entering a confined space without the proper protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident, which occurred in Key Largo, Fla., began when the first man removed a manhole cover, entered a 15-foot-deep drainage hole and became unresponsive, according to news reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second worker entered with the intention of saving him but also lost consciousness. Likewise, a third man climbed into the hole was overcome by fumes. All three workers perished. None were wearing any respiratory protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                New rules target chemical manufacturing, establish a process for identifying high-risk chemicals and prioritize which chemicals should be evaluated.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 40 years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will have established rules to prioritize and evaluate chemicals in the marketplace and the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which was signed on June 22, 2016, gives the EPA the authority to look at and regulate unevaluated chemicals in the marketplace originally grandfathered in with the Toxic Substances Control Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Occupational physicians can and should use evidence-based care to improve outcomes for employees while reducing risk and costs for employers.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. healthcare system has undergone significant changes over the years. One transformation that likely will stand the test of time is the industry&amp;#39;s transition from fee-for-service to value-based care payment models, which helps reduce cost while improving quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Future of Lockout/Tagout: Is Zero Risk an Outdated Approach?</title>

                The ANSI/ASSE Z244.1 Standard is considered the defining document for addressing the complex issues of lockout/tagout and methods for the control of hazardous energy, and the Z244 Committee is moving in a new direction.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control of hazardous energy in the workplace continues to be a challenge for many employers. According to OSHA, failure to control hazardous energy accounts for nearly 10 percent of the serious accidents in many industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Even when you think you aren&#039;t contagious, you might still be. 
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had an eventful holiday season. I went to three different houses, visited my family and watched as many of them came down with the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue began with my niece two days before Christmas Eve. Usually bubbly and charismatic, she was confined to her bed. Sparing the details, my mother took care of her, cleaning up the mess and making sure she had plenty of fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Seven Million Ways to Prevent Injuries </title>
    <link>http://ehstoday.com/fall-protection/seven-million-ways-prevent-injuries</link>
    <description>

    &lt;div class=&quot;field-deck&quot;&gt;

        
        
                
                OSHA&#039;s new take on the Walking-Working Surfaces and Fall Protection standard is causing companies in general industry to re-evaluate safety plans for slip, trip and fall prevention.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades after OSHA first held a public meeting regarding revisions to its Walking-Working Surfaces standard for general industry, the final rule will become effective on Jan. 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revision to 29 CFR Part 1910 general industry addresses subpart D &amp;ndash; for slip, trip and fall hazards and subpart I &amp;ndash; adding requirements for personal fall protection systems. In addition, it eliminates the existing mandate to use guardrails as a primary fall protection method and allows employers to choose from accepted fall protection systems, according to OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;field-deck&quot;&gt;

        
        
                
                A survey commissioned by the American Academy of Ophthalmology found that the majority of U.S. adults have eye problems, but most don&#039;t seek help.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey found that nearly two out of three American adults report having eye or vision problems, but most of them fail to have regular eye exams that could predict or prevent serious problems. Add me to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I got Lasik surgery on my eyes. Having worn glasses (and later, contact lenses) since I was in second grade, the surgery was like a miracle. I wake up in the morning and I can see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t seem that long ago I could run a six-minute mile. I could still feel the pain in my chest &amp;ndash; like a gorilla is giving me CPR &amp;ndash; after a run. And the wanting to drink a gallon of water and die part. I remember that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was half a life ago, back in the Navy, when I was forced to run. Then I got out and ran less and less, blaming achy knees and an overall hatred of running. Sometime during my wife&amp;#39;s first pregnancy, I lost the will to work out all together, though my ability to kill a pint of Ben and Jerry&amp;#39;s went up exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>EHSFIT: Finding Time for Fitness</title>
    <link>http://ehstoday.com/blog/ehsfit-finding-time-fitness</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;node-body blog-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get up. Let the dogs out. Make coffee. Figure out breakfast. Shower. Commute. Work. Run. Home. Clean the house. Find time for friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time I wake up in the morning to the time I get to the office, two-and-a-half to three hours of the day already is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlines. Commute home. Dinner. &amp;nbsp;Friends? Cleaning. Sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding time for fitness can be hard. Juggling obligations and prioritizing things that need to get done can be difficult. So, where do I find 8 to 10 hours per week to run? The simple answer is I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>BBS: Silver Bullet or Out-Dated Thinking?</title>
    <link>http://ehstoday.com/safety-leadership/bbs-silver-bullet-or-out-dated-thinking</link>
    <description>

    &lt;div class=&quot;field-deck&quot;&gt;

        
        
                
                Is behavior-based safety a silver bullet, or one of several tools in your toolbox?
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavior-based safety (BBS) has its disciples and its critics. It has been called the silver bullet of safety and it also has been labeled as yesterday&amp;#39;s thinking. Based on the evidence, it is neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it really was a silver bullet, the organizations using it would be accident-free. If it truly was old and dead, it would have been abandoned by previous users and would not be attracting new ones. So, if BBS is neither magic nor dead, what is it? The answer to this question depends heavily on how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                New research from Liberty Mutual places a dollar amount on the cost of serious, nonfatal workplace injuries to American businesses.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/research-institute/communications/workplace-safety-index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, serious, nonfatal workplace injuries now amount to nearly $60 billion in direct U.S. workers&amp;rsquo; compensation costs per year. This translates into more than $1 billion dollars a week spent by businesses on these injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Final Beryllium Rule Lowers Exposure Limit for Workers</title>

                In a final rule issued the first week of  2017, OSHA has lowered the beryllium exposure limit and established new key provisions to protect workers in a broad range of industries.
                
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;rsquo;s final rule lowering the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for beryllium couldn&amp;rsquo;t come soon enough, according to safety industry advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 62,000 workers are exposed to beryllium during their work day, including 11,500 construction and shipyard workers, according to OSHA. Beryllium, either inhaled or through skin contact, contributes to an increased risk of lung cancer, chronic lung disease and various sudden on-set respiratory ailments among workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;node-body article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tax bill making its way through Congress is aiming to shape the way the American public utilizes health savings accounts to focus on prevention, not just treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Personal Health Investment Today (PHIT) Act, first introduced to the house in March 2015 and more recently to the Senate in November 2015, is a bi-partisan supported proposal that would allow medical account tax deductions to be applied to some specified costs associated with staying active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
