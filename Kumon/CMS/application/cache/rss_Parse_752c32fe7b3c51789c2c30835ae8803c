      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th&amp;nbsp;President of the United States last week and promptly updated the White House website with a new set of policy pages, including his &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The page makes no mention of renewable energy or climate action, marking a stark shift from President Obama. Trump&amp;rsquo;s plan also commits to embracing the oil and shale gas revolution, advancing independence from foreign oil and reviving America&amp;rsquo;s coal industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the website change, news broke last week of a Trump administration &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;budget blueprint&lt;/a&gt; that includes deep cuts to the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s clean energy programs. These developments seem to contrast with Trump&amp;#39;s position on promoting U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/america-is-losing-the-energy-innovation-race-trump-can-help-win-it"&gt;innovation and job growth&lt;/a&gt;. They also &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla"&gt;contradict statements&lt;/a&gt; from DOE Secretary nominee Rick Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what&amp;#39;s next for clean energy and climate action in America?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We sat down to discuss with Brandon Hurlbut, partner and co-founder of Boundary Stone Partners, an advisory firm on energy technology, public policy and finance, in Greentech Media&amp;#39;s first interview via Facebook Live. Hurlbut offers an insider perspective on Washington, D.C. and Democrat policies, having served as chief of staff for Secretary Steven Chu at the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also spoke with Shane Skelton, partner and co-founder of S2C Pacific, a policy consulting firm focused on energy and technology policy. Skelton previously served as energy policy adviser to the U.S. House of Representatives&amp;rsquo; Committee on the Budget, under then-Chairman Paul Ryan, who now serves as House Republican leader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Republican Political Donors Install Nearly as Much Solar as Democratic Donors</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/VdNqJ4uIzs8/republican-political-donors-install-nearly-as-much-solar-as-democratic-dono</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Even some of President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s fiercest critics admit that his election win was largely due to his ability to connect on a visceral level with voters who had long felt ignored and disrespected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it was his unscripted, often rambling speeches or his zest for politically incorrect barbs, Trump made many of his supporters believe that he genuinely understood their priorities and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But there is growing evidence that -- at least when it comes to clean energy -- there is a wide chasm between the policy positions the president supports and what many of his Republican supporters actually believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the campaign, Trump ignored clean energy and focused mostly on promoting coal, oil and gas. But as reputable political surveys have shown, Republican voters&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-survey-shows-renewable-energy-polls-ridiculously-well-among-trump-voter"&gt;actually want more support of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; over fossil fuels. And they are proving that with their wallets, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is one of the most intriguing findings in &lt;a href="https://powerscout.com/site/who-installs-more-solar-democrats-or-republicans-we-used-ai-to-look-at-1-5-million-houses-to-find-out/" target="_blank"&gt;a new study by PowerScout&lt;/a&gt;, an Oakland-based company that uses data to assist consumers who are considering going solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout examined about 1.5 million rooftops in the top 20 solar markets nationwide and found that Democratic and Republican party donors installed residential solar systems at roughly equal rates -- 3.06 percent of Democratic donors and 2.24 percent of Republicans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In California, by far the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest residential solar market, Republicans and Democrats install solar at about the same clip, while in Hawaii Republicans install more solar than Democrats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The timing of the study&amp;rsquo;s release to coincide with Trump&amp;rsquo;s inauguration was not an accident. &amp;ldquo;We want to put a stake in the ground and send a message to the incoming administration, to President Trump and to Secretary Perry, to show in a data-driven way that this is not a partisan issue,&amp;rdquo; said Attila Toth, the CEO and co-founder of PowerScout, who formerly ran SunEdison&amp;rsquo;s distributed generation business. &amp;ldquo;With this household-level data, you can show there is a real economic-driven, non-partisan demand for this type of clean energy asset.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout&amp;rsquo;s study is not the only research to expose the wide clean energy divide between some Republican politicians and the party&amp;rsquo;s most ardent supporters. Last September, the energy information company SolarPulse released a &lt;a href="https://www.solarpulse.com/blog/are-republicans-or-democrats-more-likely-to-invest-in-solar/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that examined data from 25,000 California homes that had installed solar between 1997 and 2015, finding that Republican-leaning communities were five times more likely to purchase rooftop solar than were communities that voted for Democrats. A 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-republicans-are-5-times-more-likely-to-buy-solar-than-democrats"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication also found that 84 percent of all registered voters, including 75 percent of Republicans, supported additional funding for clean energy sources like wind and solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Pocketbook voting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PowerScout&amp;rsquo;s study was different from past research in two significant ways. Rather than studying the voting patterns and partisanship of geographic areas with relatively large amounts of installed solar, the company zoomed in on the household level. In other words, it wanted to find out how willing individual Democrats and Republicans were to shell out money for a solar installation. In addition, the study examined the homes of 1.5 million rooftops -- a robust dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reach its findings, PowerScout pulled the Federal Election Commission&amp;rsquo;s lists of donors to the Democratic and Republican parties and candidates in the top 20 solar markets. Toth felt that focusing on donors was the best gauge available for an individual household&amp;rsquo;s party affiliation. &amp;ldquo;We have seen studies before that lump people together by the voting preference of a county where they reside. To us, that is not granular enough to explain someone&amp;rsquo;s political tendencies,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If someone forks out money, that shows their political leaning at the household level.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From those publicly available lists of donors, PowerScout then filtered out work addresses, post office boxes and apartments so it could focus on single-family homes where a residential solar system could be installed. After winnowing the initial donor lists down, PowerScout was left with 1.5 million homes, 1 million of which were Democratic donors and the rest of which were Republican supporters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning to identify solar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to get the household-level data it desired, PowerScout next gathered satellite images of all 1.5 million homes of Democratic and Republican donors. Naturally, it would be too time-consuming and cumbersome to have people search each rooftop for solar panels, so the company instead employed a machine-learning model called a convolutional neural network, or CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We went through and labeled images of houses that had solar and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Ulin, head of data science at PowerScout. &amp;ldquo;You feed those into the model, and the model, based on those examples, can learn to differentiate between homes with solar and without solar.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The model isn&amp;rsquo;t actually looking at all the images, at least as we would imagine it. Instead, it converts each image into numerical values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;So every pixel in the image has three values, a different number for every red, green and blue channel. You end up with a model that has millions of variables as opposed to simple regression models that only have a handful,&amp;rdquo; said Ulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, Ulin said he optimized the model through a technique known as gradient descent. &amp;ldquo;The model goes through hundreds of iterations to find the optimal settings for millions of variables. Every time it does, we score the output and how well the model identifies the labeled images,&amp;rdquo; he said, noting that the model was about 90 percent accurate at identifying images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toth said the technology can be used to identify the people who are most likely to purchase clean energy technologies like solar and substantially cut customer-acquisition costs. &amp;ldquo;You can build a propensity model that helps you to focus marketing dollars on high-propensity customers,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With more data and smarter marketing, Toth believes that, over time, customer acquisition costs can be sliced sixfold. &amp;ldquo;Today, solar customer acquisition costs are in excess of 15 percent to 17 percent of the total purchase price,&amp;rdquo; he said, comparing those costs with the 3 percent to 4 percent average in the car industry. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason you should pay $6,000 to acquire a solar system [customer] when the hardware is costing less than that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If those cost reductions come to fruition, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that solar will become even less of a partisan issue than it is now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Will a Trade War With China Help or Hurt the American Solar Industry? Itâs Complicated</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/62fE9TXAFws/will-a-u.s.-china-trade-war-help-or-hurt-the-u.s.-solar-industry</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/will-a-u.s.-china-trade-war-help-or-hurt-the-u.s.-solar-industry</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The election of Donald Trump raises a lot of questions for the U.S. solar industry. Trump hasn&amp;#39;t exactly been supportive of solar energy, but he hasn&amp;#39;t made it an explicit target of his ire either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	President Trump&amp;#39;s impact on the solar industry could come through trade policy, an area where the president has fairly wide latitude to make rules. If he labels China a currency manipulator, as he has promised, it would give him wide authority to draw up tariffs on Chinese imports, which he has &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/21/donald-trump-has-floated-big-tariffs-what-could-im/" target="_blank"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; may be as high as 45 percent -- although a 25 percent across-the-board tariff seems to be a more common proposal. Tariffs that high could have a mixed impact on the economy broadly, and could lead to a trade war between the world&amp;#39;s two biggest economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The booming U.S. solar industry -- heavily reliant on China and other countries in Asia for low-cost supplies -- is caught in the middle of this rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are already tariffs on Chinese solar products and materials. And the solar industry has already figured out how to deal with them. Given long-simmering tensions with China over solar, it&amp;#39;s likely that tariffs wouldn&amp;#39;t have a major impact on the solar industry. But it&amp;#39;s worth looking into, assuming Trump decides to provoke China further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to trade, there&amp;#39;s rarely a simple single-order cause and effect. Trade follows something more like the butterfly effect, with broad impacts on the solar industry that would be both positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tariff cheerleaders: U.S. solar manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solar manufacturers would certainly like to see additional tariffs on Chinese imports. SolarWorld led previous trade cases against Chinese solar companies, and it&amp;#39;s easy to see how U.S. manufacturers Mission Solar, SolarCity and Suniva could see a slight advantage if additional tariffs are placed on competitors&amp;#39; products. The U.S. solar manufacturing industry has been one of the most damaged by low-cost Chinese panels and, in theory, it would see the biggest benefit from tariffs on Chinese imports. But America&amp;#39;s manufacturers must still work hard to be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To put the impact of tariffs into perspective, GTM Research&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-pulse"&gt;PV Pulse Q4 2016&lt;/a&gt; estimates that blended module prices were $0.42 per watt last quarter. A 25 percent import tariff would add about $0.10 per watt to the cost of a solar panel, or $600 to the cost of a 6-kilowatt system, and a 45 percent tariff would add $0.19 per watt, $1,140 for a 6-kilowatt system. (That&amp;#39;s assuming tariffs are 100 percent effective.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Barry Cinnamon, who owns residential installer Cinnamon Solar, said customers would be willing to pay a few hundred dollars more to buy American-made modules. But he also said the upside for installers pushing domestically made panels is limited. With that in mind, he said he&amp;#39;s "not supportive of tariffs on solar modules since they jeopardize approximately 180,000 installation jobs at the expense of 20,000 manufacturing jobs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SolarWorld is the only cell manufacturer in the U.S., so even Mission Solar, SolarCity and Suniva would see higher costs on imported cells if subject to a tariff. If tariffs are put in place on all products from China, there would be a much wider impact to American manufacturing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	China is the lowest-cost source of supply for glass and aluminum for module frames, which are some of the biggest costs in module assembly. Then there&amp;#39;s junction boxes, inverters, racking, connectors, and other balance-of-system components that come from China and other countries in Asia. The U.S. can&amp;#39;t simply flip a switch and start manufacturing these products at scale, especially commodity components like glass or extruded aluminum that are needed in massive quantities. Tariffs on imports from a country like China could give a small boost to U.S. manufacturers, but it would also raise raw material costs for every module manufacturer in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Growing U.S. solar manufacturing jobs isn&amp;#39;t as simple as adding a few tariffs to imports from other countries. The infrastructure to make polysilicon, solar cells, extruded aluminum, junction boxes, glass, and dozens of other components in the U.S. at a cost-effective level simply doesn&amp;#39;t exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to make tariffs stick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The feasibility of tariffs helping U.S. manufacturers may also be wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the solar industry learned one thing from the tariffs on solar cells and modules put in place a few years ago, it&amp;#39;s that suppliers can adapt more quickly than tariffs can. First, manufacturers started &lt;a href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2012/10/solar-panel-tariffs-no-benefit-only-problems.html" target="_blank"&gt;tolling&lt;/a&gt; modules in places like Taiwan and then they began building plants in countries across Southeast Asia. Some of those decisions were even motivated by a drive to find lower costs than China could offer. For example, labor costs in Vietnam &lt;a href="http://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/2015/05/26/the-cost-of-business-in-vietnam-compared-with-china.html"&gt;are now lower&lt;/a&gt; than in China, changing the calculus about where to build manufacturing plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;#39;s consistent with manufacturing expansions in Southeast Asian countries other than China. And the newly diverse set of suppliers and countries of manufacturing in the solar industry would likely mute the effects of any trade war, whether you&amp;#39;re looking from the lens of a U.S. solar manufacturer or an installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, a trade war with China alone would have a minimal impact on U.S. solar manufacturing given its supply diversity today. To have a real impact on the solar industry, the Trump administration would have to start a trade war with all of Southeast Asia. And if that happened, the crossfire would hit nearly everything Americans buy -- not just solar -- creating very unpredictable and very unintended consequences for the solar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Installers -- and U.S. jobs -- would take the brunt of solar tariffs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;#39;s one area of the solar market that will see a negative impact in any trade war: Solar installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Installers who are buying components on the open market will undoubtedly face higher costs. However, the scale of the impact may be different depending on where you sit in the solar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For residential systems, the impact of tariffs would be minimal because most costs are very local in nature. According to GTM Research&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/subscription/u.s.-solar-market-insight"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Market Insight Q4 2016&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of a residential solar system was $2.98 per watt in Q3 2016 -- so the impact of a 25 percent tariff on solar modules alone would be fairly small at just 3 percent of the total installation cost. Tariffs on other components like inverters or mounting brackets may raise costs further, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impact of tariffs would be more meaningful in the utility-scale sector. A $0.10 per watt increase in a fixed-tilt utility project that costs an average of $1.09 per watt would result in a 9 percent increase in costs. And that&amp;#39;s not including any impact from tariffs on inverters, mounting structures, or any other balance-of-system components. This could have a material impact on installers in a low-margin environment. Some solar projects may not pencil out if costs increase by that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tariffs would raise costs for companies installing solar at every scale, from residential rooftops to large utility projects, although the scale of the impact would depend on the scope of tariffs. Rising costs could&amp;nbsp;mean less demand for solar energy at every level, which would also mean less work for installers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Solar Foundation&amp;#39;s National Solar Jobs Census for 2015 estimated that 119,931 workers held jobs installing solar, 57 percent of the 208,859 U.S. solar jobs documented by the organization that year. A reduction in solar energy&amp;#39;s competitiveness could put those jobs at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s impossible to predict the exact impact of tariffs, given how fast costs change in the solar industry. Solar panel prices fell more than $0.10 per watt in the third quarter of 2016 alone -- so a tariff would likely have to be over 25 percent to make installers really worried.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar industry of 2017 is diverse enough to handle one-off tariffs without too much adjustment. And if additional tariffs do come (which is still just speculation), the industry has adapted to bigger disruptions before.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Despite Headwinds, Big Capital Continues to Flow Into Solar Projects, Processes and Startups</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/8r2PZhBiXs8/Despite-Headwinds-Big-Capital-Continues-to-Flow-Into-Solar-Projects-Proce</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Despite-Headwinds-Big-Capital-Continues-to-Flow-Into-Solar-Projects-Proce</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remove incentives for renewable energy. Leave &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; out of the argument entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla" target="_blank"&gt;Eviscerate&lt;/a&gt; the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s renewable programs. Replace science-based policy with &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Trump-Chooses-ExxonMobil-CEO-Rex-Tillerson-as-Secretary-of-State"&gt;oil-buddy&lt;/a&gt; cronyism and a disrespect for &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Hell, make it illegal to deploy renewables, like the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/wyoming-bill-creates-reverse-rps" target="_blank"&gt;lawmakers are trying to do in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg" target="_blank"&gt;Honey badger&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Profit has no political allegiance, and renewables are already winning on sheer economic advantage -- today. GTM Research suggests that occasional &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/10-Solar-Trends-to-Watch-in-2017"&gt;2-cent-per-kilowatt-hour bids&lt;/a&gt; are not out of the question in the coming year and utility fixed-tilt PV system turnkey pricing will land at less than $1.00 per watt in 2017. Solar is cheap and getting cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The headwinds of manufacturing overcapacity, as well as the new U.S. government&amp;#39;s animus toward renewables, has already been baked into the stock price and guidance numbers of the solar industry. In the meantime, financiers are actively investing in solar projects, business processes and new solar companies. Little has slowed down on this front since election day. Here are the more recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	CleanCapital and Generate Capital partner on $300 million in C&amp;amp;I finance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe this is the type of financial facility that can finally jumpstart the stubborn commercial solar market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.cleancapital.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CleanCapital&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.generatecapital.com" target="_blank"&gt;Generate Capital&lt;/a&gt; to drive the acquisition of $300 million of operating clean energy assets -- with "a near-term focus on distributed solar." The idea is to "bring liquidity to the distributed solar market and provide project owners access to permanent, flexible capital and exit opportunities in an otherwise limited market," according to the companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jon Powers, co-founder and chairman of CleanCapital, told GTM that first movers developing distributed generation projects over the last decade "have limited development capital to advance their development pipeline. Opportunities to sell distributed generation assets in this fragmented marketplace remain limited and inefficient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"This is about making it a simple and efficient process for both sellers of projects and investors," said Powers. Kevin Johnson, co-founder and CCO, said the firm allows "investors -- including institutional investors, family offices and funds -- to easily invest in secure and diversified clean energy projects, and simultaneously provides sponsors an easy way to exit clean energy assets." The focus is on operating assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powers said, "If you&amp;#39;re an institutional investor, the due diligence is hard to wrestle with. CleanCapital does that due diligence on C&amp;amp;I projects in a much more efficient way." The firm&amp;#39;s platform is meant to identify, screen and manage clean energy projects for investors, until now limited to "a handful of institutional investors, banks, private equity firms and tax equity investors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar financing startup is something like a YieldCo, but as GTM reported, it&amp;#39;s "more akin to the fintech firms that are making it easier for a broader swath of investors to invest in other markets, like real estate. CleanCapital expects its platform will allow investors to evaluate projects in the pipeline and reduce transactional barriers for investors to put money into solar projects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powers said it was similar to a service like &lt;a href="http://fundrise.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Fundrise&lt;/a&gt;, a technology platform for investing in commercial real estate. CleanCapital is not the only startup taking a fintech approach to solar financing. T-Rex Group is another firm that wants to make renewable financing more transparent and efficient. &lt;a href="http://www.trexgroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;T-Rex&lt;/a&gt; provides enterprise valuation and risk analysis tools for solar projects for both developers and investors. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/From-Shopping-to-Investing-Online-Platforms-Are-Changing-the-Business-of-S"&gt;Open Energy&lt;/a&gt; is another company developing simpler financing tools for commercial solar that are modeled after consumer debt products. Other funds such as &lt;a href="http://www.wundercapital.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Wunder Capital&lt;/a&gt; are also focused on bringing in a more diverse set of investors, particularly smaller ones with as little as $1,000 to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Investors are excited about a rinse-and-repeat opportunity,&amp;rdquo; said Powers. &amp;ldquo;Our homework is to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re bringing them prepared offerings.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This $300 million in funding comes from &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Cleantech-Funding-Train-Keeps-on-Rolling"&gt;Generate Capital&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Jigar Shah, Scott Jacobs and Matan Friedman to provide financing for energy, agriculture and water projects, with $150 million in infrastructure programs in 2015. Generate offers standard financial products, such as asset-backed lending, project finance, asset warehouses and other short-term financing, as well as custom products. Scott Jacobs, CEO of the firm, said, &amp;ldquo;For many years, the market has been crying out for permanent, flexible capital, for transparency in underwriting and for efficiency in transacting, so we designed our business specifically for these purposes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GTM Research&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/time-to-give-small-commercial-solar-more-attention"&gt;Solar Analyst Nicole Litvak&lt;/a&gt; and Generate Capital&amp;#39;s Jigar Shah co-authored an article for GTM in which they wrote, "Despite all of the current market challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that small commercial solar is too big of a market for anyone to pass up. To get the right projects into the hands of the investors who want them, [small and medium-sized business] financiers have to shift from being opportunistic to becoming true &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/small-commercial-financiers-need-to-be-service-providers"&gt;service providers&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		SolarCity&amp;#39;s $145 million securitization, its fifth&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		SolarCity received a &lt;a href="http://https://www.krollbondratings.com/show_report/6122" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary rating&lt;/a&gt; on three classes of notes from bond rating agency &lt;a href="http://www.kbra.com" target="_blank"&gt;Kroll&lt;/a&gt; for a total of $145,000,000 in a residential distributed solar securitization. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/kbra.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		This is SolarCity&amp;#39;s fifth securitization, and it&amp;#39;s secured by a pool of 9,609 solar loans distributed across 14 states. The weighted average FICO score of the "obligors" is 728. According to Kroll, "The transaction benefits from credit enhancement in the form of over-collateralization, excess cash flow, an interest reserve account and an inverter replacement reserve account."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Nearly 4 gigawatts of wind and solar projects&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		According to Credit Suisse, "Nearly 4 gigawatts of wind and solar projects and project pipelines traded hands [last] week."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Spruce to drive $445 million in residential solar&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.pv-tech.org/news/spruce-secures-us445-million-in-debt-financing-for-residential-pv-systems" target="_blank"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://solarindustrymag.com/spruce-finance-raises-capital-to-back-more-residential-solar?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=LNH+01-20-2017&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SI+Latest+News+Headlines" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, Spruce Finance, a financier of home solar and energy-efficiency measures, raised enough tax equity and debt to drive $445 million in residential photovoltaic power purchase agreements and leases in 2017. Spruce also closed a $105 million "back leverage facility against existing projects" led by Investec and Silicon Valley Bank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		SolarReserve gains $78 million tax equity investment&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Concentrating-Solar-Power-Isnt-Worth-Much-Without-Storage-Say-Leading-Exe"&gt;SolarReserve&lt;/a&gt; won a $78 million tax equity investment from Capital One for its 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Project, a utility-scale concentrated solar plant employing molten salt energy storage, enabling 24-hour operation. The facility generates 110 megawatts of electricity plus 1,100 megawatt-hours of energy storage to NV Energy under a 25-year power-purchase agreement, according to the company. SolarReserve, along with investors ACS Cobra and Santander, will maintain an ownership stake. In 2015, SolarReserve won approval to build a 260-megawatt tower project with storage in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Schneider Electric buys Renewable Choice Energy&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://bizwest.com/216491-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Schneider Electric&lt;/a&gt;, French energy management and automation giant, acquired &lt;a href="http://se-library.com/Flash-News_Schneider-Electric-Renewable-Choice.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Renewable Choice Energy&lt;/a&gt;, a C&amp;amp;I renewable project developer and renewable energy advisory platform. Details of the transaction were not disclosed. Renewable Choice&amp;#39;s clients include 160 of the Fortune 500 companies. Schneider acquired Summit Energy Services, a provider of outsourced energy procurement and sustainability services to C&amp;amp;I and MUSH markets, in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		D.light raised $10.5 million more for off-grid solar&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.dlight.com/" target="_blank"&gt;D.light&lt;/a&gt;, furnishing and financing off-grid solar lighting products, added $10.5 million in funding from &lt;a href="http://www.norfund.no" target="_blank"&gt;Norfund&lt;/a&gt;, Beyond the Grid, and Shell Foundation. The company claims to sell hundreds of thousands of units per month with a "commanding market share in emerging markets" and a focus on Africa and Asia. The company has raised &lt;a href="http://www.dlight.com/files/5314/8455/3781/dlightFundingPressRelease-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more than $40 million&lt;/a&gt; over the last four months. As GTM has reported, solar-powered lanterns equipped with LEDs have &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-lighting-has-eliminated-about-20-million-kerosene-lanterns"&gt;eliminated more than 20 million&lt;/a&gt; traditional lighting sources, primarily kerosene lanterns.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Doerr and Rodgers invest $10 million in Enphase&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		T.J. Rodgers, founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and John Doerr, chairman of Kleiner Perkins, have emerged as white-knight saviors for troubled solar microinverter firm &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Silicon-Valleys-John-Doerr-and-TJ-Rodgers-Invest-10M-in-Enphases-Microin"&gt;Enphase&lt;/a&gt;. The Silicon Valley icons are investing $10 million in the firm, and Rodgers is joining the board of directors. It&amp;#39;s a bit of an unusual move for this odd couple. Kleiner was an investor in Enphase under the normal order of things, back when it was a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Doerr has invested in some of venture capital&amp;#39;s most famous successes (Google, Amazon, Sun, Intuit), as well as in some less than successful efforts (GO Corporation, MyCFO, Segway). He spearheaded KPCB&amp;#39;s investment efforts in greentech, including funding Silver Spring Networks, Fisker Automotive, Bloom Energy, Opower and Proterra. T.J. Rodgers is the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, a force in Silicon Valley, an early equity investor in SunPower, and a vintner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;
		Solar developer Silicon Ranch raised $55 million&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.siliconranchcorp.com"&gt;Silicon Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a developer, owner and operator of solar energy plants, closed on an equity round of more than $55 million led by &lt;a href="http://www.partnersgroup.com" target="_blank"&gt;Partners Group&lt;/a&gt;, and joined by Silicon Ranch shareholders including the Greystone Infrastructure Fund. Silicon Ranch develops-to-own all of its projects and attracted more than $165 million of new equity capital last year. Silicon Ranch built the first large-scale solar projects in Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Trump Administration Scrubs Mentions of Climate and Renewables From White House Website</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/2j0BYNA-axw/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A change has come to Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Immediately after Donald Trump assumed the office of president Friday, the presidential URL changed. Where there once was "Energy," now there is "&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;An America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;." And where there once was a climate action plan, now there is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;no mention of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The social cost of carbon -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/oira/social-cost-of-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;. The Clean Power Plan -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-record/climate" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vestigial page titles still appear in a Google search, but the links lead nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During and after the election, Trump had spoken derisively of federal efforts to combat climate change, but had also signaled a willingness to embrace renewables as a domestically produced energy source and jobs driver. After months of speculation about how Trump would act toward clean energy once in office, the administration has clearly signaled its intent to erase President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s clean energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Obama-era website lives on &lt;a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so the content itself will not be lost. The scrubbing, though, indicates that the peaceful transition of power need not coincide with a continuity of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt; lays out a new course: "President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Right there, as explicitly as it can be written: The Trump administration plans to kill Obama&amp;#39;s climate policies. And it starts with the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A search within the site for the phrase "climate change" turns up one page, a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/mamieeisenhower" target="_blank"&gt;biography of former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;. The article references the climate of San Antonio, as well as the word "changes" in a non-climatic context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plan also asserts the value of domestic energy production: "In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America&amp;rsquo;s national security interest." The policy lists the domestic energy sources that qualify:&amp;nbsp;shale, oil, natural gas and coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean coal technology, which is only just beginning to prove itself at commercial scale, gets a shout-out. But renewables, which accounted for &lt;a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29492"&gt;the majority of new energy capacity&lt;/a&gt; added last year, don&amp;#39;t earn a mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While declaring a need to develop energy at home and cast off the nation&amp;#39;s dependence on oil cartel OPEC, the statement also makes an ominous reference to expansion abroad: "At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy." This presages a strategy of fossil-fuel exploration not just at home, but overseas, replacing Paris treaty climate commitments with help for new drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even basic landing pages for White House organizational divisions have disappeared. Try searching for the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq" target="_blank"&gt;Council on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Science and Technology Policy&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the landing page for Statements and Releases from the Press Office has gone blank, so a casual reader won&amp;#39;t stumble upon any mentions of the danger of climate change or the jobs created by the clean energy industry while scrolling back through the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of the Environmental Protection Agency, which crafted the CPP, had not been touched as of this writing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean energy industry groups are gearing up to pitch wind and solar as major job creators. They&amp;#39;ll have their work cut out for them to even gain recognition in the new president&amp;#39;s energy policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Rick Perry Pledges Support for DOE Research, Renewables as Trump Plans Drastic Agency Cuts</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/J_FyoHn3iUw/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Former Texas Governor Rick Perry kicked off his confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Energy this morning by reversing his position on eliminating the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,&amp;rdquo; Perry said. &amp;ldquo;In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perry committed to pursuing a true all-of-the-above energy plan, including the advancement of renewables. In another significant policy reversal, he said he believes humans do play some role in influencing the climate. Perry also underscored that he will protect science and support research to bring new technologies to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	President-elect Donald Trump may have other plans, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hours before Perry made his comments to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, The Hill &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; on Trump&amp;rsquo;s proposal to slash government spending, including dramatic cuts to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Trump team&amp;rsquo;s budget blueprint, informed by The Heritage Foundation, would &amp;ldquo;roll back funding for nuclear physics and advanced scientific computing research to 2008 levels, eliminate the Office of Electricity, eliminate the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and scrap the Office of Fossil Energy, which focuses on technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,&amp;rdquo; The Hill reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Senator Debbie Stabenow&amp;nbsp;(D-Mich.) was the first to question Perry on the Trump budget proposal, which he seemed to have little or no awareness of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Just because it&amp;rsquo;s on the internet doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s true,&amp;rdquo; Perry joked. He added that he views supercomputing as &amp;ldquo;incredibly important for this country&amp;rsquo;s security,&amp;rdquo; and reiterated his commitment to making decisions based on sound scientific and economic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) brought up the Trump budget again, noting the proposed DOE cuts would make it nearly impossible to pursue an all-of-the-above strategy. Perry responded that perhaps the Trump team &amp;ldquo;will have the same experience I had and forget that they said that,&amp;rdquo; referring to the time he forgot the DOE&amp;rsquo;s name during a debate, while vowing to cut the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Senators Al Franken (D-Minn.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) also raised the issue of Trump&amp;rsquo;s proposed DOE budget cuts during Perry&amp;rsquo;s hearing. Perry said he has a history of defending budgets from his time serving as a budget appropriator in Texas. He said he would also defend the functions of the Office of Electricity, even if those efforts took a different name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I am committed to the continuation of using brilliant scientists, the private sector and universities in collaborating on finding solutions to challenges&amp;hellip;whether on renewables or use of resources in a more efficient, safe, effective manner,&amp;rdquo; Perry said, while being questioned by Sen. Duckworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re counting on you,&amp;rdquo; Hirono said during the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>How the Solar Industry Can Cut Stubborn Soft Costs With E-Commerce</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/RGkIu60haU4/how-the-solar-industry-can-cut-soft-costs-with-ecommerce</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-the-solar-industry-can-cut-soft-costs-with-ecommerce</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the rollicking solar industry of the past decade, change and upheaval have been the norm. There have been attacks on net metering, trade wars, technology developments, not to mention perpetual uncertainty about the federal Investment Tax Credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet through the turbulence there has been one constant: Prices for solar hardware have continued their steady trajectory downward. In February 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy reported that the average cost of solar panels had dropped 60 percent since the beginning of 2010. This consistent drop in module prices -- one that is &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Report-How-much-does-a-solar-PV-system-cost-in-2016"&gt;continuing apace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;-- &amp;nbsp;has been accompanied by falling prices for inverters and trackers. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While critical, the cost of hardware is only part of the story -- arguably, it&amp;rsquo;s less than half of the story. According to the DOE, soft costs account for 64 percent of the total price of U.S. residential solar systems.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Stubborn soft costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The trends in soft costs -- which refer to everything from customer acquisition and supply chain expenses to taxes, fees and labor -- are not nearly as encouraging as cost trends in hardware. For example, a recent report from GTM Research, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/us-solar-pv-system-pricing-h2-2016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. PV System Pricing H2: System Pricing, Breakdowns and Forecasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that customer acquisition costs actually grew by 10 percent in the second half of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This challenge is not a mystery to those in the industry. The DOE&amp;rsquo;s SunShot Initiative, for example, has a multi-pronged program designed at lowering soft costs. One strategy SunShot employs is supporting business-model and technology innovators able to cut through some of the inefficiencies that add costs to solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both SunShot and venture capitalists have provided funding for entrepreneurs who have utilized software and e-commerce as a weapon in the battle against soft costs. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.energysage.com/press/energysage-awarded-doe-sunshot-initiative-award"&gt;EnergySage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Geostellar-Lands-7M-in-VC-to-Optimize-Selling-Residential-Solar-Rooftops"&gt;Geostellar&lt;/a&gt;, which both use online platforms to reduce customer acquisition costs, have attracted millions in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another SunShot grant recipient, &lt;a href="https://energybin.com" target="_blank"&gt;EnergyBin&lt;/a&gt;, is also harnessing the power of software and e-commerce to create an online business-to-business marketplace that could further reduce soft costs and improve the economics of solar companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept behind EnergyBin is straightforward: to create a B2B centralized members-only online marketplace where industry players -- everyone from large manufacturers and developers to small installers -- can buy and sell new and used components quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	From IT to solar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept behind EnergyBin has already succeeded in the IT world. EnergyBin&amp;rsquo;s parent company, Broker Exchange, and sister company, &lt;a href="http://www.brokerbin.com" target="_blank"&gt;BrokerBin&lt;/a&gt;, were founded in 2002 as a centralized marketplace where companies big and small can buy and sell routers, servers, motherboards and other computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moving from IT to solar felt like a natural evolution. &amp;ldquo;We were looking for an early-stage market, rapid growth, [one that is] scalable, and most importantly...the emergence of a B2B broker market for new, excess, used, refurbished and vintage components,&amp;rdquo; said Doug Westra, EnergyBin&amp;rsquo;s CFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although BrokerBin has 3,500 member companies in 63 countries and more than 12 million items for sale today, &amp;ldquo;We see the renewable and solar marketplace opportunity as big, if not bigger, than the IT side,&amp;rdquo; added Westra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar industry suffers from some expensive supply chain and communication inefficiencies that a centralized marketplace could help address. &amp;ldquo;What I saw happening in the industry was project estimators and procurement teams spending large amounts of time working their network to obtain what they believed to be the best possible component price for their estimates,&amp;rdquo; said Keith Bluford, senior vice president of business development at EnergyBin, who previously worked for solar developer Sunora Energy Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;They believed they were getting the best pricing, but were they, based on having limited vision into the overall supply chain?&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;There was no real way for organizations to efficiently and cost-effectively communicate with anyone other than those in their siloed network to buy or sell solar components.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Promoting transparency and a second life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a centralized marketplace that includes a critical mass of stakeholders in the solar supply chain, transparency around pricing, location and availability becomes possible and information silos can be broken down. When the marketplace is made up of both industry behemoths and mom-and-pop installers, a centralized platform means all members, no matter their size, should benefit from the visibility and access to the entire solar supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are other reasons that a quickly growing -- yet still very young -- solar industry can benefit from a more efficient supply chain and communication channel. The dramatic decline of solar hardware costs has led to a global building binge of new solar projects. But as the industry ages, there will be a large market for used equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From utility to residential, there is a developing marketplace for what happens with the second life of components,&amp;rdquo; said Bluford. Given the volatility of the solar market, the issue of the second life is complicated by companies that have gone out of business. Plenty of installers chose equipment from companies that no longer exist, and a marketplace that connects them to suppliers of used equipment can be a big benefit. That&amp;rsquo;s especially true when those used components come with added value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Like in other markets, when you have equipment that is coming back for a second life, there is going to be a refurbished marketplace and vendors that will provide warranties around that equipment,&amp;rdquo; said Bluford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A tool that can evolve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EnergyBin&amp;rsquo;s first priority after launch was to ensure easy community-wide communication between buyers and sellers, such as being able to create a list of components that you are looking to buy or sell and easily broadcast it to the entire community. Now the focus is on more advanced searches and keeping information current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We know those are keys to the platform and the success of the community,&amp;rdquo; Bluford said. &amp;ldquo;People want to know when they&amp;rsquo;re looking for something that the inventory is current, and people want to know they can easily upload and manage inventory that they are looking to monetize. The tool has to be intuitive and easy to use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But just as the solar industry is quickly evolving, Bluford insists that EnergyBin will be every bit as nimble -- thanks in large part to the lessons learned at BrokerBin as well as the guidance and assistance of EnergyBin&amp;rsquo;s solar industry advisory board and flagship member companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other features are ready to be deployed. At the moment, the company is concentrating resources and attention on improving the platform&amp;#39;s technical specification library, market intelligence database and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another coming feature is called "part history," which has proven to be very valuable on BrokerBin. &amp;ldquo;You can click on an icon or graph...[to] pop up the history of that part from 30, 60, 90 days out, detailing the supply and demand for that specific part as well as the pricing and how many people have searched for it,&amp;rdquo; said Renee Kuehl, EnergyBin&amp;rsquo;s vice president of sales and marketing. Other coming features could include geolocation and enhanced mobile capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The EnergyBin platform is positioning itself to be part of a larger evolution in the solar marketplace toward increased sophistication, efficiency and stronger connections. As that happens, soft costs should move downward, more in parallel with the costs of modules and inverters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a paradigm shift in how the industry is doing business today, which is in silos,&amp;rdquo; said Bluford. &amp;ldquo;This is a shift to having a centralized community and a platform that provides the tools necessary for all members of the supply chain to communicate directly with each other. It&amp;rsquo;s really about bringing the solar supply chain together under one network and changing how they&amp;rsquo;re doing business today, which will ultimately affect how efficient they are and push down the soft costs in a number of areas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>America Is Losing the Energy Innovation Race. Trump Can Help Win It</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/8TZKEOn6Tec/america-is-losing-the-energy-innovation-race-trump-can-help-win-it</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/america-is-losing-the-energy-innovation-race-trump-can-help-win-it</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. is losing the race on clean energy innovation, despite President Obama&amp;rsquo;s efforts to boost competitiveness in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to a recent Bloomberg New Energy Finance study, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/global-clean-energy-investment-dropped-18-in-2016-with-slowdown-from-china"&gt;China invested $287.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in clean energy in 2016, while the U.S. spent $58.6 billion. Earlier this month, China&amp;rsquo;s energy agency announced a plan to spend more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/asia/china-renewable-energy-investment.html?_r=0"&gt;$360 billion&lt;/a&gt; on renewable power sources like solar and wind through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Donald Trump assumes the presidency, he has an opportunity to improve on President Obama&amp;rsquo;s clean energy legacy -- and possibly create thousands of jobs in the process. But it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if he sees this as an opportunity at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The word &amp;ldquo;innovation&amp;rdquo; came up numerous times during Trump&amp;rsquo;s transition into the White House. "We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation," the president-elect told Silicon Valley tech leaders, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/will-elon-musk-be-the-champion-cleantech-needs-at-the-white-house"&gt;including Tesla CEO Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tech-roundtable-musk-bezos-532040" target="_blank"&gt;at a meeting&lt;/a&gt; in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same meeting, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m super excited about the possibility that this could be the innovations administration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bill Gates, who recently launched a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-12/bill-gates-pushes-green-energy-on-call-with-trump-while-building-1-billion-fund" target="_blank"&gt;$1 billion clean energy technology fund&lt;/a&gt;, said he emphasized there is &amp;ldquo;opportunity for innovation in not only energy, but also medicine and education,&amp;rdquo; at a recent meeting with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this month, several lawmakers participated in a &lt;a href="http://www.ces.tech/Events-Programs/Live-Streamed-Events/Innovation-Policy-Live-Stream.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;panel discussion&lt;/a&gt; at the Consumer Electronics Show, where Republican speakers underscored their party&amp;rsquo;s commitment to &amp;ldquo;innovation policy.&amp;rdquo; At the event, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) noted that Trump doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a strong personal interest in technology, but has made a point of surrounding himself with talented, tech-savvy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And when it comes to Trump&amp;rsquo;s pick to lead the Department of Energy, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/310200-rick-perry-will-breathe-life-into-department-of-energy" target="_blank"&gt;some supporters&lt;/a&gt; have said they believe innovation will be the hallmark of his tenure, if he is approved. In the past, Perry has said that energy innovation, including in the areas of energy storage and solar power, is one of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://climateone.org/video/rick-perry-energy-innovation" target="_blank"&gt;the most exciting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; developments in the country. At his confirmation hearing this morning, Perry pledged &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/doe-nominee-rick-perry-vows-to-support-research-and-renewables-as-trump-pla"&gt;support for DOE research and clean energy&lt;/a&gt; programs, although his comments were overshadowed by a budget cut proposal from Trump headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it remains unclear what the Trump administration and new Republican-led Congress will ultimately prioritize, the messaging around invention and technology in the early days of the Trump transition may come as welcome sign to many in the clean energy sector. Could the new government&amp;rsquo;s interest in growing businesses and creating jobs be a boon for clean energy after all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Asian countries out-invest the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://itif.org/publications/2016/12/13/energy-innovation-policy-priorities-trump-administration-and-congress" target="_blank"&gt;A recent paper&lt;/a&gt; released by the Information Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Foundation (ITIF) argues that next-generation energy technologies are fueling economic growth at home and expanding exports abroad. However, the U.S. is falling behind in the race to capitalize on the burgeoning clean energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the paper, 11 other countries around the world spend more on energy R&amp;amp;D as a percentage of GDP than does the United States. China spends three times as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Private investments in energy innovation have been weak as well. Venture capital and private equity investment in American renewable-energy companies, for instance, peaked in 2008 at $5.4 billion and dropped to $2.2 billion in 2015. Just a handful of U.S. companies have raised enough private capital to develop advanced nuclear reactors and carbon-capture technologies, while China offers strong support on all of these technology fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="/content/images/articles/ITIF_graph.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Source: ITIF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A separate study from Bloomberg New Energy Finance found the overall cleantech investment gap to be even more dramatic. China spent $287.5 billion on clean energy in 2016, while the U.S. spent $58.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The United States is losing this race because Asian countries are out-investing the United States and dictating the terms of competition, often flooding the market with low-cost, unimaginative products,&amp;rdquo; the ITIF report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the U.S. to regain its leadership position, ITIF calls on Trump and the 115th Congress to &amp;ldquo;make energy innovation a high priority and address the obstacles to developing and deploying new technologies.&amp;rdquo; The paper goes on to list how this could be achieved, with a particular focus on changes at the Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But does Trump&amp;rsquo;s view of innovation include making these types of reforms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the four years since he was elected in 2012, I would say Obama viewed his legacy as climate and clean energy,&amp;rdquo; said former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, speaking at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) annual meeting last fall. &amp;ldquo;We will not see...a continuation of the Obama legacy. Then the question becomes, how much is it a reversal as opposed to some kind of a course correction?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	How to make the DOE more effective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Trump transition got off to a rocky start at the DOE with the circulation of a &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-trump-team-wants-names-of-people-working-on-climate" target="_blank"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; 74-question survey. The questionnaire hinted at the priorities of Trump&amp;rsquo;s energy transition team, which is led by Thomas Pyle, who runs the Institute for Energy Research and the American Energy Alliance -- both of which are primarily funded by fossil-fuel interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several questions asked for information about the status of the DOE&amp;rsquo;s loan program; there was a question about technologies or products that have emerged from DOE programs that are commercially available without any subsidy; and there was a question about how the U.S. can optimize its advanced nuclear reactor research and development activities. These and other inquiries suggest the Trump administration will reform the DOE&amp;rsquo;s investments in emerging clean technologies, including electric vehicles and renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to sources familiar with the matter, the first transition meeting at the DOE&amp;rsquo;s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewables focused on three topics: consumer choice, the proper role of the government, and how the DOE determines what to work on. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear what will emerge from those discussions following this weekend&amp;rsquo;s inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changes at the DOE are significant for the overall clean energy industry because the barriers to market entry are so high, said David Hart, a senior fellow at ITIF. New technologies often have to compete with commodity providers, which means they have to hit stringent price targets. They also have to prove they&amp;rsquo;re highly reliable, which means the innovation process can take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DOE &amp;nbsp;has played a key role in both the early-stage development and commercialization phases of today&amp;rsquo;s clean energy technologies. For instance, more than half of all solar cell efficiency records have been directly funded by the DOE&amp;rsquo;s SunShot Initiative. Furthermore, SunShot&amp;rsquo;s incubator program supported 112 companies with $158 million, and those companies went on to raise more than $3.4 billion from separate sources -- a $22 return for $1 in public investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But DOE&amp;rsquo;s work could still be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="/content/images/articles/Sunshot_graph.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The DOE isn&amp;rsquo;t as effective as it could be at playing these various roles, but the Obama administration tried things that were creative, and I think the objective should be to build on those efforts...and expand the level of investment,&amp;rdquo; said Hart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One mission the Trump administration could take on is to reorient the national laboratories to pursue commercially relevant RD&amp;amp;D. According to ITIF, that requires setting up &amp;ldquo;lab-to-market&amp;rdquo; programs to turn research results into practical applications. It also requires giving labs more autonomy. To facilitate that, the next Energy Secretary should increase the scale of Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from 4 percent to 6 percent of total lab spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hart said that ARPA-E, which enjoys bipartisan support, should also be maintained and expanded. The Trump administration should also do more to encourage private investment in energy innovation. Venture capital investment has receded, while corporate expenditure on both in-house and external R&amp;amp;D has stagnated. &amp;ldquo;A priority for the new Congress and administration should be to reverse these trends,&amp;rdquo; according to the ITIF report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Trump administration can also improve on programs that floundered under Obama. According to Hart, the DOE didn&amp;rsquo;t do enough technology demonstrations during Obama&amp;rsquo;s tenure, particularly with respect for nuclear and carbon-capture technologies. Those technologies were likely neglected because they are particularly rife with challenges, Hart said -- &amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can give up on them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It could also continue matching supply push policies with demand pull policies, to bring more technology into the market. The Department of Defense and the General Services Administration have been leaders on this. &amp;ldquo;Subsidies of infinite duration are not acceptable,&amp;rdquo; the report states. &amp;ldquo;The creation of temporary protected market niches, however, may be vital in bringing costs down while production ramps up, and in providing working capital to early-stage firms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ITIF isn&amp;rsquo;t the only group urging Trump to help American win the energy innovation race. A group of graduate students &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/tomorrows-energy-leaders-call-for-leadership-from-trump-today"&gt;wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Trump this week, calling on the new president to recognize the economic power of clean energy, and continue to offer policy support. Academics have made &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/our-energy-future-with-a-trump-presidency-a-letter-to-the-energy-rd-communi"&gt;similar appeals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During this time of transitioning federal policy objectives, I and many of my fellow business students hope to see the Trump administration maintain if not strengthen our country&amp;rsquo;s commitment to progress in the energy industry,&amp;rdquo; said Kristofer Holz, a graduate student at the Yale School of Management and the School of Forestry &amp;amp; Environmental Studies. &amp;ldquo;DOE RD&amp;amp;D programs that support entrepreneurs and attract private capital by de-risking novel technologies are critical to maintaining American prominence in the global cleantech conversation, launching the innovative companies that many MBAs hope to work for upon graduation, and helping the Trump administration revitalize American manufacturing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Innovation from a conservative viewpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following Trump&amp;rsquo;s election, many people in the clean energy industry made the case that the sector would not be affected by the Trump administration. Clean energy is on a roll, as President Obama detailed in &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Obama-Makes-His-Final-Case-for-Clean-Energy-as-President"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt;. Clean energy is also &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Grid-Modernization-Created-Over-100000-American-Jobs"&gt;creating jobs&lt;/a&gt; -- so what&amp;rsquo;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On this, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that some conservative groups have a different view of what innovation means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following Trump&amp;rsquo;s election, The Heartland Institute&amp;rsquo;s Paul Driessen cheered unleashing America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;energy, innovation, and job-creation capabilities -- by reducing taxes and regulations and appointing agency directors who can and will review, revise, and reject the economy- and job-killing regulatory edicts that ignored real-world science.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Devin Hartman, electricity policy manager at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit promoting limited government, said he was encouraged by the &amp;ldquo;pro-market&amp;rdquo; disposition of Trump&amp;rsquo;s appointees and the opportunity to promote competitive energy markets by unwinding the subsidy regime. &amp;ldquo;But to do so, they&amp;#39;ll have to avoid the temptation of adopting counter-industrial policy that picks different winners than the current administration,&amp;rdquo; he wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultimately, this pro-market stance could make it easier for the U.S. to adopt a price on carbon, Hartman added. &amp;ldquo;While the near-term outlook for emission pricing is bleak, if we strengthen competitive markets in the meantime, we&amp;#39;ll be in much better position for the market to respond effectively once emissions pricing becomes reality,&amp;rdquo; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many economists believe putting a price on carbon will &lt;a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/carbon-pricing-incentivizes-clean-energy-innovation" target="_blank"&gt;spur innovation&lt;/a&gt; in clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a libertarian advocacy group, has also listed innovation as a top priority. Last month, the group issued a memo calling for Trump to support new technologies by committing to 1) do no harm; 2) be patient; and 3) embrace change. That prescription did not extend to clean energy, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;President Trump should also avoid seeking to win favor with the tech sector by offering federal &amp;lsquo;help&amp;rsquo; through federal subsidies, favors, and steering, such as President Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;manufacturing hubs,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obama launched a network of manufacturing hubs in 2012 with the aim of promoting cutting-edge technologies for the next generation of manufacturing jobs. The program has been instrumental in advancing clean energy, such as with the development of &lt;a href="https://www.poweramericainstitute.org" target="_blank"&gt;advanced semiconductor components&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://https://energy.gov/eere/amo/institute-advanced-composites-manufacturing-innovation" target="_blank"&gt;advanced composites&lt;/a&gt;. Last June, Obama announced a new &lt;a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/pacific-northwest-selected-as-regional-hub-for-new-smart-manufacturing-institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Northwest to accelerate the development and adoption of advanced sensors, data analytics and controls. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if or how the new administration will support such programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to opposing the manufacturing hubs, &lt;a href="https://cei.org/blog/new-york-times-misleads-us-china-renewable-energy-trade" target="_blank"&gt;CEI rejects the notion that there is a &amp;ldquo;clean energy race&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; taking place between the U.S. and China. In a recent blog post, CEI&amp;rsquo;s William Yeatman challenged a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; story that reported China&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bold claim on leadership&amp;rdquo; in clean energy with a plan to spend more than $360 billion on renewable power sources like solar and wind through 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Unfortunately for the green energy industry, political winds are quick to change. As costs mount, politicians will rescind the government&amp;rsquo;s support, and markets will crash,&amp;rdquo; Yeatman wrote. &amp;ldquo;When the renewable energy bubble bursts, the global industry leader will be the biggest loser. With that in mind, the supposed race with China for green technological supremacy is one the U.S. would be wise to forfeit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As he takes office, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if Trump even believes there&amp;rsquo;s a clean energy innovation competition worth trying to win. But reports suggest that the White House may back away from the sector. According to the website The Hill, the administration is &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;considering slashing funding&lt;/a&gt; for nuclear physics and completely eliminating the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of Electricity, and the Office of Fossil Energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>First Solar Proves That PV Plants Can Rival Frequency Response Services From Natural Gas Peakers</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_Solar/~3/P5jN243Ne8g/PV-Plants-Can-Rival-Frequency-Response-Services-From-Natural-Gas-Peakers</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/PV-Plants-Can-Rival-Frequency-Response-Services-From-Natural-Gas-Peakers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Last summer, First Solar and California grid operator CAISO ran a set of tests to show that utility-scale solar PV, instead of being a disruptive influence on the power grid, could actually help stabilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a series of days in August, First Solar slightly curtailed power output at a 300-megawatt solar farm in California, enabled its array of inverters, and plugged into CAISO&amp;rsquo;s system. It then orchestrated the plant&amp;rsquo;s output to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s automatic generation control (AGC) signals, respond to its frequency regulation commands, and use inverters for voltage regulation, power factor regulation and reactive power control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results, according to &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/UsingRenewablesToOperateLowCarbonGrid-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; released last week, showed that First Solar was able to meet, and sometimes exceed, the frequency regulation response usually provided by natural-gas-fired peaker plants. First Solar was also able to provide inverter-based services throughout the day -- and possibly even at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turned in a respectable performance matching CAISO&amp;rsquo;s wholesale market price signals -- even when clouds appeared on the afternoon of the second day of testing, reducing First Solar&amp;rsquo;s capacity to shift its load.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told, the data from CAISO, First Solar and the Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) indicates that a utility-scale solar farm, equipped with standard inverters and software controls, can serve to smooth out grid fluctuations from the solar itself or from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And for California, a state with 9,000 megawatts of &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/8minutenergy-Boasts-the-First-Solar-PPA-to-Beat-Fossil-Fuel-Prices-in-Calif"&gt;transmission-connected solar&lt;/a&gt; and plans for 20,000 megawatts more by 2030, that could be a valuable resource. &amp;ldquo;If PV-generated power can offer a supportive product that benefits the power system and is economic for PV power plant owners and customers, this functionality should be recognized and encouraged,&amp;rdquo; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utility-scale solar PV is already causing California some grid challenges, in the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-california-duck-curve-is-real-and-bigger-than-expected"&gt;form of the duck curve&lt;/a&gt; -- a deep midday drop in net load driven by lots of solar flooding onto the grid, and a steep ramp-up starting in the late afternoon that extends into evening as solar fades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO is also experiencing &amp;ldquo;periods of oversupply conditions, especially pronounced during weekends when electricity demand is low and renewable production is high.&amp;rdquo; Currently, when faced with potentially destabilizing conditions like this, CAISO has no choice but to curtail renewable power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Significant levels of renewables curtailment took place during certain days of the spring of 2016,&amp;rdquo; the report noted, including one day in late April when more than 2,000 megawatts of renewable generation had to be taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_Curtailment_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 370px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Given the alternative of curtailment, operators of utility-scale solar may find it advantageous to curtail power slightly in advance, in order to provide "headroom" to move up and down to meet grid needs. That&amp;#39;s what First Solar did on two days in August, and the data shows that it was able to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s AGC signal and provide &amp;ldquo;fast and accurate AGC performance&amp;hellip;at different solar resource conditions.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_AGCchart_midday_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The only blips came in the afternoon, when clouds passed over the plant, reducing First Solar&amp;rsquo;s output and shrinking the headroom needed to maneuver. &amp;ldquo;However, even during these periods the plant was demonstrating good AGC performance by closely following the commanded set point,&amp;rdquo; according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_AGCchart_clouds_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 289px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where PV and inverters really shine, however, is in frequency regulation, with inverters that can respond much more quickly than spinning generators. &amp;ldquo;The plant demonstrated fast and accurate frequency-response performance for different droop settings (3% and 5%) under various solar resource conditions for both under and over-frequency events,&amp;rdquo; the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO has been &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/In-California-Solar-and-Wind-Boosts-the-Price-for-Frequency-Regulation"&gt;increasing its payouts for frequency regulation&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, in part to manage the grid instabilities that come with an increasing share of intermittent wind and solar power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_RegChart_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 336px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, looking at the test data, &amp;ldquo;a conclusion can be made that regulation accuracy by PV plant is about 24-30 points better than fast gas turbine technologies.&amp;rdquo; CAISO is working on implementing national rules that require grid operators to reward fast-responding frequency regulation assets, such as grid-tied batteries, electric vehicles, fast demand response, or, in this case, solar farm inverters, and &amp;ldquo;data from these tests will be used by the CAISO in future ancillary service market design,&amp;rdquo; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the PV control capabilities used by First Solar and CAISO are technically feasible today and &amp;ldquo;a few areas throughout the world have already started to request or require PV power plants to provide some of them,&amp;rdquo; the report said. One example is Hawaii, with utility-integrated projects like the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/aes-puts-energy-heavy-battery-behind-new-kauai-solar-peaker"&gt;SolarCity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/aes-puts-energy-heavy-battery-behind-new-kauai-solar-peaker"&gt;AES Energy Storage&lt;/a&gt; are building on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"In the United States, utility-scale PV plants are rarely recognized as having these capabilities and typically are not used by utilities or system operators for electrical grid services.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s largely because the economic and regulatory models for rewarding it aren&amp;rsquo;t in place yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s important, because the kinds of tasks First Solar performed last summer required it to curtail overall output, to offer some &amp;ldquo;headroom&amp;rdquo; to make changes according to CAISO&amp;rsquo;s commands. For example, it curtailed output by 30 megawatts, or about 10 percent, to give it maneuverability to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s AGC signal -- although &amp;nbsp;the report noted that &amp;ldquo;relatively small and short-term energy storage&amp;rdquo; could help mitigate cloud impact and other uncertainties in that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are examples of utilities rewarding solar and wind power for curtailing their power based on AGC signals. The Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCO), for example, can use wind reserves, which sometimes make up 60 percent of generation in its system, as an ancillary service for frequency regulation, the report noted. &amp;ldquo;Similar services can be provided by curtailed PV power plants in California; however, regulatory, market, and operational issues need to be resolved for this to become possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First Solar also had to curtail output to provide frequency regulation, although just how much it would need to curtail would depend on what its service might be worth in CAISO&amp;rsquo;s coming market redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO, NREL and First Solar are planning to explore the &amp;ldquo;economic and/or contractual incentives to maximize production and not hold back production to provide reliability services&amp;rdquo; as one of the next steps in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
