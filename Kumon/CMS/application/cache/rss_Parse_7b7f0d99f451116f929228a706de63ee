            <title>Get Back to the Basics for Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/8/26/3086212d-6d5a-4e01-8693-56847dbe0363_continuous-improvement.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 256px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Have you ever watched a child learning to ride a bike? Who (or what) gets the blame when things don&amp;#39;t go the way the child wants? The bike! The child might even argue that it&amp;#39;s a stupid bike and impossible to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does this have to do with organizations wanting to succeed in continuous improvement? Grownups at work don&amp;#39;t behave like that, do they? No, there is a crucial difference. The child must learn to ride the bike he or she has, while many organizations choose to invest in a new bike with more features in the naive belief that it will make their employees better cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The child eventually realizes that the problem has nothing to do with the bike but rather his or her own attitude and ability, while the people of the organization continue to live in denial. In the end, the child learns to ride the bike &amp;ndash; the approach leads to the desired outcome. Meanwhile, the organization is soon cluttered with lots of old and &amp;quot;useless&amp;quot; bikes. With each new bike, it becomes more difficult to learn how to ride it &amp;ndash; the approach leads away from the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does the child have that the organization lacks? Someone who lets the child know (in a loving way) that there is nothing wrong with the bike. In many organizations, workers are often quick to agree when someone blames the bike. When the bike is targeted, you don&amp;#39;t have to approach the real reasons for the undesired results: your own shortcomings. The child, however, will have to confront his or her fear and inadequacy. That&amp;#39;s when the miracle of learning, increased self-confidence and improved ability happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what can you do to reclaim the &amp;quot;passion for riding a bike&amp;quot; in an organization with a distorted self-image and a bike that feels too big? First, throw out all fancy and advanced racing bikes and dust off the tricycle. In other words, get back to the very basics of continuous improvement. Question every method, routine, meeting and tool, and get rid of everything that does not serve a purpose. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve always done it this way&amp;quot; is no longer a valid excuse for holding onto old junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is equally important to rid your collective self-image of historical debris. It has taken a lot of damage from all the failed attempts. Each time a new bike has been rolled in, instead of the real problems being addressed, the subconscious conviction that you will never succeed has been strengthened. It&amp;#39;s time to stop running away from that conviction in search of better bikes. You need to process your failures and get rid of your unproductive and distorted convictions about yourself. Otherwise, you will never dare to jump on the tricycle. Your fear of failure will make you stand on the side claiming it&amp;#39;s beneath you to ride on one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you&amp;#39;re back at the starting point, your improvement journey can truly begin. To make the most of it, continuously modify your approach based on where you are in the journey. Someone who is learning to ride the bike is motivated by easy-to-reach targets and the highlighting of their progress and improved ability. A professional, on the other hand, is motivated by bigger challenges and wants the coach to visualize the improvement potential and point out the details he or she needs to correct. If you were to approach a beginner the way an experienced person wants you to, or vice versa, you would completely ruin the fun and kill the desire to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, never solely blame the bike. Always look both outward and inward. As often as you question the method, you should ask what more you need to understand about yourselves to get the results you want. When you do, you truly begin to build the people who will build your business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Fears That Prevent Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/6/99aa6420-8ad8-4b1e-94ef-6cfbe55f7472_fears.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 330px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Do you have the courage to confront your fears? If you don&amp;#39;t, they will subconsciously influence your decisions and actions. Certain fears are particularly important to acknowledge if you want to succeed with continuous improvement. These would include the fear of power loss, the fear of regret, the fear of losing face, the fear of falling behind and the fear of losing friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When these fears are prevalent, openness and creativity are replaced by watching your back and looking good. And when those motives drive you, you will never truly succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fear of Power Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you have the courage to distribute the decision-making power and ability in your organization or are you afraid your colleagues will prove to be at least as capable as you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Driven by fear of losing it, managers will hold onto power by centralizing decision-making and hoarding information. When this is the case, the majority will never be given an honest chance to contribute to continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courageous know that true power is gained by sharing knowledge, not hoarding it. Only the courageous can access the full power of their organization, because only when you let go of your fear of losing power will you be able to launch a way of working with continuous improvement where everyone is empowered to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fear of Regret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you have the courage to let go of your point of view or are you afraid that taking another perspective will make your previous choices appear less than optimal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From time to time I hear people asking, &amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t we do this earlier?&amp;quot; To me, the question has a simple answer: &amp;quot;Because you didn&amp;#39;t know then what you know now.&amp;quot; Your decision to change is in fact a sign of learning that should be celebrated and not a reason for regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When fear of regret becomes overwhelming, you will defend the perspective that makes your previous choices seem rational. Unfortunately, by defending your history, you also prevent yourself from creating a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courageous accept what is and let go of what was to create the future they desire. Only the courageous can change their perspective without fear of regret, since they know that they have done and will do the best they can in every situation. Without fear of regret, you will go from defending your own viewpoint to sharing each other&amp;#39;s perspective, and only then will you learn from each other and give yourselves optimal conditions for creating the future you truly desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fear of Losing Face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you have the courage to stop window dressing and point out the purposeless activities you see or are you afraid of being put in the naughty corner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the short tale &amp;quot;The Emperor&amp;#39;s New Clothes,&amp;quot; two weavers promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid or incompetent. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, it takes the untainted mind of a child to point out the obvious fact that the emperor is naked. When you see the kind of behavior the tale illustrates in an organization, you know that fear of losing face is in the air. When it is, you will hear a lot of talk about following routines and preparing for audits but not as much about shared purposes and customer needs. This is a sign that the original intention of things has been lost and that you have started doing them for their own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courageous know that the truth may hurt for a while but a lie hurts forever. Only the courageous dare to ask questions such as &amp;quot;Why are we measuring this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What is the purpose of this meeting?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;How does this improve our performance?&amp;quot; When you&amp;#39;re not afraid to lose face, you can stop unnecessary window-dressing activities and instead spend your energy on important improvement initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fear of Falling Behind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you have the courage to take time to reflect and try to find a smarter way or are you afraid that will make you fall behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recently, a friend only half-jokingly told me that the best way to get some time to think at his workplace was to walk quickly through their big office space. If he did, people would assume he was in a hurry to an important meeting and would not throw a pointless assignment at him. If the fear of falling behind is widespread in an organization, the main focus will be to do as much as possible as quickly as possible. What you do is secondary. In this environment, a pile of papers on your desk and a lot of unanswered emails are almost considered status symbols. They show that you have a lot to do and that people should leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courageous know that even if they win the rat race, they are still just rats. Only the courageous will be able to see that running does you no good if you are heading in the wrong direction. When you let go of your fear of falling behind, you will be able to stop focusing on short-term productivity and spend some time on the strategic initiatives you &amp;quot;never had the time to address because of all the firefighting.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s when your improvement work can become the growth strategy it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Fear of Losing Friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do you have the courage to hold your colleagues accountable or are you afraid to ruin your artificially cheerful relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In organizations where fear of losing friends is in the air, people are afraid of expecting too much of each other. Instead, they tiptoe around one another to avoid ruining the friendly but artificially blithesome atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The courageous address people&amp;#39;s desire to utilize their full potential. Only the courageous realize that true friendship is about expecting the very best of one another rather than allowing each other to be lesser versions of themselves. When you let go of your fear of losing friends, you can start helping your colleagues to utilize their full potential and their strengths. The effect will be improved results, people who grow and superficial friendships turning into deep and mutual trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fear will either stop you or strengthen you. Without the courage to confront these five fears, you will never get down to the true root cause of many of your problems. They will stay with you and forever prevent you from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that your fears, like vampires, will lose their power when they are exposed to the light. The courage to talk openly about these five fears will be rewarded with true power, satisfaction, recognition, peace of mind, rewarding relationships and, last but not least, a foundation for truly succeeding with continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Steps to Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/2/25/24ba74f0-7612-43bf-b7c2-1d11bb0087fe_continuous improvement-small.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 375px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Succeeding with continuous improvement has proven harder than expected for many organizations. One major reason is that challenges are eventually encountered where your intuitive responses actually prevent you from succeeding. To overcome these challenges, you must employ certain counter-intuitive measures, such as those listed below.ã&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common reaction to failed improvement initiatives is going for a more advanced solution. Go the other way! Simplicity will stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For your organization to succeed with continuous improvement, you must make it a natural part of the everyday work of every employee. For that to become reality, your approach can&amp;#39;t be complicated. If it is, new employees will need special training to understand your improvement method, additional support resources will be required to keep progressing, and backing it up will demand a great deal of your managers&amp;#39; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time is probably your most limited resource, and you will need to use everyone&amp;#39;s creativity. Kill two birds with one stone by keeping it simple to both save time and give everyone a chance to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common reaction to recurring problems is bombarding them with solutions. Go the other way! Focus and dig deeper to find the real cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Imagine what would happen if I took you and 10 of your colleagues to a junkyard and asked you to build whatever you wanted. The most common reaction would probably be to just stand there looking around, not sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now imagine that I asked you to build a vehicle that could transport all of you at least 10 yards without any of you touching the ground. Now your heads would probably fill with images of wheels, axles, planks to stand on and steering wheels to guide you along the way. Instantly you would become more creative and could start to organize and divide the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some people think creativity grows best when all boundaries are removed. The opposite is true. When we limit and clarify the task, it becomes easier for everyone to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same principle applies to problem-solving. When you zoom in, dig deeper, divide into smaller pieces and discard the unessential, the &amp;quot;aha&amp;quot; moment will come, and that&amp;#39;s when you find easy-to-implement solutions with great impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Visualization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common reaction to lack of initiative is pointing out problems that need to be fixed. Go the other way! First, visualize good examples and positive results to inspire action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an environment where managers constantly tell or show people in what way they are inadequate, nobody wants to be the center of attention. To draw focus away from themselves, people will start pointing out faults they see around them instead, and before you know it, you have developed a culture of blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you start by visualizing good examples and results, you will create a positive atmosphere and give people a chance to adopt a behavior worthy of praise. More importantly, when you continually highlight progress and focus on people&amp;#39;s strengths, you also create a safe environment where improvement potential can be expressed without people becoming defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common reaction in crucial situations is adopting a command and control approach. Go the other way! Ownership is a prerequisite for using one&amp;#39;s full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are told exactly what to do when it really matters, you will start to question your own ability to handle difficult situations. What&amp;#39;s worse, when you are confronted with challenges in the future, it is likely that your insecurity will prevent you from making good decisions or even acting at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a manager, it&amp;#39;s a good idea to monitor how many questions he or she asks compared with the number of statements he or she makes. What is your question/statement ratio? Do you try to be more interested or more interesting? If you double your question/statement ratio, you will both learn more and get more out of your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	A Systematic Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common reaction to a shortage of improvement ideas is launching an idea campaign. Go the other way! Only a systematic approach builds organizational improvement competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Running idea campaigns is a popular method for tapping into the creativity of an organization. There is only one problem with them. They kill creativity! If there is an unmet need in an organization, an idea campaign might create a surge of ideas &amp;mdash; a surge so big that only a fraction of all ideas can be implemented. This means the majority of people will get yet another confirmation that no one listens to their ideas, and next time they are less likely to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A systematic approach should not only make sure that improvements are made and problems are solved daily, but also increase the improvement competence of your organization every day. When you have a system like that, you will save yourself stress, time, energy and money.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Building a Culture of Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Continuous improvement is becoming increasingly important, partly because driving efficiencies is critical in today&amp;rsquo;s flat market, but mainly because of a dramatic shift in business strategy. For years, companies followed a playbook of creating and protecting one sustainable competitive advantage, and the continuous improvement efforts to support that model focused on improving existing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By contrast, today&amp;#39;s leading companies employ a much different growth strategy &amp;ndash; one that seeks to understand where customers are going, involves constant reiteration of new products and creates learning cycles. In this type of operating environment, the organizations that remain ahead of the game are those that succeed in the next generation of continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To build a culture of continuous improvement, you must develop a clearly defined statement of strategic intent for change and tie transformation outcomes to your long-term financial outlook. You can create a burning platform for change by aligning with strategic objectives (e.g., when the only way to reach your three-year aspirational goals is through your transformation, people understand the importance of your effort). Also, connect change efforts to financial outcomes and what&amp;#39;s happening at the board-level. Otherwise, you risk loud resistance and your program getting cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Focus on the Human Element&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understand the emotional journey that your colleagues have to go through to change what they do and how they do it. Employees must be able to let go of fundamental beliefs and conventions about how work should be done. In some companies, the average tenure of employees is 15 to 20 years, making the cultural aspect of change more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Build Ownership and Adoption at the Grassroots Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Engage various stakeholders in mapping out the design of the transformational journey, not just in understanding the driver for change. Modify methodologies to fit the cultural environment of your organization. Strive for commitment to change rather than compliance. When employees become committed to change, they bring their best and naturally look for ways to evolve and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Design a Strategy to Gain Buy-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be transparent with your employees. Do not call a cost-cutting initiative a &amp;quot;change initiative.&amp;quot; Change becomes extremely hard when you are asking people to be involved in cutting their jobs or their peers&amp;#39; jobs. Keep the message simple. Focus on clarity and key selling points in your communications to the business rather than discussing tools or methodologies for change. It&amp;#39;s critical that messaging resonates with the people who do the work every day; whether they sit in the C-suite, call centers or operations areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Build it first; then sell it. By design, one communication program lagged the progress by 90 days. This allowed the leader to build confidence in colleagues when communicating the plan forward, as they saw evidence of what had already been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Build a Bridge to Future-State Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Map the delta from the current management performance dashboards to the new metrics that align with your transformation. This is helpful in the education journey and allows for a smoother transition toward new metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Talent and Team Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;#39;s continuous improvement programs have changed. Look at new hiring profiles and training programs to meet those needs. Find flexible talent. For companies looking to constantly reinvent themselves, talent that can meet the changing demands of customers and markets is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;#39;s continuous improvement leaders represent a new type of engineer. They must have deep business acumen, strong C-level presence, innovation, high-energy and the ability to work well in a local environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Build a Team that Can Drive Culture Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensure your leaders can speak the business and understand colleague pain points. Some organizations place all new transformation team professionals through an immersion program where they are sent to four or five different office locations to actually do (and learn) the process. Other organizations have had success in coupling a high-performing internal leader who knows the business with an external transformation leader who knows the tools. This can help drive adoption throughout the organization (people listen when a respected peer makes the case for change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Rapid Testing and Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Roll out beta versions of change and then refine from there in order to quickly get to solutions based on the voice of the customer (this will also work well internally). Find ways to test your hypothesis quickly and then reiterate. Some companies use a &amp;quot;model office&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; a functioning branch office &amp;ndash; to test all of the latest improvements and the client interaction/response before rolling out changes globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Move away from a &amp;quot;fear of failure&amp;quot; culture. The only way to speedily generate new products, processes and models is by applauding experimentation, even when it fails. If you can begin to look at misses as learning experiences, you can shift to a very different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Technology and Customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determine where technology is a differentiator for your business and where it is not. The 1,000-person information technology department is an outdated model. Invest in the areas of technology that will help innovate core business capabilities and enhance the connection to the customer. The other functions (keeping the lights on) might be done cheaper and better externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Use technology to better understand your customers. Social media can provide a better view of customers&amp;#39; behaviors, beliefs and preferences. Insurance companies tend to limit their thinking of technology in terms of transactions, but when they link transaction and social-media data to product-development systems, they have more insights into their customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technology allows for personalization of the customer experience, which is a great area for continuous improvement. The ability to capture and process information with technology means that firms can shift from hypothesis-driven tests around two to three customer segments to a segment of thousands of unique customers with individualized needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technology also plays a role in engaging and drawing in talent. Attracting and retaining talent is a challenge for many companies. Outdated processes, systems and technology make working in the organization less appealing. Having young employees spend time with seasoned staff and management to teach them about social media and other relevant technology can provide a great way to build a more contemporary culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/umonvpBWvjk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Correctly Categorizing Waste for Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At the beginning of my career, I was trained on the shop floor as a change agent. I was part of a group of individuals selected to be coached by Toyota consultants. The organization had hired consultants to coach the team so we could disperse the philosophy, and we certainly did. We learned a great deal from the sensei, our continuous improvement manager and our plant manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We were originally introduced to three types of work: non-value-added, value-added and quasi-value-added. Value-added was the work that actually added value or something for which the customer was willing to pay. Of course, non-value-added was the waste. Then there was &amp;quot;quasi-value.&amp;quot; The more I contemplate this third category of work, the more it troubles me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have heard other organizations and consulting firms use this term. It essentially translates as work that is &amp;quot;non-value-added but necessary&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;non-value-added but under current conditions must be done.&amp;quot; I understand the definition of quasi to be &amp;quot;having a likeness to something or resembling something,&amp;quot; so this classification of quasi-value-added is perplexing. How can non-value-added activity resemble, be similar to or even comparable to value-added activity? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first reason I have to strongly disagree with the classification of quasi-value is the &amp;quot;under current conditions must be done&amp;quot; designation. For example, if an individual were to walk out to the gemba and observe a process, he is always viewing the condition in present time, in the current condition. He is certainly not observing a previous or future condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, this &amp;quot;non-value-added but under current conditions must be done&amp;quot; work would theoretically encompass every non-value-added activity in which an organization engages. Again, if an individual were to walk to the gemba, he would undoubtedly see waste. Depending on his waste-observation skills, he would more than likely identify a great deal of waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He may observe individuals walking, turning, unpacking, repacking, reworking, bending, twisting, reaching, cleaning, inspecting, etc., to complete the processes. Therefore, these activities must &amp;quot;currently be done&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;current condition.&amp;quot; All these activities have to be done until they are changed. Every one of them is just as deserving of the non-value-added classification. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Third, not only does the description of quasi-value-added make it nonsensical, but I also believe this classification can be damaging. In reality, it permits the defense of waste and ultimate acceptance of non-value work. As a continuous improvement professional, I want all waste realized and classified in the category it belongs &amp;ndash; non-value, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be considered a valuable action, the action must conform to three main criteria: the customer must be willing to pay for it, it must transform the product and it must be completed correctly the first time. If the action does not conform to all three, it is not valuable. I find this to be proper, specific and rather cut and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have been in organizations that considered some inspections &amp;quot;necessary&amp;quot; or quasi-value-added. These inspections likely were in place because of a safety concern or possibly an adjustment that needed to be verified. This does not mean the process deserved a gray-area classification such as quasi-value-added. No matter how you spin it, the action is a non-value-added task. The inspection is not transforming the product, and due to the fact it is verification, it&amp;#39;s not done correctly the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think value-added and non-value-added are black and white. The process element is either valuable or it isn&amp;#39;t. I believe classifying an action in this gray area will eventually produce an attitude of acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It would be healthier for an organization to eliminate this quasi-value-added classification. Don&amp;#39;t use a term to lessen the sting of what exists. Let it sting. Just because you cannot currently eliminate it does not mean that it should be classified in a defunct void of quasi-value-added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;#39;t let an action get lost in the muck. If it&amp;#39;s a non-valuable action, then call it non-valuable. Bring attention to it, let it be called by its unpleasant name and continue to research techniques, tools and methods to eliminate it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/8at6Z1yfSpE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Develop Employees with a Kaizen Approach</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing organizations make every effort to build the finest products available with unsurpassed quality, reliability, performance and value. This ultimately earns the customers&amp;#39; trust and strengthens their loyalty to the brand. However, these four elements (unsurpassed quality, reliability, performance and value) can run considerably deeper. They must apply to the people as much as to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often manufacturing organizations engage in kaizen (change for the better) to eliminate waste, improve procedures, maximize flow and ultimately create value for the customer. Continuous improvement organizations also continually monitor their processes through time study and observation. They improve the inputs to the process to generate the desired output. This is all noble because processes can continuously be simplified to increase value. What is often overlooked is taking this recurrent observation and kaizen approach to the development of people. After all, people are an input to the stream as much as the tools and materials they use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations should consistently invest and develop people in continuous improvement to increase their performance, reliability, quality and value. Of course, this investment would mean that the training process and the progress of each individual are recurrently observed. Granted, this requires resources, time, commitment, conviction and faith.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Edward Deming once said, &amp;quot;The most important things cannot be measured.&amp;quot; What&amp;#39;s the benefit of spending money on training and development? You will never be able to measure it. Why did you do it? Because you believe it will pay off &amp;ndash; and it most certainly will. Increasing the overall human capital will produce what many organizations dream of, a truly sustainable continuous improvement culture. Over time, this program will not need as much recurrent observation due to the fact that the investment has created an intrinsic value in people. The culture actually becomes self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once people value continuous improvement and see the use and benefit of the tools and the mindset, they want it and have the desire to help others understand it. Employees will begin to train new recruits with these values and theories as well as discuss it on the floor with their leads, engineers, managers and supervisors. They soon come to the plant to think not just to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In tandem, the organization is developing its future leaders with the foundation of continuous improvement. Eventually, there will be passionate waste eliminators and creative problem solvers at every level of the organization. The leaders will also be passionate about creating future leaders and assisting in the development of their employees and colleagues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the manufacturing organization strengthens the customers&amp;#39; loyalty to the brand by delivering quality and value to them, the organization strengthens the employees&amp;#39; loyalty to the company by delivering value to them. This value is to kaizen, train and invest in the people. Increase their knowledge, abilities and opportunities through training, coaching and &amp;quot;learning by doing.&amp;quot; This is an investment in culture and will take time and commitment. In the end, it&amp;#39;s an investment that will yield results for years to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/Wr_LkgMwrA8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Value-Added Measurement for Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations use old-school measurement to gauge their success. However, these old-school measurements can create an illusion of efficiency. This illusion only requires a bare minimum of continuous improvement activity to maintain itself. This eventually causes the company to stagnate. Sooner or later the status quo is accepted as good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These illusions are extremely hard to renounce because they are deeply rooted. They look good on paper or displayed on a wall and seem like good discussions at the daily meetings. Unfortunately, illusions are not real, and relying on them is an enormous mistake that could prove quite costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that said, how can you recognize the true current state? What can you do to understand what is really happening? How can you be sure your projects and assignments are really adding value?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are very significant questions that require answers. I believe they can all be answered by measuring the value-added percentage of the processes in your organization. How is this done? First, form a team to break down every process on the manufacturing line into elements.&amp;nbsp;Do not break it down into large chunks. It must be in finite detail. In fact, the more detail the better. This includes turns, picks, walks, alignments, searching, traveling, lifting, reaching, tightening, checking, inspecting, raising/lowering carriers, transferring material, opening boxes, opening totes and all periodical work. Basically, separate the value-added work from the non-value added work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, space does not permit me to provide a list of extremely detailed examples. However, if someone walks to pick a component, the walk cannot be included in the pick. This separation into detail takes practice, but it will get easier in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, take your elements from each station and separate them into value-added and non-value added work. Then determine the percentage of value-added work for each process on the manufacturing line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cycle Time: 220 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Value-Added Time: 50 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Value-Added Percentage: 22-percent value-added work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Continue this through all of your processes on the manufacturing line and then average your findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To further illustrate this method, consider a five-station assembly line (a sprocket assembly) with the following value-added measurements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Station 1: 22 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Station 2: 15 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Station 3: 21 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Station 4: 14 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Station 5: 19 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Total Value-Added Percentage: 18.2 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This 18.2-percent number sets the measurement for everyone. It should be posted on the shop floor for all to see. As a plant manager, you could use this data to set the annual goal to 22 percent. Everyone supporting the sprocket assembly line would then be responsible for raising the value-added percentage by 3.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be sure to make the goal achievable. You want employees to succeed and celebrate their success in order to encourage, motivate and create a good attitude for the next annual goal. By doing this, you establish a new standard that speaks to everyone and force individuals to think outside the box, challenge the status quo and truly go after waste. You also set the stage to change the culture positively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that every solution must be thought about in the value-added sense. For instance, an engineer cannot just come out to the line and add a jig to eliminate an alignment problem. A jig must only be implemented as a temporary countermeasure because it would increase the non-valuable work. Nothing should be done unless it is a justifiable temporary countermeasure or increases the value-added percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, say the current value-added percentage of the sprocket assembly line was 18.2 percent in 2013. After a switch is made to MY2014 Sprocket Assembly, the value-added percentage decreases 2 percentage points to 16.2 percent. Obviously, design did not think about assembly when developing the next model year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another example would be when a few new components are added to the assembly because the company wants more options available to the customer. While the options are not included on every model, when they are installed, the operators have to struggle and fight with the component to get it to fit. The value-added percentage goes down 1 percentage point to 17.2 percent. Once again, design did not consider how the option would negatively affect assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The value-added measurement also has extreme value in shop-floor kaizen. Individuals can use value-added percentage increases to communicate the benefits of their kaizen to management. If the value-added percentage does not increase, then either it was not the right project or perhaps the kaizen wasn&amp;rsquo;t directed properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring the value-added percentage of processes can organically improve design, flow, delivery, quality and downtime. Admittedly, it takes a little time to perfect, but it can make a positive impact throughout an organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/FiIhndL4a0g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Choose Continuous Improvement over Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Some organizations misuse lean manufacturing to overwork their people and reduce the overall headcount. Let me assure you, I am not arguing to counter the fact that reducing the headcount will save money. In the short term, it most certainly will save money. However, this savings in headcount does come at a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some managers seek headcount reduction because they associate fewer operators with increased profits. Elimination of headcount for this reason yields poor results culturally. Soon after launching a campaign such as this, operators will start noticing the intent. This will lead to a refusal to cooperate with any effort to reduce headcount and eliminate waste. The operators will begin to adamantly resist changes because they are fearful of losing their job or possibly contributing to a co-worker&amp;rsquo;s job loss. This causes stress, conflict, finger-pointing and eventually failure. It also is a surefire way to pit management against the shop floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This lack of understanding has left a bad taste in the mouths of many shop-floor employees. Likewise, it has also contributed to the conquered attitude of many managers because they have attempted this idea of &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; before and have seen it fail more than once. Understandably, this is frustrating for an organization&amp;rsquo;s leadership as well as other employees. It leads me to the opinion that the word &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; might need to be eliminated from our vocabulary for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think when leaders focus strictly on lean, they inevitably pay more attention to the dollar numbers. While the dollar numbers are important, there are other elements within an organization that far outweigh the bottom dollar. These elements create awe-inspiring flexibility and opportunity for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is my opinion that running a lean organization is actually a by-product of continuous improvement philosophies, specifically the eighth waste (the underutilization of people). When you focus your sights on lean and lean alone, you miss the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is the most important element to true organizational maturity. Continuous improvement philosophy zeroes in on culture and stimulates its development. It focuses on the people and the success of the organizational team. Its aim is to involve and engage everyone, to educate and stimulate the minds of the people. It requires everyone&amp;rsquo;s engagement, commitment and trust. It is culture-driven and will help the company grow. Everyone should be trained on its ideals and philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a continuous improvement organization to truly thrive, leadership must dedicate at least 85 percent of its efforts to the development of employees through training, influence and on-the-job training. Once the majority of the organization understands the philosophy, then and only then is it time to move to the next step. Otherwise, resistance will remain at the doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The remaining 15 percent can then be dedicated to implementing the actual tools and engaging employees. The employees who own the process need to make the change and improve the organization&amp;rsquo;s current state (with assistance from a trained continuous improvement team). Not only does this encourage them, but it also increases the chance that the change will be sustained and standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizational leaders must be careful not to put the cart before the horse. You cannot simply read or benchmark other companies and expect that you can photocopy that into your organization. You have to remember a picture is a snapshot in time. It does not tell you what happened before the picture was taken. Therefore, you cannot expect significant, highly profitable changes too fast. You cannot have the baby without going through the labor, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s get &amp;ldquo;lean&amp;rdquo; out of our heads and start communicating continuous improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s broader, includes everyone (especially the operators) and will provide long-term gains. Let&amp;rsquo;s train, empower and engage rather than cut time, rebalance and lay off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/SNoV6ajTth8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Notable Solutions Earns 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Notable Solutions Inc. (NSi) recently received a 2013 Kinetic Process Innovation Award in the data capture category for its work with Toyota Industries North America (TINA). The 17&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;annual awards program recognizes excellence and innovation in the application of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;NSi has helped Toyota Industries of North America to automate many of their manual processes, thereby eliminating many paper-based systems, streamlining operations and enabling various departments within their organization to more effectively participate in their business processes,&amp;quot; said Mike Morper, vice president of marketing at Notable Solutions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We are extremely pleased to be recognized for the work that we have done to help Toyota securely automate many of their business processes and create a more collaborative environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota selected NSi to better manage thousands of paper and electronic documents for the groups involved in the manufacturing and sales of Toyota lift trucks.&amp;nbsp;The solution included a simpler and less-paper intensive way to track shipments, manage dealer and customer invoices and simplify the import/export process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota embraced NSi&amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the delivery of both electronic and paper documents into the same business process workflows, regardless of whether the document originated at a user&amp;rsquo;s workstation or was scanned on one of the company&amp;#39;s multi-function devices (MFDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toyota is committed to the kaizen principle of continuous improvement, and NSi has given us the ability to significantly improve our business processes and a platform to easily extend the solution to other areas in the organization,&amp;quot; said Dale Colliver, TINA&amp;#39;s information technology manager. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been able to save time and money, significantly improve productivity and install more efficient procedures that are helping people make quicker and better-informed business decisions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Help Workers Get What They Need</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you are like me, you&amp;#39;ve listened to the Rolling Stones over the years. Their contemporaries, the Beatles, became more artistic and lyrical as they evolved, but for driving party music, the Stones are still hard for any band to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I even heard the words to one of their songs quoted recently: &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t always get what you want.&amp;quot; This much I already knew, but what follows has a lot of meaning in continuous improvement: &amp;quot;But if you try sometime, you might find you get what you need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So many times in problem-solving work, you do all of the analysis with the really smart, expert people and come to what you truly believe is the right answer &amp;mdash; one that you really want to work. But then you find when you implement it, &amp;quot;You know, it just didn&amp;#39;t work,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;It just didn&amp;#39;t last,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nobody would buy into it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people tend to get hung up on what they want rather than what they need. They want their elegant solution to work. They fall in love with it. For engineers, this is usually the technical solution. Having found that perfect solution, well, let&amp;#39;s not waste any time getting it in place. Forget all of that soft-skills stuff; just make people do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For some, change management is simply convincing people to do things that, for various reasons, they don&amp;#39;t seem to want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Others have talked of the frustrations and time consumed in hunting down and eliminating the wily, elusive, supposed single root cause, as opposed to just implementing some of the many solutions to various, fairly obvious contributing causes that just make things quickly better. This isn&amp;#39;t saying that structured analysis isn&amp;#39;t necessary, but rather that it&amp;#39;s not the biggest part of fixing or improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, because they tend to address fundamental issues, too many of the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; solutions become larger, which usually means expensive and time consuming. That&amp;#39;s also frustrating, as managers will usually push back at the thought of expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a problem that was aggravating and constantly frustrating plant personnel (as well as affecting productivity and quality) that could have been fixed for about $2,000. The solution had been developed with some help, but there was another, much more extensive engineering project in the works with a price tag of $80,000 that also would have taken care of that problem, among other things, so why spend the $2,000? Besides, adding in the fix on the small issue would help justify the big project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, after a number of months of management pushing back, the $80,000 project was abandoned. Sadly, the $2,000 project seemed to have been forgotten by then. Months of productivity and an opportunity to build some ownership were lost. It was their solution; they would have made it work. Instead, there was ongoing frustration at the needless waste and at being ignored. Of course, management again paid the price of being tagged with &amp;quot;too cheap to do the right thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real trick in all of this is finding the way to &amp;quot;what we need.&amp;quot; So, what is missing? What do you have to &amp;quot;try sometime?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Well, how about listening to people? How about giving them the opportunities to make changes? How about helping them rather than telling them? Amazingly, people really know a lot about what the issues are and how to deal with them if asked and given the opportunity rather than being pushed aside while the experts deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implement a process that uses communication to build ownership. This doesn&amp;#39;t just happen, and you can&amp;#39;t just do it now and again when you have some time. It takes a routine, everyday, structured process that will go on forever. Issues and improvements are identified and discussed. Actions (including communication) are decided on, along with any necessary follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The daily, small-unit shift exchange meetings can be the most powerful way to get this to happen. It also takes the involvement of supervision, maintenance personnel and even engineers to get to what you need. Although people know what they need, they usually require some help getting there and are typically receptive to genuine attempts to assist them. Engineers and managers are there to help people find their way to the right answers and, in doing that, develop to their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, the right approach is not to get people to do things that they probably don&amp;#39;t want to do, but just to help them get to what they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/7nDUfrqwcW8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Improvement Efforts Fail </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Why do improvement efforts fail or perhaps not sustain the recent gains? There are many reasons, but those most often stated are &amp;quot;lack of commitment&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;following the process.&amp;quot; But why is there lack of commitment, and why aren&amp;#39;t processes followed? Here are a few of the most common reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Too Much Focus on Tools Instead of People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analytical tools and improvement process steps are important, but people are more important. It&amp;#39;s not about &amp;quot;selling&amp;quot; them or using &amp;quot;change management&amp;quot; tools to have them accept whatever the &amp;quot;really smart&amp;quot; people have come up with. It&amp;#39;s about involving them (all of them) and having them own the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Communication Not Emphasized, Structured&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without communication, paranoia develops between work groups, shifts, departments, individuals, etc. This destroys involvement and ownership. Casual (now and again) conversations and major presentations are only a small part of what it takes. Communication must be structured and orchestrated, part of the everyday routine, and flow both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Not Knowing and Respecting What is Already in Place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every organization does some things well, and the people there have pride in their particular organization (despite what they might tell you). To ignore this is insulting and arrogant. Too many times the &amp;quot;everything here is wrong&amp;quot; attitude is evident (and sometimes outright stated) by program &amp;quot;experts.&amp;quot; Setting up &amp;quot;negative waves&amp;quot; like this never helps. Use what is in place as a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Developing the Elite vs. the Majority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improvement is an &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot; thing. It&amp;#39;s too easy to just work with the bright, energetic people and count on them to carry it all. Most people are hesitant or unwilling to accept what they haven&amp;rsquo;t had some involvement in developing or improving. Besides, this ignores a huge pool of capability. Everyone brings something to the table, but some may be unwilling to share for many reasons, such as their past ideas may have been criticized or not welcomed, there are peer-pressure issues, trust issues, etc. Sincere, routine involvement efforts can overcome these obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improvement Events vs. Routine Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While big events are good at generating interest and knocking out a lot of work in a short time, the heart and soul of sustaining improvement is getting a solid, everyday, routine process to have everyone continually dealing with the many small opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Focusing on Solving Specific Issues Rather than Developing People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s easy to get absorbed in solving specific issues and using specific problem-solving techniques instead of using the issue-solving process as a way to develop people. Of course, there will always be plenty of issues and opportunities to deal with. The scarcer commodity is the capability to deal with them. Even rarer is the ready motivation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/KTk2Q5Uqc2M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Continuous Improvement Groups Can Do More Harm than Good </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As strange as it may sound, I believe that continuous improvement (CI) culture is something that many organizations resist without realizing it. Sometimes it is not a mountain to climb but an anthill to step over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is defined as integrated knowledge, belief and behavior; a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices that characterizes an organization. If an organization lays the foundation for the employees to embrace each of these examples, it can result in harmony and progression. It can eliminate finger-pointing, develop a balanced scorecard, and produce a creative and productive working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One mistake many organizations make is the implementation of a &amp;ldquo;CI group.&amp;rdquo; This is a group of employees who explore the shop floor, seeking improvement opportunities. It is somewhat respectable when organizations implement such a group because they are making an effort toward CI, but assigning a group to kaizen full time demonstrates little confidence in lean methodologies and shows no loyalty in constructing a true CI culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These CI groups more often than not harm organizations because they assume the responsibilities of the process owner, which slows down development. They can also create inner turmoil between departments and turbulence in the improvement process. This pushes the organization further from a healthy CI culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, the improvements implemented by the CI group are not sustainable in most cases. The process owner has surrendered his or her ownership, resulting in resistance to change that he or she did not implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s comparable to someone else entering your home and rearranging your living room furniture. You might leave it that way for a day or so, but eventually you would either move everything back the way it was or rearrange it in a different way altogether. It could be because you were not fond of the arrangement or were uncomfortable with the change. What it really boils down to is that you were not part of the concept development or the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is painful for some organizations to admit the burdens of a CI group because they have devoted time and money to it. This is understandable, but as we all know, in order to fix a problem, you first have to admit that there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CI group is not a bad idea. In fact, such activities can be extremely valuable in developing a continuous improvement culture. It&amp;rsquo;s their job duties and assignments that can turn them into a harmful entity within the organization. This is where CI-driven managers have to be careful and use the group strategically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead of assigning group members to kaizen, it would be advantageous to center their efforts on lean education. The CI group members should act as consultants and use their expertise to guide improvement efforts throughout the organization. They should coach and train the shop-floor personnel as well as the process owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The owners (shop-floor personnel, leads, supervisors, engineers, etc.) should be the champions when improving their processes. A member of the CI group should be assigned to assist and guide them in the lean direction. This way, the process owner is learning lean methodologies and applying them in his or her projects. It will sanction much more sustainable changes and stimulate the owner, who will see firsthand the results that can be achieved with lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once everyone understands what CI is and how to apply it, the CI group should focus on improving the lean tools and analytical procedures. After all, the organization&amp;rsquo;s lean process should, in itself, be a lean process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The group&amp;rsquo;s input and talent should not stop there. It would also be beneficial to allow group members to assist in rewriting the organization&amp;rsquo;s policies and practices to ensure that lean permeates throughout the organization&amp;rsquo;s rules and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have a CI group at your organization, assigning these responsibilities to them will progress the organization&amp;rsquo;s continuous improvement culture and provide sustainable, positive change. It will enlighten and encourage everyone to get involved with lean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/OIN0L9LyBGs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Don't Let a Lean Vision Become Stagnant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I have been a developing change agent at my company for years now. I have saved my company a lot of money and have been promoted twice. I have had the opportunity to be trained by multiple lean consulting firms and have traveled to Japan, Mexico and California for continuous-improvement training. I consider myself pretty fortunate that my superiors saw something in me that was worth investing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that being said, I still struggle converting others to the continuous-improvement way of thinking. I know that I am not alone. I have been in frequent conversations with others who have the same issue. I think this is something that many change agents struggle with every day. It is frustrating and somewhat discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I personally have seen supervisors and managers squirm when I attempt to have standard work and process management discussions. I have seen leaders dig to uncover reasons not to move forward because it is easier to stay the same. If the amount of effort were put into evolving instead of maintaining the current state, most organizations would be exceptional ones. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to maintain an outspoken passion for lean when everyone around you seems to loathe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, some of the lean transformation elements must be implemented by management, and it still boils down to what measurements are put into place. However, I truly believe that there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such resistance to lean culture and system changes if the viewpoint was slightly altered. I have come to realize that sometimes concepts that have been discussed for months with little success can be presented in a slightly different style and be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s similar to Coke and Pepsi changing their logos. They change every couple of years to keep their products fresh and interesting for the consumer. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to me that the slight change in the packaging generates huge sales. This is a good strategy for lean change agents as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean advocates have to keep their product fresh and interesting. As advocates, we must develop new ways to illustrate the concept and display the benefits. Show others how lean will streamline their processes and ultimately make the job more rewarding and easier. We need to keep the vision dynamic and interesting; we can&amp;rsquo;t let the vision become stagnant. Sometimes the sheer passion, conviction and creativity that we display in tandem with sleek &amp;ldquo;packaging&amp;rdquo; can encourage others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop new ideas as frequently as you can. Present them to management, supervisors and even shop floor personnel with conviction and excitement. Give multiple examples that can be understood by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be your organization&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;lean street preacher.&amp;quot; Make powerful slide shows or flip charts filled with information. Explain all of the benefits and savings. Make it painfully hard to say no. Unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it, no will still be a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; is what frequently gets the advocates disheartened. It gets incredibly tiring when you are attempting to construct a prospering lean company and no one wants to focus or do their part. It is frustrating when you are speaking in a language few in the organization understand. It can be exhausting to develop processes that return to the original wasteful state after a week of success. Without a doubt, these examples beat the advocate down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, we must continue to broadcast that a continuous improvement culture and lean systems will help our organizations prosper. Even if we are considered the outcasts for a while, it will be a great reward when the light switch is turned on. So hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/it_fk9wV8h4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Executing a Continuous Improvement Plan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Every plan for continuous improvement should follow a path based on performance metrics for quality, cost, delivery and safety. For each of these groups, you should have well-defined targets such as to improve by 10 percent, reduce by 12 percent, increase by 9 percent, etc. For each metric, you should have a corresponding objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, you should have communicated the plan and the reasons why you are going after certain items on the plan. It is now time to execute. Each of the items on your plan may need some additional analysis to see exactly what is involved in the improvement of those items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Are you going to have a team leader by initiative? Are you going to employ value-stream management? Are there natural families for you to follow? Is your continuous improvement effort themed in one area (quality, cost, delivery, safety, morale and/or innovation)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you go through the next levels, you are moving from strategic questions to more tactical questions. At the high level, you may want to improve delivery performance by 11 percent. However, before you can attack delivery performance, you need to do some analysis of what goes into the delivery performance. This may include questions about volume, customer mix, new products, standard vs. special systems, days of the week, geography, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My recommendation is that you employ lean and Six Sigma to these next steps so that you are able to effectively sort out which is which. Please be careful that you don&amp;rsquo;t just do what you have always done. In other words, if your organization is slanted toward Six Sigma, don&amp;rsquo;t make everything a define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) project. On the other hand, if your organization is more of a lean organization, don&amp;rsquo;t call everything a kaizen either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you are laying out the next steps of your executable plan, you must first decide which approach to use. Not everything is a kaizen; not everything is a project. Selecting the right tool will ensure you the highest impact at the lowest cost in terms of time required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For purposes of simple definitions, consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Kaizen &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This is a very rapid approach to continuous improvement. The scope should be such that while you have a problem statement identified, you do not yet have the solutions. Be careful that you are not trying to &amp;ldquo;boil the ocean&amp;rdquo; in a week. You are willing to empower a team to execute the improvement process. There are specific and measureable goals and objectives for the problem statement. During a kaizen week, there should be a miniature plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle within the week. You also have a resource who is well-versed and capable of leading a kaizen for you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Project &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This is a more long-term approach that may allow for items to be scoped on a larger scale. These may include projects that are bigger than a kaizen. In some cases, projects may be made up of several kaizens. There are specific and measureable goals that you are after. You are willing and able to empower a team to pursue the effort. You have a resource available who is capable of managing a project and has enough continuous improvement experience to bring the expertise to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Do-It &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; These are items in which you know what needs to be done, but the resources just haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been allocated to the effort. For example, in looking at the plan, replacing the spindle bearing on a piece of equipment shows up as a reason you can&amp;rsquo;t perform. Replacing the spindle becomes a &amp;ldquo;do-it.&amp;rdquo; Now, just &amp;ldquo;do it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of each of these activities, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to update your posting(s) and communicate the activities to others. You also need to chart and track the results to make sure that your efforts are yielding the results you seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, what you want is a culture of continuous improvement. Along the way, you will reap a great deal of benefits in terms of performance improvements and tactical performance. The end game is always the culture. Never lose sight of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/5JWQMDLYTdU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Partnering for Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A major U.S. manufacturer of fabricated steel and metal products was experiencing a troubling and ongoing series of bearing failures on a dual line used for coating operations. A critical bearing located on the outboard roll of the dual line&amp;rsquo;s cleaning section would fail, necessitating repeated replacement. This occurred six times over the short period of four months, resulting in unscheduled downtime (to replace a failed bearing time after time) and lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The bearing was the subject of frequent monitoring, with vibration analysis showing no readily detectable problems (all spectra appeared good). Nevertheless, it was only a matter of weeks before the latest replacement bearing took its turn for the worse and for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Determining the root cause of the problem and arriving at a solution ultimately resulted from a unique three-way relationship between the steel manufacturer, on-site reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists (a team of highly trained engineers specializing in specific industries). Both the reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists, working hand in hand, had already become invaluable on-site resources for the operation, serving as intrinsic members of the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s maintenance staff &amp;ndash; regularly attending maintenance planning and scheduling meetings, convening with the customer&amp;rsquo;s reliability manager, and contributing input and suggestions along the way regarding optimized machinery health throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In this case, reliability engineers tagged the &amp;ldquo;bad actor&amp;rdquo; (failed bearing), and the industry specialists performed in-depth detective work into the root cause of failure. The conclusion was that the bearing was failing due to the roll&amp;rsquo;s thrusting in an axial direction, which the particular type of bearing could not accommodate. After documenting that the installed bearing could be suitably replaced by a more appropriate toroidal roller bearing that was specially designed to handle axial displacement without inducing additional axial forces of friction, a switch was made. In addition, a more suitable lubrication recommendation was adopted. The line has been running smoothly ever since without a bearing failure or process interruption. Value added over mean time between repairs (MTBR) to this steel producer was more than $230,000 in the first year, with cash flow breaking even in one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	While this represents an example of how various bearing technologies can solve particular operational challenges, the compelling story runs much deeper and is illustrative of a trend that is gradually shifting the reliability landscape into a new territory &amp;ndash; light years ahead of the conventional (and reactive) practice of engaging maintenance expertise only after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This case especially demonstrates how an operation can elevate reliability partnerships to an entirely new level by teaming with reliability and engineering professionals who become integral members of an organization&amp;rsquo;s maintenance framework. The on-the-scene professionals serve as focused sets of &amp;ldquo;eyes and ears&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; supported by an array of relevant resources and expertise &amp;ndash; to identify and diagnose machinery health problems, propose incisive recommendations to solve them, document all findings in writing, tally anticipated savings and efficiencies to substantiate the efforts, and make necessary fixes just in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This innovative approach (and advanced alternative) to traditional predictive maintenance practices effectively re-casts &amp;ldquo;supporting&amp;rdquo; players into the role of highly involved team players dedicated to the success of an operation&amp;rsquo;s initiatives for continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Creating Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Advantages of this approach can extend well beyond the basic capability to make immediate, timely and long-term fixes to machinery assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	First and foremost, while partnerships between operations and expert resources have always been recognized as critical to the success of reliability programs, the inclusion and participation of experts as actively involved members of an existing maintenance team can help to dramatically improve communications, advance relationships and knowledge, and result in newfound improvements in the health of assets across the board. Committed and sustained partnerships among all players will contribute significantly to the success of any reliability program and create value along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Among value-created opportunities, this approach opens the door to readily available root-cause analysis &amp;ndash; digging as deeply as necessary into machinery health problems to identify the true culprit(s) and take the appropriate remedial action(s). This practice goes well beyond those employed during typical predictive maintenance activities and can help prevent problems from recurring and taking productivity down with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Such improvement initiative programs can further benefit operations by introducing a training element for maintenance staff to equip them with insights into relevant procedures and technologies to help lower the total cost of operations and to recognize &amp;ndash; and remedy &amp;ndash; a problem when they detect one. Routine maintenance procedures can be improved, too, as maintenance education and awareness expand and new technologies are put into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	For example, a U.S. taconite mining operation has partnered with a dedicated team of reliability engineers and locally based industry specialists with powerful results. The engineers conduct weekly predictive maintenance &amp;ldquo;routes&amp;rdquo; throughout the operation, provide reports advising machine conditions and recommended actions, and recover or preserve failed components (such as bearings) accompanied with a detailed history of the failure(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In turn the industry specialists, who are well versed in the mining field, perform damage analysis, report and document the root cause, and recommend improvements designed to eliminate repetitive failures. The specialists additionally provide on-site training associated with bearing and seal installations, as well as support during installations &amp;ndash; all of which are highly valued by the mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Specific project successes at this site included the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Root-cause failure analysis showed that conveyor pulley bearing failures were being caused by the ingress of contaminants and were resolved with an improved sealing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Mill pinion bearing failures were linked after analysis to poor support for the bearing and ingress of contaminants, and were remedied with a recommended improvement to the bearing housing fit, custom sealing system solution, and pinion rebuild and replacement overseen by the industry specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Dust-collector fans suffered from poor installation practices, and training was subsequently provided to demonstrate the proper use of a hydraulic assist for installation (consisting of a hydraulic nut, hydraulic pump and dial indicator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Making the Grade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	While this real-world demonstration of teamwork can help reap measurable rewards from improved asset reliability, increased machinery uptime and enhanced productivity, such initiatives will be highly dependent on the level of expertise and the extent of a reliability partner&amp;rsquo;s experience, capabilities, and supporting resources and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Among the questions to ask when beginning the selection process for a reliability team to help realize optimized results consistent with a viable continuous improvement initiative include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;bull; &lt;/em&gt;Can knowledge and experience specific to your industry be demonstrated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Are the provider&amp;rsquo;s supporting resources (from technologies and services to analysis and training) sufficiently extensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Does the provider understand how reliability influences the life-cycle management of assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the team respond quickly when machinery problems unexpectedly occur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the team seamlessly blend with the existing maintenance function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will written documentation on problems and recommended solutions be part of the package?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will the provider be suitably equipped to support equipment fixes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Can the provider demonstrate a close relationship with distributor sources to supply solutions in a timely manner when required?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will program progress be measured in a meaningful way? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&amp;bull; Will total cost of operations be demonstrably reduced over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The answers to these (and related) questions can help guide decision-making when selecting a reliability partner best equipped to sustain a continuous improvement initiative and accrue both immediate and long-term benefits for any operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An Effective Way to Drive Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I think of planning, I always remember a quote that is attributed to Abraham Lincoln. &amp;quot;Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening my axe.&amp;quot; The point is that if you spend adequate time preparing to do the job, the job itself will go much smoother/better/faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a process for driving improvement and alignment called the PDCA cycle. PDCA stands for plan, do, check and act. It is a great approach to any business challenge. In very simple terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What do we want to do?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What do our customers want us to do?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Why is it important?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the steps we are going to use to actually move it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What process will be needed? (Hint: Lean Six Sigma).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate that the plan exists and why it is important.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make the plan visual using graphs, charts and scoreboards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Explain what the organization needs to do to be successful and clearly define what success &amp;ldquo;looks like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Execute the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Chart where the progress is vs. where we want it to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate that the plan is yielding the results you intended.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide team updates and progress reports.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Include this on all monthly and quarterly reports.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate and post the results to date on the visual boards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Celebrate and communicate success as you find it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hold people accountable for the progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Refocus on areas where progress is not up to par.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Adjust the plan if the success isn&amp;rsquo;t in line.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Add or take away from the plans if/when the business needs change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Throughout the year, there should be information moving through the organization from senior management to the shop floor and vice versa. As business needs change, some of the metrics and measures might also need to change. As the improvements are made, the results need to be included in the information being shared. This creates a very clear and reliable source of alignment to again reinforce the need to keep all resources pointed in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few summarizing thoughts about using PDCA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This clarity of purpose will drive the organization to improve those key metrics that are most important to the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The alignment of the effort drives synergy, teamwork and ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The communication helps break down walls and focus the organization on the right parts of the business.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The combination of these items will most certainly yield high-impact results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/oHoXwZ3k5cM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>A Tactical Approach for Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When planning your continuous improvement (CI) efforts, you must first determine what it is that you are going to improve. There are always thousands of things you need to do but only enough resources to really go after a few of them. So which ones do you go after? Which ones will impact your business the most? Which ones will impact the customers the most? Which ones will help you be more profitable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My recommendation is to start with your customers. There are several ways of obtaining input from the customer. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into how to collect information in this article, as that would be fodder for a whole different series of articles. However, if you don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a mechanism, try this approach: Pick three to seven of your biggest and most influential customers and call them or invite them to visit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ask them these questions or other questions like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How can we serve you better?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What do we do in our process/product that causes you issues, challenges and problems?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What would make us your No. 1 preferred vendor of choice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be prepared for price and cost to come up and be a part of the discussion. You will have to choose how to respond to this question, and you and your team need to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, talk with some of the internal managers and leadership. Check with accounting to see if there are things on which you should focus. Sometimes the trends can hide the details. Maybe there is an uptick in one area but a downward trend in another area. In this case the bottom line doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much, so you probably should look into what is driving the numbers up and down. Other places to look include vendors and purchasing, quality, distribution and warehousing, and sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, talk with internal team members, informal leaders and managers. There is a wealth of information in every organization if you only take time to ask the questions and listen to the answers. Ask the internal members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What issues do they struggle with?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What makes their jobs hard?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What should you improve?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What would make them happier to come to work?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How could you make their particular process more efficient?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopefully, you get the idea that you need to sort through and seek out input from several perspectives. The more places you look, the more comprehensive (and meaningful) the list will be. Remember, the driving force behind this is to develop a three-, six-, nine- or 12-month CI plan. Maybe this is an annual planning session to develop the Lean Six Sigma plan for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The point is that you are developing your plan for improving the business in several key areas. This is a serious effort that will to some degree determine where you will spend your time, effort and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that you have a plan, or at least a framework for the plan, you must line up the resources necessary to drive that plan and ensure that you will be successful. You need to get the right people around the table to ensure that you have buy-in and that the leadership team is going to support the plan with resources, support, time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopefully, since you have asked them what it is that they want you to accomplish, you have developed a plan that these folks will support. This is called alignment. Alignment means that the team in a company, division or plant agrees to support the plan and the initiatives, both tactically speaking and strategically. If you have been diligent in reaching out to people and ensuring that their thoughts, ideas and issues are represented, you should have fantastic alignment. If not, you probably have a plan with very little support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you are talking with different factions of the organization, you should be looking for overlap or multiple people talking about the same issue. In other words, you may hear the same issue from several different perspectives. For example, you might overhear the accountant talking about how much inventory is being carried and the manufacturing manager talking about running out of space. This is probably the same problem from two different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution(s) to this problem will most likely solve two problems, but it will also be a large problem to tackle. The places where you have the most overlap are where you will have the most alignment and the largest potential for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, realize that while you hear about a problem, you will have to study and understand the baseline of the situation. Where do you stand now? What is the situation at present day, and what has the trend done over the trailing 12 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have the plan and the people sitting around the table talking about the plan, look around the room and ask them: &amp;ldquo;Will you support this plan and help drive the success of this effort?&amp;rdquo; Until you get a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; from each stakeholder, the meeting isn&amp;rsquo;t done and you are still in the planning phase of the plan, do, check, act (PDCA) cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, you must have a comprehensive plan for your CI effort. Reach out to stakeholders (both internal and external to the organization) to gain buy-in, alignment and ownership. Articulate what it is you are trying to accomplish in SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely) terms. You then will have specific targets that should yield significant impact to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hopefully, you have some high-level goals and objectives, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce overall cost by 7 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve output by 9 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce lead time by 14 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce lost-time accidents by 7 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve quality (measured by first-pass yield) by 9 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve on-time delivery to John&amp;rsquo;s House of Widgets by 11 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce inventory on-hand by 10 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce cost of manufacture by 4.5 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next question is how are you going to implement the plan? What should you do next? Where do you start? The first step is to see where you are currently. You may have heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;baseline.&amp;rdquo; Where are you today specifically with the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, you are going to enter into the &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; phase of the PDCA cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some potential places to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Value stream map&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Road map&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scorecard (if the data is the same as the goals and objectives)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lean audit (think in terms of the principles of lean that Dr. James Womack outlined in his books)
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Value&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Value stream&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Flow&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Pull&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Culture&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This last one may be hard to put together in the short term. If you choose that route, ask around to see if you can find a lean audit that you can use without creating one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/7jFuJPxAoRE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicate to Build World-Class Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is the real objective of Lean Six Sigma? When I ask this question, I usually get responses such as increased quality, improved speed, reduced cost, reduced errors and many other tactical improvement measures. Those are all benefits to continuous improvement (CI). The real goal of CI is to build a culture or improve a culture. As Dr. Womack wrote in &lt;em&gt;Lean Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, the fifth principle of lean is culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does it mean to build a culture or to enhance the culture? How does a world-class culture behave? A world-class culture has an engrained tendency to seek out, identify and drive improvements at all levels of the organization. It moves from a culture where lean and Six Sigma are something to be done (like a project) to a place where Lean Six Sigma is simply the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you are engaging your CI plan, ask yourself what your culture is like. Are you doing CI or is CI simply the way things are done? This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to figure out, so don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time dwelling on it. Either you are or you aren&amp;#39;t. Either answer is OK. Just recognize where you are and where you are trying to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of the equation in building a world-class culture is to engage people at all levels of the organization. Leaders must tie everyone into the plan for the CI process. They must get people involved, ask them for help and support them through the change. In short, leaders must lead them through the process. Communication is the first step to doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have developed your CI plan for the division, plant or department, tell people about it. Share it with those around you and those who work in the processes that will be affected. Tell them what you (with their help) are going to do. In so doing, you are absolutely obligated to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them why you have this plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them what is in it for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can&amp;rsquo;t stress these two items enough. If you are going to build a culture and truly reach where you are trying to go, you must get everyone involved and singing from the same sheet of music. You must get them onboard with the plan if they are going to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many management teams still employ demand and direct tactics. They use pressure to get things done. While this can be effective, it usually does little to engage the culture or endear the personnel to the organization. Engage and empower your team members if you want to accelerate the velocity of the CI plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another part of the communication process is to post the information on the wall, on the shop floor and wherever you have a facility board. Put the plan, targets, progress and results together in one place. As you can, have communications at that place and talk about it. People want to know how they are doing, what is coming up next and how they are involved. People want to hear about results and plans. They want leaders to point out when things are going well and when things need to be improved or changed. People want to know where they stand. It is the leaders&amp;rsquo; job to have open and honest communications with them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you communicate and post the plan, you are almost ready to start executing. Before you do, however, you also need to make sure that all of this work doesn&amp;rsquo;t become &amp;quot;window dressing.&amp;quot; How are you going to communicate going forward? How are you going to share the wins, challenges and opportunities going forward? How are you going to hold yourself and your team accountable? What are you going to do to keep people fully engaged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not going to tell you the answer, but I will offer some very strong advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I once heard about cowboy leadership principles, &amp;quot;If you are leading a herd of cattle, take a look around every once in a while and make sure they are still following you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/2VEx_5YhIFo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Create, Implement Improvements Daily</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I heard a radio interview some time back with Neil Sedaka. If the name is no longer familiar, he is probably one of the most successful songwriters of all time. His songs (more than 1,000 of them) are performed by many different and famous artists. How does he write? Every morning he gets up, has breakfast, sits down at the piano, and just writes and rewrites music all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shelby Foote is probably the most widely read historian of the U.S. Civil War. Every single day, he got up in the morning and wrote 600 words, and he wrote them long hand with a nib pen and inkwell. He found that speed worked best for his flow of thought. If for some reason he missed a few days, he found it very difficult to get back to his 600-word pace, so he seldom missed a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling, he didn&amp;#39;t just whip it out in a few months. He spent four years, just about every single day, lying on his back on scaffolding, dripping paint on his face, painting and repainting, and then repainting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Samuel Taylor Coleridge supposedly told that he wrote of the fabulous images in the poem Kubla Khan immediately on waking from a drug-induced dream, when actually it was rewritten as many as 14 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it is with improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generating and implementing improvements is just plain everyday work by everyone. We have a vision of creativity &amp;mdash; sudden revelation, inspiration out of the blue, ideas by gifted individuals &amp;ndash; but if we wait for this kind of process to generate improvements, there won&amp;#39;t be many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s like counting on the probability percentage of being struck by lightning. It&amp;#39;s not high (unless you are a golfer). However, the probability of being struck by lightning is higher than the probability of winning a state lottery, even if you do buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every single day or shift, as issues develop and are dealt with, the discussion and analysis of these issues should generate improvements. The synergy of the properly conducted daily shift overlap meeting will continuously generate improvement ideas, and more importantly, provide the involvement and ownership that actually gets these ideas successfully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improvement may not completely resolve the issue, but if it makes a contribution, that&amp;rsquo;s just fine. The next one will take it further. Many improvements simply have to do with generating communication and training material. The material doesn&amp;#39;t have to be perfect to be shared. The key thing is that it&amp;#39;s shared quickly while the issue is current. This enables other ideas to be built on it, which will lead to even more improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We do tend to fixate on equipment and material modification and upgrades when looking for improvements, but the majority of opportunities and the easiest to implement are about how people do work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/EAXagDMblHI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Develop a Plan to Reach Continuous Improvement Goals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/9/6/f10c6a0b-9e80-4bab-a7e7-67d887226a7a_plan-do-check-act.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 199px; float: left;" /&gt;In the ever-changing world of continuous improvement, we must always remember to walk our own walk. If we, as continuous improvement leaders, are teaching and coaching people in the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) process, we too must ensure that we are leading by example. We must not vary our process from this cycle of improvement that works so very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many companies get so focused on the DCA part of the equation that planning is completely left out or is at best an afterthought. We do, check, act, do, check, act over and over again so many times that we are working really hard in several different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, I challenge you to be very deliberate in your planning process. Since I am focused on continuous improvement, I am writing this note from that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What exactly do you want to accomplish through the application of continuous improvement? While that is a pretty broad subject, consider each of the following topics: quality, cost, delivery, safety, morale and growth. Thinking as specific as you can, lay out quantifiable goals for each of these topics so that the organization has a clear signpost to follow, as well as a quantifiable progress report for the fiscal year you are confronting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of this is clear if you go through an enterprise-level value stream map. If that is not the model you follow, at least spend time with the continuous improvement process to define where you are trying to take the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have determined your high-level goals for each of these topics, then you can set out with the tactical plan for how to accomplish those goals using Pareto analysis, value stream maps and other tools. The point is to define where you want to go before you embark on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As someone once told me, &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t know where you are trying to go, the best map in the world won&amp;#39;t help you much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/B3GYBMq3ClU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicate for Successful Transitions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/8/15/ce7bcea2-aab7-4a33-8ad2-fca0d65a812d_communicate for transitions.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;A few years ago, I came to the realization that I needed to improve my engagement with team members and colleagues. One of the things I decided to change was to push myself deeper into the details of the multitude of ongoing projects. I realized there was so much going on that I was having trouble providing enough attention to the details involved in each project. I was only brought in and sought after if there was a problem or a tough decision needed to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As this little epiphany came into light, I realized that this was not good for me or my team members. So, I set about making it one of my priorities to work on from that point forward (in the name of my own continuous improvement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, it also occurred to me at the same time that a change of my level of attention could cause the organization to take a step back and feel a little nervous about what I was doing and why I was doing it. As I pondered this notion, I decided to seek out some advice. I reached out to one of my mentors and explained to him the dilemma that I was facing and asked for his counsel in how I should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His first question was, &amp;ldquo;How do you think your people will feel about this change?&amp;rdquo; As I explained that I thought they might feel a little unnerved or concerned about why I was changing this approach, he nodded in understanding. He asked me a few more questions, and we briefly discussed the problem. Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Beau, how would you feel if your boss changed his behavior like this?&amp;rdquo; I explained that I think I would feel much like my people are going to feel about it. He agreed, and then asked me what would make me feel better about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The light bulb that went off in my head was blinding. I needed to communicate to my team members what I was going to do, what it meant and why I was going to do it. The answer was there, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t see it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, I prepared myself for a team meeting to share with them my plans, my reasoning and what it meant for them. The meeting went great, the people were receptive and they were then eager to share with me the details I was seeking. As this change progressed, I became better at coaching, and the open and honest dialogue helped them feel at ease, maybe even a little excited about it. It went better than I had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My learning from this process was two-fold. First, it really helped to talk with someone about the problem I was facing in order to seek input and advice. If you have someone to turn to whom you respect, seek him or her out to compare notes and do it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, if you are changing the way you do something, explain it before you change it. The open dialogue will get your colleagues on your side and allow them to help you make a successful transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/IRxb1ngWOoQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Continue Your Education to See Continuous Improvement</title>

	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/8/9/bf0042a8-85c4-4b9f-831d-e573c34798e8_continue education.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left;" /&gt;On my first day in my first job out of college, I discovered technical and business magazines in the bathroom stalls. My supervisor also informed me that I was expected to continue my education while at my desk by boning up on the latest engineering articles and tracking new products. I found out that all of the plant engineering department employees did this within an 8-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company was sending a powerful message that learning was continuous and the company had a responsibility to the employees to help them grow. I found that employees were taking college courses in a variety of disciplines including business, art, history, religion and marketing. The company believed that any expansion of the employees&amp;rsquo; horizons made a better person and, hence, a better employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since that job years ago, I have carried that philosophy throughout my career. Life is the career, and work is only a portion of it. If we are to have balance in our life careers, all parts must grow if one part grows, but how does that carry over to the workplace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies encourage continuing education with courses that are job-related. Would a course in Eastern religion be job-related? Think about the diverse workforce. How about a course in pottery making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I had an employee who was a workaholic and did not know how to relax nor did he have a hobby. He asked if the company would allow him time off each week to attend a pottery class and would I pay for it. The answer was yes, and he found that he had a talent for &amp;ldquo;throwing bowls.&amp;rdquo; He came to work a bit different &amp;mdash; more relaxed and less stressed. He had a hobby. Fellow employees and clients found a different, worldlier person who began and quit the work day with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the first exposure to magazines in the stall through a company-paid master&amp;rsquo;s degree and multitudes of growth experiences, I have come to believe that not only must our horizons be expanded, but we must focus on growing the individual, with the faith that out of that effort will come a different employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/Ks87MyQ9oNY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>10 Keys for an Effective Lean Operation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my opinion and experience, there are 10 components or keys for an effective lean operation. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1)&amp;nbsp;Safety is not a slogan. It is acted upon and driven similar to quality and other key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2)&amp;nbsp;Productivity is improving 10 percent or more per year, quality metrics are improving at 25 percent or more per year, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measurements are utilized for continuous line improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3)&amp;nbsp;Visual controls are in place to help measure managing daily improvement (MDI). These would include things such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quality cost delivery and service (QCDS) boards are in place and acted on daily.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Associates meet every day to review the previous day and current day.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Statistical process control (SPC) tracking is in place on key processes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Andon lights and abnormality response systems are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4)&amp;nbsp;Housekeeping is continuously improving, making sure there is a place for everything and ensuring everything is in its place with no useless clutter. Shadow boards are being used, and lines are painted on the floor for safety and as a prerequisite for standard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5)&amp;nbsp;Kaizen methodologies, the process of continuous process improvements, are linked to strategic objectives. Kaizen events are executed monthly to drive performance. Associates are involved and challenged. Resources are dedicated, and the company is utilizing a strong continuous improvement office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6)&amp;nbsp;Raw and in-process inventories, which are the amount of materials the plant needs for orders within five days, are moving toward a build-to-order focus. In short, you are building only what you need to fill daily orders. Create the flexibility to create any product, any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	7)&amp;nbsp;Production schedule compliance, which is meeting the production schedule as planned, is at 95 percent or greater, and the customer service index (CSI), which measures if orders are complete and on time, is at 90 percent or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8)&amp;nbsp;Associates are provided at least 20 hours or more per year of off-the-floor or classroom training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9)&amp;nbsp;A production process is established for daily, weekly and monthly accountability. For example, this would include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Daily meetings to review the schedule, quality, cost and inventory&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Weekly financial accountability meetings&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Monthly scorecard reviews&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;Quarterly reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10)&amp;nbsp;The plant is always moving toward the next record in safety, productivity, quality and inventory levels. Associates are excited about creating a positive environment where people hold themselves accountable.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Win with Training or Lose Without It </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does training within industry (TWI) have to do with the current economic issues? Well, it can have a very positive impact for firms struggling with the present business conditions. Whether times are prosperous or not, any business can benefit from improving output per employee, resolving people issues quicker and more effectively, drastically trimming the time to train personnel (whether they are a new hire or long-time employee), and improving safety and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So why isn&amp;rsquo;t every business leveraging TWI to reap these benefits? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but they should. TWI is also a foundation for standard work and continuous improvement; that is, it is a foundation for the lean business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The United States dropped the ball after World War II by letting TWI go the way of the buggy whip or steam engine. Many Japanese firms picked up that ball and ran with it &amp;mdash; and are still running with it today. Toyota runs with it today. In fact, that company could not be as competitive without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TWI is not just for manufacturing. It is every bit as applicable in the healthcare and service industries. It was developed by industry for industry (and service), so industry would be crazy not to use and leverage it once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past couple of years, a growing number of firms have begun to use TWI again, and the ones who are working with it seriously are garnering significant benefits. When combined with a valid business strategy, it can put a business in a position to be very prosperous when times are good, and to be stable and OK when times get tight. Where would you like your firm to be &amp;mdash; with the winners or the losers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps if TWI had never been dropped manufacturing, especially automotive, would not be in the mess it is in today. It played a significant role in saving the country once. Can it do it again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/juG6GzkdzLs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Gain a Competitive Advantage in a Tough Economy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With the current economic environment, there is always the tendency to hunker down and try to ride the storm out, but is that the best strategy? Probably not. While there is most certainly a need to watch budgets closely &amp;mdash; even very closely &amp;mdash; and tighten up on extra activity, now is the time to take advantage of developing your current employees to help improve your operation and, in fact, all business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A growing number of companies have been actively implementing and even working to accelerate training within industry (TWI) into their everyday business practices and operations. The program is designed to enable improvements every day by everyone, create a more functional relationship between employees and their supervisor (which is translated into solving issues before they become a problem), and getting workers properly trained in record time. To summarize: Save money, leverage and enhance tribal knowledge, and make the entire business enterprise more competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TWI has a long history of success in this area. It also continues to have success with firms today. In the Midwest location where I live, a growing number of companies are effectively using TWI to meet this need. It is giving them a competitive advantage during this critical economic slowdown. These same firms are steadfast in their belief that deploying TWI skills will put them at a significant advantage when the economy picks up. They plan to be well ahead of the game, and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is typical that the businesses that did not just hunker down but put into action a plan to develop and improve themselves are the firms that not only survive through difficult periods but thrive when better times return. Many organizations are doing this right now, and my guess is that they will be reaping the rewards in the months ahead as business improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/yu-0VhCjFCA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicate to Change Your Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In many of the articles and books that are published today, you see a great amount of improvements in different industries and companies using different methodologies and tools. Many times, it seems that if you use the same tools or methods, you should get the same results. This is not always the case. There is an underlying story to a company that excels in making improvements, and that is the culture. I like to think of the culture as the foundation to effective operation. Culture includes leadership, initiative, teamwork and all of the other nice words we love to throw out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Webster&amp;rsquo;s defines culture as &amp;ldquo;All the knowledge and values shared by a society.&amp;rdquo; I think the interesting part of this definition is the word &amp;ldquo;shared.&amp;rdquo; Have you ever been in an environment where everyone seems anxious to pitch in and volunteer to help others accomplish projects? In these instances, everyone has a shared sense of purpose. Each one of them probably knows how important the others and their work are to the overall goal of the organization. This is a powerful motivator, especially when you understand that the success of the organization relies on everyone. That is also why organizations that are not doing very well normally have a very compartmentalized culture in which individuals think that others are &amp;ldquo;not important and should go away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not going to give you some five-step process that will change your culture. What I will give you is a simple piece of advice, and that is to start communicating &amp;hellip; always. What I am saying is to communicate with everybody you deal with and find out what drives them to do what they do. Shared goals and attitudes are not just sent down from above but are also influenced by the bottom or true foundation of the organization. Remember that the deck-plate workers are the value-adding group for the company and should be a driving force to set the culture and communication. The management and executives should be the facilitators of the communication process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You will find that programs and projects will start to run more efficiently, and the atmosphere will change. Keep in mind that this is not an overnight change. It will require time and hard work. Take a bite of humble pie and start talking to those around you to find out what their purpose is and where their beliefs are leading them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/6FA9V0ch1Ro" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Follow-up is Key for Greater Efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are using their computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) as a record-keeping tool. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they want, a spreadsheet perhaps can suffice. A correctly used CMMS is a tool that goes way beyond record-keeping. By not fully utilizing the CMMS, maintenance operations are missing out on opportunities to save time and money. As the utilization of CMMS increases, overall productivity and profitability also increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure you know the full functionality of your CMMS and plan ways to improve your use of it in the future. A CMMS gives you the ability to look at a massive amount of data that can be tracked over time, enabling you to make meaningful decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Full utilization of the CMMS begins with the process flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Ideal Process Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are eight components of a good maintenance work process flow: notification, approval, planning, scheduling, dispatching, executing, follow-up and performance matrix. In my experience over the last 20 years, I always see three out of these eight key components. These are notification, dispatching and executing of work. Beyond that, however, the other five may not be in place at all or only in a limited form &amp;mdash; for example, planning and scheduling. However, two categories that are consistently absent are follow-up and performance matrix, even in some of the most modern maintenance environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Follow-up/Continuous Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A large part of follow-up involves reviewing and interpreting CMMS reports and completed work orders. Someone, most likely a planner or a supervisor, should review these items on a regular basis. Whether it is daily or weekly, these reports need to be consistently monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some examples of follow-up items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Root Cause: &lt;/strong&gt;By monitoring completed work orders, you may find that there is a repeated failure on a piece of equipment. This alerts you to the fact that there is a larger problem with the device. Maintenance workers are mostly working under stressful conditions, and they are almost always rushed. They often don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to properly diagnose the problem. Instead, they perform a quick-fix, and the problem will eventually occur again. If you are performing consistent follow-up, however, you can catch this and allow more time to fix the problem completely. This saves time in the long run as you aren&amp;rsquo;t repeatedly bandaging the same injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CMMS is a great tool for analyzing the data and making meaningful decisions. Examples include reviewing work-order schedule compliance, ratios of preventive maintenance and repair work orders compared to total work orders, and taking necessary corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Readings: &lt;/strong&gt;Maintenance operations frequently gather readings on a variety of equipment such as boilers, chillers, etc. In a paper-based system, forms are filled out and filed away (never to be found again). Some companies have started using their CMMS to record and save these readings (i.e., pressure, temperature, etc.). The purpose of this data is to identify abnormal readings and correct problems to prevent failures. A CMMS is just the tool to accomplish that. Once you have defined a certain range and criteria, the CMMS will flag a warning immediately upon meeting those criteria. For example, if the temperature reading falls outside of a certain range, it will notify you instantly so you can take corrective action. Otherwise, it can turn into a catastrophic failure in the future. Maintenance planning can automatically incorporate usage and condition-based preventive maintenance, predictive failure maintenance and corrective maintenance resulting from abnormal readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Make the Most of Your Time: &lt;/strong&gt;CMMS can be an excellent tool to identify non-value-added activities and shorten process cycle time as part of a follow-up/continuous improvement program. Maintenance spends a great deal of time waiting for parts, approval, instructions and equipment to be available. A CMMS can help identify where exactly maintenance is losing most of the time, enabling you to analyze the situation and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow-up and continuous improvement hinge on the same often under-utilized quality of a CMMS &amp;mdash; data reporting. It is all well and good to track and store data, but it is useless if that data is never examined. By monitoring reports and completed work orders through a follow-up and continuous improvement process, you constantly make your operation more efficient. Higher efficiency means lower operating costs, larger savings and increased profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Start Lean Journey by Planning the Trip </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I speak with people about lean programs, I am often asked, &amp;ldquo;Where should we start?&amp;rdquo; While this sounds like a very simple question, it actually requires a lot of thought. However, the simple answer is that you must first decide where you want to go before you know where you should start. Think of it like this: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you want to go, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you have a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have a GPS for my car that is pretty high tech. It communicates with satellites that are orbiting thousands of miles above the Earth. It can tell me where I am, give turn-by-turn directions and even tell me how fast I am going. However, with all of that technology, if I can&amp;rsquo;t put in a final destination, the GPS is pretty useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same is true for lean, Six Sigma or whatever you call your continuous improvement effort. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you are trying to go, even the best lean program won&amp;rsquo;t help very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are mountains of information about lean, Toyota Production System and continuous improvement processes out there. You can read a book a week and probably spend several years digesting just what is written so far. You can hire consultants that can make a process lean down to the tenth of a second, and you can save a lot of money. You can even teach some of your folks about lean in the process. All of these things are good, but they are not exactly what we are after &amp;ndash; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should be able to very clearly and concisely articulate where it is that you want to go before you do any of the things above. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t start yet. When I ask this simple question to companies and people who ask me where to start, I usually get answers that may be accurate but aren&amp;rsquo;t really relevant. For example, I might hear, &amp;ldquo;We want to get better,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We want to save money.&amp;rdquo; While those are things that lean can help achieve, neither of them paints the picture of what you want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can read some of the lean and continuous improvement books out there to get ideas or talk to some lean professionals, but be sure to decide where you are trying to go before you take off on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the things you should consider include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have I gone through a reorganization that could impact the quality of my product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is changing on the economic landscape that will impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What new changes may come out of the new government administration that may change my business model?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What opportunities are being created right now that we need to capitalize on for the future?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are there &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; issues that may impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How old is our product offering, and is it time for a review?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the long-term corporate strategy, and how do we support that strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many other items that you should discuss as a team when formulating the vision for a continuous improvement program. The point is to have the conversations now before you start. Make sure you can clearly and consistently articulate what is important and what you are working toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge for you and your colleagues is to be able to clearly answer and articulate an answer to the question, &amp;ldquo;Why are we embracing continuous improvement?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/BiagquYOqmA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Standard Work Drives Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you were to ask an operator or even some leaders what standard work meant to them, you might get responses such as &amp;ldquo;standard operating procedures,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;work instructions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;check sheets.&amp;rdquo; These are all legitimately correct answers. What you might not get is that standard work is the basis for driving all continuous improvement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash; Taiichi Ohno&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This statement is often ignored as companies work to improve their performance. The initial attempt to quickly resolve issues so that the team can see action being taken may result in the essential element of continuous improvement &amp;ndash; root cause analysis&amp;mdash;being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An important part of truly understanding the relationship of variables on a process comes from stabilizing the effects of changes made to improve it. Traditionally, one may view the lack of this understanding in Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/0cdf685b-e10d-47b7-b28b-180c1c0e4a10_standard work image 1.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The intent here is to quickly take care of issues by putting into action what we believe to be the fixes necessary to the process. This type of &amp;ldquo;fire-fighting&amp;rdquo; usually results in busy activities that may not be truly focused on the larger root causes apparent in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying standard work to the process and understanding the effect of the changes will allow better learning for the operators and leaders. The effect of this method is presented in Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/19/e5c86b23-bfab-4775-82bb-a2bc69c0fcad_standard work image 2.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 285px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The critical component in this effort is using tools such as a fishbone diagram or creating a Pareto chart to detail and quantify the issues. The diligence and discipline of executing this is necessary for acceptance and use in your discovery of root cause analysis. At times the activity may be painful to start, but the benefits in learning by all will certainly outweigh the costs and will be welcomed and expected by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to understand the important variables you wish to measure. As you stabilize and improve your process, you will understand the barriers that had traditionally kept you from meeting your expectations. Remember, as Taiichi Ohno pointed out, &amp;ldquo;Where there is no standard, there can be no kaizen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/mmyotgJZJRE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Improve Productivity with Checklists</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/6/8/4ee865e3-dcc4-4c00-bbf3-167c41f84722_checklists.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 169px; float: left;" /&gt;As an unrepentant checklist fanatic/junkie, I recently had to pick myself up off the floor in an airport newsstand. There with all the romance novels and the latest silver-bullet management books was &lt;em&gt;The Checklist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; by Dr. Atul Gawande. A best-selling book about checklists? The world wants to read about checklists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the beginning of hope for the world. It is a great book that I obviously recommend reading. I also recommend giving copies of it to everyone you work with. The price of the book is nothing vs. the value it delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A practicing surgeon, Dr. Gawande goes over the incredible reductions in hospital deaths and infections achieved through the use of checklists. In an eight hospital study, there was a 36-percent drop in major surgical complications and a 47-percent drop in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Highly skilled, busy people forget basic, key things and don&amp;rsquo;t even realize it. Just think of the productivity improvement potential. What expensive capital projects can deliver this type of improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The point of this book is that with the growing complexity of everything these days, no one &amp;mdash; not even the best trained, most capable people &amp;mdash; can possibly remember everything. So let&amp;rsquo;s make sure we don&amp;rsquo;t miss any of the basic, routine, essential items &amp;mdash; the ones we&amp;rsquo;re most likely to forget. Use checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The book is a quick, enjoyable read, but it needs to be reread so it all sinks in and gets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other key points in the book are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Checklists need to include communication items, not just tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Checklists enable effective teamwork to the point that the more limited, knee-jerk, command-and-control approach just can&amp;rsquo;t compete.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How to build an actual useable checklist, how Boeing does it and how the aerospace giant builds checklists for alarm conditions. Focus on the key, basic, routine items that get missed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training by itself won&amp;rsquo;t succeed. Even the best trained people forget basic things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another related item I heard on the radio recently came from an interview with author Jonah Lehrer talking about his book &lt;em&gt;How We Decide&lt;/em&gt;. He described how easy it is to overload the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This is the relatively puny part of the brain responsible for organizing the conflicting signals coming from all of the other parts of the brain into making the best decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Stanford University study compared the resolve of some diet-conscious folks on whether to eat chocolate cake or fruit salad. They were split into two groups. One group worked on memorizing two-digit numbers, while the other worked on memorizing seven-digit numbers. The groups then had to make the dietary choice. The seven-digit group was more than twice as likely to choose the chocolate cake as compared to the two-digit group. The added mental effort affected their decision to make the responsible choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is another argument for using checklists &amp;mdash; to just plain reduce the workload on the brain so it can work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Currently working as a consultant, John Crossan retired after spending 30-plus years with the Clorox Company. His roles for much of the past 14 years were mainly focused on improving operations by fostering the installation and ongoing implementation of basic manufacturing and maintenance procedural mechanisms across 30 varied plants in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to Clorox, John also held operational and engineering roles with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the Burndy Corporation. He can be reached via e-mail at &lt;a href="mailto:john@johncrossan.com"&gt;john@johncrossan.com&lt;/a&gt; or online at &lt;a href="http://www.johncrossan.com/"&gt;www.johncrossan.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/LHGktqiF0Nk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ensure Planning and Scheduling Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do you initially train someone new to the planner/scheduler position? First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the selection process, as I see this as an issue in many organizations. Ideally, the planner/scheduler should be one of your best craftspeople. You have to compensate the position at a level at least equal to your first-level supervision. The compensation should include accounting for the average overtime earned as a craftsperson if you expect them to apply for the position. You will not get many applicants if you are asking them to accept a significant reduction in their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to being a highly skilled craftsperson, the candidate should have good computer skills, a positive attitude, people-oriented and be self-motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you have identified the right person, the obvious next step is to get that person trained. You generally have a couple of choices here. You can send them off to a class, or you can host an on-site course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to another question. How do you help guarantee success with planning and scheduling? Realize that you can send a planner/scheduler off to training, have them return and, despite their best efforts, the organization will not allow them to plan and schedule work. Providing the on-site course will allow you to educate supervisors, team leaders, managers, engineering personnel, production supervisors, production planners and anyone else who interacts with the maintenance work management process. Now everyone can understand not only the roles and responsibilities of the planner/scheduler, but also their own roles and responsibilities in relationship to the work management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I teach maintenance planning and scheduling classes, I want to share a number of approaches. There are a several methods and opinions on how to plan and schedule work. What I find is that some groups actually do a disservice to their course participants by not sharing a comprehensive approach with various methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the initial training is complete, recognize that you are only one-third to halfway done. After about one to two months, it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring in a coach. Ideally, the coach is an external resource who walks a mile beside the new planner/scheduler. The purpose of this is to observe the activities of the planner/scheduler and also the interactions within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I coach and mentor, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to determine if the planner/scheduler is applying the items learned in the class. Are they creating job plans? Is the continuous improvement loop in place? Is the planner/scheduler focused on the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to see how the supervisors are interacting. Do they understand their roles and the planner&amp;rsquo;s roles? Are work orders being completed and data entered into the CMMS? Is the organization aligned for proactive scheduling? These are just a few of the items that I address in my coaching sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of coaching sessions depends on the organization. It may only be one to two in total. Now, about retraining, a number of organizations bring me back on a semi-annual to annual basis to provide an overall best practices health check as a good method to determine if the organization is continuing to mature in its implementation efforts. If it has gone stagnant, I&amp;rsquo;ll point out the obstacles and help get them back on the road to success. Ultimately, this is my primary goal. I have a passion for maintenance and operations, so I really care about people being successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not an external resource, someone internally needs to remove the obstacles to ensure effective planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With respect to retraining, you should always be in a state of constant learning. That means reading articles and attending events that foster learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a two-day maintenance management course in California&amp;rsquo;s wine country, I met a planner/scheduler who attended the course the previous year. At the end of the course, I asked him why he chose to re-attend so soon afterward. He mentioned that he had forgotten a number of items, and the main one was creating job plans. Wow! Besides scheduling the work, this is one of the most important parts of planning and scheduling. This example highlights the need for retraining, especially if you opted not to provide coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/uwGGjHxfRmU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Value of Autonomous Operator Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What does autonomous operator maintenance mean? The &amp;ldquo;autonomous&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;me alone performing the maintenance tasks for which I am trained and qualified.&amp;rdquo; Is it something new? To those of us who knew cars before electronic ignition and computers, owning a car fostered a do-it-myself approach toward keeping it running. I always pumped my own gas, changed my oil and filters, and sometimes changed my belts. I could check the levels of fluids, read gauges and listen to the running engine for anomalies. Technology has given me diagnostic tools to at least identify engine problems. Prior to the industrial age, the operator set up, ran and maintained the equipment. The industrial revolution introduced specialists, and we redesigned the operator out of maintenance and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You say those are not operator duties? Why not? There are too many answers to that, which when really analyzed, cannot be supported. I cannot defend the indefensible. Rather than look at the &amp;ldquo;why nots,&amp;rdquo; how about looking at the &amp;ldquo;how can we make it happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The German Post developed new maintenance programs for several dozen new plants coming on line. For the preventive maintenance (PM) program, a condition-based computerized checklist would be mainly a column of step numbers and some performance annotations. The technician located the step number on the machine, and beside it were the instructions with pictures and adjustment limits. Essentially, it was a visual factory with the visuals in and on each machine. Operators were qualified to operate a machine based upon proper procedures, an ability to read performance indicators and maintain the material flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, the relationship grew between the operators and technicians to where operators could identify problems and, with the help of the techs, fix them. They also identified PM tasks that they could perform and did. All of this was done without management or operating procedures dictating them to do so. The operator and tech had joint ownership of the equipment. The visuals also helped the supervision to ascertain machine operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In several U.S. postal facilities, this happened in a similar fashion. It was not uncommon to see an operator crawling over a machine. However, when a &amp;ldquo;tie&amp;rdquo; showed up, things reverted quickly. Ties were people from outside the plant. What this did was free up the maintenance staff to work on continuous improvement and help monitor quality. How did management treat this? They indirectly facilitated it happening by providing guidance tied to several conditions, including safety of the employee and not to harm the equipment. Otherwise, they got out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How did this manifest itself in plant performance? It led to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved production and quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced unscheduled absences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced grievances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cleaner plant floors and restrooms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supervisors as coaches and resource providers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovations in maintenance programs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lower costs of performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Smiles at the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the late 1950s and 1960s, two terms came of age: work enrichment and work enlargement. These were used when discussing motivation and seen as ways to satisfy the higher needs of employees, as identified by Abraham Maslow. Today, they are considered to have the same meaning, which is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enlarging the work was applied to combining sequential horizontal tasks. Where there were four employees on an assembly, the work was redesigned for two, and some decision-making was incorporated into the work. It involved maybe building four models of the same unit, with the employee making decisions about parts and fit for the unique models from information for which he received training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enriching the work was a vertical enhancement. This involved W. Edwards Deming&amp;rsquo;s assignment of quality responsibility to the person doing the work, building a unit and then connecting it to a different unit using a different skill set, or a multi-skilled technician working on a hydraulic line on the wing of an airplane to allow him to open the skin, reroute electrical, fix the problem and close it all up. I ran into this at the American Airlines maintenance center in Tulsa, Okla., where the unions asked to be trained across craft lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both work enhancements are designed to give the employee some ownership and pride in a completed task where more than their brawn was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may want to consider how work was designed before the industrial age and assembly lines. What happened to the worker during the late 19th century and up to the mid-20th century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The role of Fredrick Taylor in his study of work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The tactics of the robber barons, which reduced the dignity of the worker to nil&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The necessary role of the unions and the dignity of the individual&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Laws passed by our government that established rule of engagement for the adversarial relationship of unions and management&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How that has affected our production, innovation and creativity into the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in the late 1950s, real breakthroughs were made in the subject of motivation and improved dignity for the worker. Acceptance and implementation were (and still are) the issues due to the history of the industrial era mentioned above. Two Americans who had been rejected by their own country introduced redesign of work to the Japanese: Deming with his quality programs and Mary Parker Follet with the concept of the employee being a citizen of the company and what that means in the recognition of dignity and accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This fit well into the Japanese concept of space or time. This redesign of the workplace was responsible for the manufacturing excellence after World War II. Deming got them out of the quality hole, and Mary set up the dignity citizenship of the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 1980s, the Japanese experience showed up in the U.S. with total productive maintenance, total quality management, self-directed teams, continuous improvement, kaizen, just-in-time and poka-yoke. All of that was built around the dignity of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe that work and learning are integral requirements of our character. They satisfy a spiritual need. We were designed to work and to reap the benefits of accomplishing a task. We need accomplishments and challenges to keep us striving into the future. Work is only part of the life career. We should learn how to design and use it to enhance the other parts. I would hope that this is still a mantra for our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/71xZ9alEIAo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Productivity Inc. Sponsors TPM Manager Certification Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Middle- and top-level executives can now obtain certification in total productive maintenance (TPM) through a program sponsored by Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TPM manager certification program is designed for executives at any company interested in increasing process capability, improving equipment reliability and establishing a culture of teamwork, which are all critical components of an effective continuous improvement initiative.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;TPM enables a company to move from being a reactive to a proactive maintenance organization focused on preventive, scheduled and corrective maintenance activities,&amp;rdquo; says Maureen Fahey, managing partner of Productivity Inc. &amp;ldquo;Moving from fix and repair to equipment management provides the flexibility necessary to substantially reduce costs and generate additional income by increasing overall capacity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over four non-consecutive weeks, participants experience a series of learning modules. In between the weeks of training, they are required to apply the methods they have learned in class to operations at their own companies. Participants who successfully complete the four-week training and mentoring program, pass the certification exam and demonstrate successful implementation of the techniques in their own facility are then certified by Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;More and more organizations are realizing that corporate profitability is built on asset reliability,&amp;rdquo; said Ellis New, senior management consultant for Productivity Inc. &amp;ldquo;As a result, it has become apparent that the lean manager can&amp;rsquo;t do it alone.&amp;nbsp;There is a need for a counterpart to manage the improvement initiative from the equipment process reliability side.&amp;nbsp;The TPM manager fills this need.&amp;nbsp;Having both a certified lean manager and certified TPM manager will provide organizations with the synergy they need to really succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Productivity Inc. and the Fisher College of Business also offer a lean manager certification program and a lean tool awareness certificate. The next TPM manager certification session starts Aug. 6, 2012, on the Ohio State University campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Roanoke Cement Receives Safety, Environmental Awards </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Roanoke Cement Company recently announced that its &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville, Va.,&lt;/span&gt; plant and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Castle Hayne, N.C.,&lt;/span&gt; terminal will be honored later this month for excellence in two different areas: environmental outreach and terminal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville&lt;/span&gt; plant is the winner of the Outreach Award for the 2012 Cement Industry Energy and Environmental Awards. Sponsored by the Portland Cement Association and &lt;i&gt;Cement Americas&lt;/i&gt; magazine, the awards are presented to individual cement facilities that exemplify the spirit of continuous environmental improvement and support this commitment with action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The outreach category credits activities that enhance community, employee and government relations. Included among the achievements and initiatives noted for the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Troutville&lt;/span&gt; plant were a fifth consecutive Energy Star award, the 2011 Virginia Statewide Mineral Mining Reclamation Award, the on-site mitigation plan and quarry expansion, participation in Habitat for Humanity and the American Cancer Society&amp;#39;s Relay for Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We manufacture an important building material and at the same time are dedicated stewards of our environment,&amp;quot; says &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Lance Clark&lt;/span&gt;, environmental manager. &amp;quot;After all, we work and live here, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second award will be given to the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Castle Hayne, N.C.,&lt;/span&gt; terminal for its exemplary safety record. The terminal has not had a lost-time accident in 15 years and was honored last fall by North Carolina Department of Labor Commissioner &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Cherie Berry&lt;/span&gt;, who presented the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot; to the terminal for ongoing, effective workplace safety and health management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both awards will be presented at the Portland Cement Association&amp;#39;s board meeting on &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;April 16, 2012,&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Chicago&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Use Checklists for a More Efficient Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years, I have spent much time in discussion over the use of checklists for equipment changeovers and startups in plants. I have explained, reasoned, rationalized, cajoled, appealed, beseeched, entreated, implored, pleaded, urged and even cried real tears in my efforts to get people to use checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So it was great to see a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found (amazingly) that hospitals using checklists in their operating room procedures suffer a much lower death rate than those that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I was glad to see the study, but my very first reaction on reading it was outrage, along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Operating rooms don&amp;rsquo;t routinely use checklists? What?&amp;rdquo; Hopefully, the study will ratchet up awareness and perhaps drive some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But experience has absolutely convinced me that there is something in the human psyche that fights back desperately against using checklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We need to get things done quickly. Checklists will slow us down. We know what we&amp;rsquo;re doing; we&amp;rsquo;ve done it a zillion times before.&amp;rdquo; Even with the best intentions in the world, these just are not correct statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, we&amp;rsquo;ve found on packaging lines that any missed item on a changeover checklist cost us at least 10 minutes of lost time on startup. In several cases, it resulted in some significant equipment damage, and who knows how many other times there were damage- or safety-related near-misses. Settings that weren&amp;rsquo;t changed, bolts that weren&amp;rsquo;t tightened, clamps left loose &amp;ndash; all completely unintentional, done by people who had done it many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human memory just isn&amp;rsquo;t reliable enough, especially if interrupted to briefly do something else &amp;hellip; or perhaps someone has a question or needs a hand momentarily. Once the mind has changed focus, all bets are off on memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A weakening memory in our culture seems to be treated as a real indicator of diminished capability, a sign of oncoming senility, the dreaded &amp;ldquo;senior moments.&amp;rdquo; But human memory isn&amp;rsquo;t a reliable mechanism at any age. We all forget our keys or where we left them or &amp;ldquo;what did I come into this room to get?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve seen even the smartest, most capable people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with forget things when distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can understand why surgeons, renowned for the magnitude of their egos, would resist anything that seems to suggest a compensation for a failing capability. But why then have airline pilots (with at least comparable egos) accepted checklists for many years. (Well, yes, the regulations say they have to, but if you talk to them, they say they just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even think of operating without them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mike Thomas, an associate who was a Navy pilot and then a long-time trainer of Navy and airline pilots, explains it as just a part of flying. From their very first exposure to airplanes, pilots work from checklists, and a key part of the trainer&amp;rsquo;s job is training in how to use checklists, just as much as training in the actual functions of the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly in plants, we&amp;rsquo;ve found when individuals are trained to perform tasks using checklists, they tend to continue using them. The difficulty comes when someone has been routinely performing a task before the checklist is developed. Even if they help develop the checklist, it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult for them to begin using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, we always get the argument that for pilots it&amp;rsquo;s a life-and-death situation (surgeons, too), and the same rigorous practices are just not necessary (and not affordable) in industry. Yet, when we started using checklists, things always got better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The simple answer then is just to make it a requirement for people to use checklists, and if they don&amp;rsquo;t, then there are consequences. But if you absolutely insist that people turn in completed checklists, then you&amp;rsquo;ll absolutely get completed checklists, because that&amp;rsquo;s what you asked for. Nothing says the checklist was actually used like it should have been. Unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s the story behind much reported checklist use. The requirement was a completed checklist, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have looked in many files and seen many pristine checklists and preventive maintenance (PM) work orders without any fingerprints, smudges or stains, and wondered how people could manage to keep them that clean out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Americans historically are not good at mindless obedience, but we are quite excellent at mindful disobedience, particularly when someone tries to force us to do something for which we don&amp;rsquo;t hold much value. That&amp;rsquo;s the way people in this country are typically wired, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s becoming the case in most other countries these days. We always push the limits, and we don&amp;rsquo;t take much for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(You know just one thing wrong on that checklist, even a typo, negates completely the value of the entire thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also had to talk about different ways to use checklists. If someone has performed a task countless times, it&amp;rsquo;s not very efficient for them to go step by step through a detailed listing, checking off each item as they do it. In that case, it&amp;rsquo;s OK to perform a small group of related tasks and then check them off. But it is never OK to perform all the tasks and then check them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have counseled people, &amp;ldquo;Why do you want to stress yourself, taking the risk of forgetting something? Why even try to remember? Use the checklist.&amp;rdquo; This is all about getting equipment started up and running well, as fast as possible, not completing mental improvement exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who deserves more respect &amp;ndash; the person who uses the checklist, completes the changeover perfectly and the equipment starts up and just runs, or the person who manages to do almost all those steps completely from memory and then we burn time trying to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you want to win trivia games at home, maybe even compete on Jeopardy or otherwise exhibit incredible memory prowess, that&amp;rsquo;s great, but memory gymnastic demonstrations don&amp;rsquo;t help us with more effective, efficient equipment changeovers or startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a plant where the qualification requirement for operating a piece of equipment was to be able to change it over completely from memory. This was a big piece of equipment with way more than 100 steps in the procedure. I got blank stares when I asked why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, what actually works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The use of checklists has to be mandatory, beyond debate. Just like safety glasses, ear protection, lockout safety, etc., they&amp;rsquo;re part of the job. But it takes much more than law-and-order enforcement to get successful ongoing use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to work with people and train them to do the job using the lists. Then it&amp;rsquo;s a routine, essential part of the process, and they get over the idea that it&amp;rsquo;s something extra, that it&amp;rsquo;s slowing them down.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You have to actually be out there, making sure that everyone has his or her checklist and is really using it, and finding any issues with the lists.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		We found laminated plastic checklists and grease pencils worked best.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Changeover follow-up meetings can help determine where people are struggling with the checklists. Identify time loss due to improper use. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for improvement, not blame. Blame tends to get you back again to mindful disobedience.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		You must have active, participative processes to continuously improve changeovers and startups that include keeping the checklists current and building ongoing ownership for them. It&amp;rsquo;s always amazing how ownership makes the whole process just so much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This means constant work for team leaders, supervisors and managers, but it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of their job. Most importantly, they themselves really have to believe that using checklists is the most effective, efficient approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Are All Equipment Factors Truly Equal? </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The traditional formula for overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) &amp;mdash; including speed, quality and uptime &amp;mdash; treated all three factors as equals and OEE as a measure of equipment effectiveness over a 24-hour period, assuming 24 hours was the required performance window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies have refined the calculation to fit the actual required performance window. Robert Williamson&amp;rsquo;s example was the window when a racecar was required to operate at peak performance. In your plant, it may be continuous operation for only one shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/3/13/cbccdd8b-0730-4831-ae23-54875c359ee7_Are all Factors Equal.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;The metric began to be useful as a plant-floor performance measurement and, from analyzing the three factors, an analytical tool to determine improvement opportunities. All three factors are really at the mercy of the operator, who is the most important person in the plant when equipment is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I submit that all three factors (speed, quality and uptime) are not necessarily one-to-one linear correlations. Does a percentage increase in speed maintain the same quality or a proportional decrease in quality? How about the relationship to downtime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly,&amp;nbsp;are the savings associated with a 1-percent increase in speed offset with the reprocessing costs of, say, a 1-percent decrease in quality? I found this factored into the formula by a plant that penalized the formula seven-fold for each percentage change in quality. In my question about the 1 percent, they had figured the quality-cost impact to be equal to seven times the savings of a 1-percent increase in speed. Therefore, the OEE formula was impacted by a quality change of 7 percent for each actual 1 percent in quality. Quality was indeed &amp;ldquo;job one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have you looked at the optimum OEE factors for your equipment in terms of costs associated with increases and decreases in the factors? In other words, do your total processing costs necessarily go down with an increase in OEE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have come to the conclusion that all involved must understand the impact of any change in an OEE factor in dollar terms. OEE for the sake of OEE can bankrupt you. Decide on the range of performance of each OEE factor that can be tolerated, and educate all concerned on how that was determined and the costs to the process from changes outside those ranges: rework, scrap, upstream and downstream performance, maintenance, consumables, work hours, overtime, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The biggest loss of continued games with OEE is the trust, confidence and morale of the employees. They are not blind to the effects of &amp;ldquo;increase the speed by 10 percent and we&amp;rsquo;ll get out quota tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/WlzpUB-VpN8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Selecting Reliability-Improvement Tools</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I started in maintenance, I loved looking at the tool catalogs and, of course, imagined how nice it would be to have one of those gigantic tool sets. You know, the tool set with something for every job. Similar to most of the other new guys, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to purchase that kind of tool set and had to settle for a much smaller one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, purchasing tools to increase my toolbox capability was based on need and understanding of the function of the tool. This proved to be a great way to learn how to use my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If in the beginning I was able to purchase the dream set, I probably would not utilize half the tools because I would find myself overwhelmed and sticking to the core tools I understand and only occasionally running across something that I might find a use for. That would have not been a very good investment. By investing in tools as I understand their function, I am able to get the most out of them, and they will get used because I am more aware of them being there by the &amp;ldquo;new toy&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management and improvement tools are the same way. It is easy to dream of having a facility with all of the tools working harmoniously together and being utilized to their fullest extent. The problem is this rarely happens. Most successful programs start with the choice of one or two core tools and then add on as function and need permit. This allows people time to get to understand the tools and develop habits that are effective in application of the tools. As time goes along, those people are better equipped to be able to adapt to more tools in their toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen many horror stories in the making of companies who think that throwing money at problems automatically makes them better and eventually leads to trouble-free bliss. Throwing money or resources at problems often causes more confusion and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of this is a situation where I watched a maintenance manager and a maintenance supervisor replacing buckets on a standard bucket elevator that would normally be a one-man (or possibly two-man) job. The problem was that they were being watched by two Class A mechanics and one Class B mechanic, who were providing the tools for the manager and supervisor to use. Inefficiency has no limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You might ask, &amp;ldquo;What is the right tool for me to start with?&amp;rdquo; I recommend determining what your biggest headache is and then finding the tool to fix it. The tools can range from standard management tools to advanced tools that are designed to deal with a specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing I recommend before undertaking a bunch of the other tools is a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This will provide a solid foundation for some of the other tools to be added later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another recommendation is to implement a reliability program prior to investing in predictive maintenance tools, because it may help you determine which predictive tools you need or want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/ZRYqYScl7a0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Make Problem-Solving Simple in Your Plant </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to problem-solving activities in plants and how to go about them, the typical engineering-oriented approach tends to be very rigorous and detailed, with the objective of getting to the absolute correct technical solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this level of rigor seems perhaps commendable, the question to ask is, &amp;ldquo;What is the value of taking extended time to rigorously solve a single issue if the majority of the attendees don&amp;rsquo;t see any way that they can apply such a process to the frequent issues they must deal with?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rigorous approach is great when you&amp;rsquo;re working with left-brain-dominant engineers, but it is not for everyone. Of course, to be realistic, there are many problems that need a very rigorous process. However, what we&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to do in the majority of these plant exercises is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get people to realize the value in gathering enough accurate information to understand an issue before coming up with solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Get them excited about somewhat systematically coming up with solutions to problems as a group, valuing different perspectives and input.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have them take the initiative to put the solutions in place with the communication and commitment needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the right answer, it&amp;rsquo;s at least an effort to make an improvement over what was in place before. Some learning came from the exercise, and the next effort will be better. The important thing is that you&amp;rsquo;re developing ownership. It&amp;rsquo;s about getting people out of the &amp;ldquo;just show up and do what you&amp;rsquo;re told&amp;rdquo; mode. That&amp;rsquo;s the big piece in continuing to get ongoing improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most problems in plants are just not that difficult. Many issues tend to come back to lack of equipment care, lack of knowledge and basic processes. It&amp;rsquo;s not normally tied to some fundamental design deficiency in equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Identifying the causes and solutions is the easy part. Getting the communication, involvement and commitment to get the solutions bought into and actually implemented in a timely manner is the bigger problem. This is also the essential part, so people don&amp;rsquo;t give up, and you can build on the enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Currently working as a consultant, John Crossan retired after spending 30-plus years with the Clorox Company. His roles for much of the past 14 years were mainly focused on improving operations by fostering the installation and ongoing implementation of basic manufacturing and maintenance procedural mechanisms across 30 varied plants in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to Clorox, John also held operational and engineering roles with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and the Burndy Corporation.

            <title>People Make the Difference in Maintenance and Reliability Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people may have gravitated to the maintenance and reliability industry because of the desire to work with machinery. I was trained in engineering and understand how machines operate and work. Machines behave in logical ways. They all follow the mechanical and electrical laws of nature. Engineers are immersed in those laws in their years of schooling. People in the maintenance field thrive on knowing that machinery works and behaves in logical ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous article for &lt;em&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/em&gt;, I pointed out the thought similarities between an organization&amp;rsquo;s safety improvement effort and a maintenance and reliability improvement effort. The idea that zero injuries are possible is a key concept for any safety effort to gain momentum, but how does a plant or an organization really improve safety results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I have experienced over the past 30 years is a continual and steady safety improvement effort. In the early years, much of the emphasis was on identification and elimination of unsafe conditions. The focus was on the machinery and the physical facility. The elimination of unsafe conditions was a normal and comfortable task for many in plant operations, production and maintenance. It was easy to identify and fix defects in machines and facilities that could cause an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our efforts in these areas were successful and improved safety. However, we still experienced injuries. Many of these injuries were not caused by unsafe conditions but by the unsafe acts of our employees. As our organization recognized this fact, more work and concentration was put on preventing injuries due to unsafe acts. We have used various programs to improve our results in the past. Several of the programs used were the STOP program and TAKE 2 program, both created by E.I. DuPont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past several years, we used a program that concentrated on people&amp;rsquo;s behaviors by enlisting these people in observing each other. These observations help remind everyone to think and behave safely. The emphasis was on changing the culture and attitude of the organization as well as on the people and how each person behaves. We have seen substantial improvement in safety results over the past few decades due to this focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a similarity in leading a maintenance and reliability improvement effort and a safety improvement effort. Today, many of these maintenance and reliability improvement efforts are solely concentrating on the machinery. The program leaders may become enamored with the new technical tools that have exponentially become more capable and less expensive in the past 30 years. The condition-monitoring tools and precision-maintenance tools have dominated the industry&amp;rsquo;s attention in the past several years. Many others have focused on the analysis processes such as reliability-centered maintenance and root-cause analysis. All of these tools and programs are fairly technical and logical in nature. The tools and their application are very comfortable to maintenance and reliability leaders, managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Certainly, any effort needs to have competency in these technical skills. The need to understand how machinery operates, how it can fail and how to prevent failure is extremely important and foundational to any improvement effort. However, this aspect is the easiest part to lead an organization in the maintenance and reliability improvement effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe the most difficult but most beneficial aspect of leading the maintenance and reliability improvement effort is managing the change process in organizations. The behavior change process from a reactive state to a proactive state is a challenging transition. Leadership of this change process needs to focus on each employee&amp;rsquo;s attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. This certainly is not a comfortable action for most leaders. Employees must believe that machine failures can be prevented by proper design, operation and preventive maintenance strategies. This attitude change is facilitated by continual education on the fundamentals of maintenance and reliability principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a period of time, success leads the organization eventually to believe that zero failures are possible. When this belief takes hold, the organization begins to accelerate toward a true proactive state. Each person in an organization is important to enlist in this change endeavor. It happens one person at a time through various stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changing an organization&amp;rsquo;s behaviors and actions on a daily basis is one of the key areas that will accelerate the maintenance and reliability process. Are you and your organization&amp;rsquo;s leaders educated in change management principles and ready for this needed behavior change effort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/UGYixQBxbT8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Learning Can Change Behavior, Produce Results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many people are familiar with A3 analysis as a management process &amp;ndash; a methodology for thinking, planning, problem-solving and then starting all over again. In this process, you begin by defining the problem, describing the current conditions, and defining goals and targets (what&amp;rsquo;s the desired outcome?). Next, you analyze what has caused the gap between current conditions and the desired outcome, and you design a countermeasure to help you reach the future state. Then, the A3 process calls for planning who will do what, plus a follow-up step to capture what has happened, what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what issues remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many elements of this A3 analysis apply to planning for and implementing effective learning strategies. There&amp;rsquo;s a big gap when it comes to workplace learning &amp;ndash; the gap between what often constitutes training and the desired outcome of improved performance. If you invest in learning and nothing changes, has learning taken place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often we invest our time and money in a learning event only to find that when we return to our daily work, we keep doing the same things. It all sounds so good, and you are so excited to put the new methods and tools you have learned into practice, but when you get back to the workplace, the boss is still asking the same questions and expecting the same results. The processes in your workplace could also be different than those described in the class, causing you to struggle with how to apply what you have learned in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning is not an event &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a process. The classroom is important, but the fact is that most learning takes place when we apply the tools and techniques we discovered in the learning event. Learning is a process of alignment, assimilation and application. We&amp;#39;ll call this the 3A learning process. Only by completing all three steps of this process can we change behavior to produce desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Align&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before participating in a learning event, participants should have a thorough understanding of what they are expected to learn, how their behavior is expected to change, the results they are expected to achieve and how these results contribute to the overall goals of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When this step is skipped, participants attend the learning event and are left entirely on their own to determine what they are supposed to do with what they learn. This often leads to a disconnect between participants and their leaders when they return to the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, when you attend a Leading People class with a dozen learning objectives, you discover some new tools for gaining group consensus. You know this is something you can apply right away to make some decisions in your work team. Returning to work, you share your ideas with your manager only to find that what your manager really wanted you to learn was how to facilitate the creation of a team vision. This was covered in the class, but not knowing this was why you had been selected to attend the class, you focused your attention on what you perceived to be an important skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the A3 management process requires both an assessment of the current state and a description of the desired outcome, 3A learning requires managers and employees to clearly define the desired outcome before the learning event takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assimilate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the learning event, you focus on assimilating the learning that resonates with you. An effective learning event will engage you in applying what you already know in building relevant skills and knowledge that you decide to focus on and practice in the class. If these vital elements of an effective learning event are part of the assimilation, then you will return to work prepared to apply what you have learned. If not, then you may have an awareness of and even a desire to apply these tools but no practical experience in how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether assimilation happens effectively largely depends on who is leading your learning event. An instructor is a content resource and usually shares knowledge through writing or lectures, appearing as a &amp;ldquo;sage on the stage.&amp;rdquo; A facilitator is a process manager first and a content resource second. Facilitators use their knowledge of how people learn to create an active environment that embraces participants&amp;rsquo; prior knowledge and unique learning styles. When they facilitate, they appear as a &amp;ldquo;guide by the side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thinking back to the A3 management process, when you plan a countermeasure to an existing gap or problem, you want to plan the best countermeasure possible. When it comes to learning events, seek out events that take into account your learning style, your skills and your knowledge. This will ensure what you learn will stick with you when returning to work to apply what you have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Apply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying what you have learned is where 80 percent of the learning takes place. This involves using the skills and knowledge within your work environment that makes the learning stick, causing a behavior change that produces desired results. In this step, it is important that you experience early success. This early success depends on leadership support and coaching. Left on your own, you are likely to discover unique factors in your work environment that make it difficult to apply what you have learned. The system and often the people resist change. Since learning is changing behavior, you will encounter resistance. You will need someone supporting you with encouragement, coaching and running interference as you attempt to adapt your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the A3 management process requires a follow-up step to review the outcome and a follow-up step to capture what has happened, what was learned and what issues remain, the 3A learning process requires the manager and employee to evaluate the learning that has taken place, the progress of changing behavior and how the environment is adapting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you consider your future investments in training, remember the 3A learning process &amp;ndash; align, assimilate and apply &amp;ndash; and the result will be learning that changes behavior to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken to Invest $225 Million at Ohio Steel Plant </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After securing a new five-year labor agreement, officials at the Timken Company recently announced they will move forward with a $225-million investment at the Faircrest Steel Plant in Stark County, Ohio. With this investment, the specialty alloy steel manufacturer will improve productivity, expand its product range and increase capacity to serve growing demand for alloy steel bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are seeing growing demand for Timken specialty steel to support the most demanding energy and industrial applications,&amp;quot; said Salvatore J. Miraglia Jr., Timken&amp;rsquo;s president. &amp;quot;This is the right time to make the kind of investment that will improve our operating performance while also expanding our capacity and size range for these products. Combined, that will strengthen our ability to serve these important industries and position the business for continued profitable growth and greater shareholder value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ratification of a new extended labor agreement between Timken and members of United Steelworkers (USW) Local&amp;shy;&amp;shy; 1123 established workforce stability through project construction and startup in 2014. The labor agreement covers four facilities in Stark County through September 2017 and replaces an agreement that would have expired in the midst of the project&amp;#39;s startup in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ladle refiner and large-bloom continuous caster are central to the productivity gains from the investment. The new equipment also is expected to increase the Faircrest operation&amp;#39;s shippable capacity by 25 percent and enable the production of a broader range of large-diameter bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have a highly skilled, capable workforce committed to continuous improvement,&amp;quot; said Thomas D. Moline, vice president of steel manufacturing. &amp;quot;Our team understands what it takes to make custom-melted, high-quality alloy bars and tubes that meet our customers&amp;#39; exacting metallurgical requirements. This investment, which is the largest since opening the plant in 1985, builds on those skills to improve our productivity while giving us the ability to offer even more to the customers who rely on us for their own success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Known for its power-transmission products that include bearings, gears and related components, Timken reported sales of $5.2 billion in 2011 with 21,000 people operating from locations in 30 countries.

            <title>3 Keys for Improved Plant Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The people who work for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in airports know what it is like to be in a fishbowl. They always perform to an impatient, critical, assessing audience, as most of us are forced to watch them work for much longer than we want. Of course, if you&amp;rsquo;re just standing in line impatiently waiting, then observing and criticizing is really all you have to do (or you can talk loudly on your cellphone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of us standing there usually can identify some individual who might be better suited to another line of work. Some of the frustrated folks standing around me have been pretty obnoxious and verbal about this on occasion. There are, however, many TSA workers who clearly feel that they&amp;rsquo;re dealing with customers and try to make the process smoother, quicker and even friendlier for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This started me thinking about all the various plant maintenance and manufacturing assessments I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in over the years, and the success (or not) of the various improvement efforts tied to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After reading the book &amp;ldquo;How We Decide&amp;rdquo; by Jonah Lehrer, I was surprised to find that all of the supposedly rational judgments I thought I was making over the years were really mostly emotional. The emotional part of the brain is just tremendously more capable and can deal with vastly more information than the puny little rational part. I guess I started to realize maybe how I really was making these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Basically, the actual assessment really doesn&amp;rsquo;t take very long &amp;ndash; just enough time to walk around the place, observe and talk to some people. What takes time is compiling the evidence to support the assessment and using that for the discussions that help the plant build its improvement plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thinking about it, in judging a plant, the emotional brain is getting a fix on two things &amp;mdash; intensity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Intensity is the overall purposefulness that people display, a sense that they value their time and their function as important, and they need to do the most with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other would be respect in its many forms &amp;ndash; respect for the product, respect for the equipment, respect for the facility, respect for each other, respect for their customers, respect for managers and managers having respect for employees (an absence of &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;them&amp;rdquo; statements and behavior on both parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the places I always make a point of visiting is the plant washroom. This is where the overall level of respect (in its many forms) is pretty much immediately evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Going a step further, the intensity really comes from the respect. If you value what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, then you tend to do it well. If the value is not there, then doing it well is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third thing would be the work processes (or lack of them) that are in place. We can work all we want on the actual processes that just do the work, but if the intensity and respect are not there, the very best we can hope for is mediocre. However, if we incorporate feedback mechanisms into these work processes to routinely involve and develop people, then the respect and intensity will come. This is how we truly get on the road to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Case IH Plant Receives Energy Efficiency Certification </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/13/3098c643-73d7-45e9-9dfb-3674c5b8c4b5_Case_IH_Plant.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 166px; height: 174px; float: left;" /&gt;The Case IH tractor plant in Racine, Wis., was recently accredited with ISO 50001 certification for energy management. The certification is intended to provide organizations with the framework for integrating energy practices into their management procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To achieve ISO 50001 certification, the Racine tractor plant was audited by a third-party firm, UL-DQS, which recommended the plant to the American National Accreditation Board (ANAB). Under its current energy management system, the plant will continue to improve its energy efficiency and has formalized its process, tools, roles and responsibilities to ensure the system&amp;rsquo;s sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;This accreditation for ISO 50001 recognizes the Racine plant&amp;rsquo;s continuous improvement in energy efficiency and Case IH&amp;rsquo;s long-term commitment to reducing its environmental impact,&amp;rdquo; says Steve Tyler, Racine plant manager. &amp;ldquo;This certification is another testament to this world-class manufacturing facility and can be a source of pride for our employees and the community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ISO 50001 certification for energy management is the Racine plant&amp;rsquo;s fourth certification. It also has been certified ISO 9001 for quality management systems, ISO 14001 for environmental efficiency and OHSAS 18001 for health and safety. The plant was also named a &amp;quot;Plant of Excellence&amp;quot; by Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), a leading company in inspection, verification, testing and certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Racine plant is home to the Case IH Magnum Series tractors and also produces transmissions and final drives for Axial-Flow combines and Module Express cotton pickers, cabs for the Patriot sprayers, and axles and valves for Steiger Series tractors.

            <title>Maintenance Planning and Scheduling for Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/1/8/d9cac24a-2254-4f7a-87c2-c21621ca39bc_planning-scheduling.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While on a recent flight to Atlanta, I was leafing through a maintenance book when the person across the aisle struck up a conversation. Turns out, he worked as a veteran maintenance supervisor in a large mill where he has worked for the last two years. He spoke about how things were bad from a reactive standpoint and had gotten worse after the mill downsized. As part of the downsizing effort, they had removed some key players and replaced them with some not-so-key players. We talked about how their maintenance planning and scheduling activities were progressing, to which he was disappointed in the progress they had achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that he had two maintenance planners/schedulers with a span of control of about 1:25, yet he was still doing a tremendous amount of planning and scheduling himself. He commented that the span of 1:25 fell within the best practices guidelines. In addition, he mentioned from previous training that he learned that a planner should be able to plan three jobs per day, but the planners were unable to accomplish this amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some additional conversation, we came to understand some of the opportunities present at the mill. I bet you could relate to the rest of the story: Management is dysfunctional. The storeroom is in disarray. The CMMS/EAM system was poorly implemented, and if a part existed in stores, you could not find it in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So let&amp;rsquo;s look as some possible solutions to help this gentleman. There never is but one silver bullet that will fix this stuff, and often it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that a good job plan can start out with three items: the crafts required, the estimated hours needed, and the parts and materials. These three items are an excellent start, provided that you have a process for continuous improvement, also called a feedback loop. When the crafts execute the job, they should write down additional information to improve the plan, such as tools or additional parts required and task steps. When the planner gets this information back, he updates the plan so it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the next use. You might be able to enlist the help of a clerical person (if you are short on planner resources) who does well tippy-tapping on the keyboard. By approaching job plans in this manner, you may find that a planner can successfully plan more than three jobs per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all of that said, you still may find planning to be a bottleneck if you are very reactive and the supporting systems have not been well-implemented. While maintenance planning and scheduling can happen when using a paper system instead of computerized tools, it&amp;rsquo;s still dependent on the supporting structures for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if your purchasing process is a nightmare, that can slow down the efforts. If the storeroom and materials management areas are poorly implemented and in shambles, this can affect the planning and scheduling processes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of other factors that can influence maintenance planning and scheduling success, like the support of maintenance supervision. Now you can see why I tell people that formal maintenance planning and scheduling training is only half of the education required. Formal training should be followed up with coaching and mentoring for the maintenance planners/schedulers. This will help identify and enable the removal of obstacles that impede the planning and scheduling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also may want to consider reducing the span of control for your maintenance planners/schedulers. The recommended span of control for maintenance planning and scheduling is 15 to 30 craftspeople per maintenance planner. Supervision is recommended at eight to 15 crafts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/EfVZsRwp2yE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Discipline and Diligence Are Key for Root Cause Analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so now you have put up these fancy (or so you think fancy) check sheets and charts for standard work, expecting the improvements to happen. Things go well for the first couple of days or weeks &amp;ndash; if you are lucky. Everyone is abuzz with this focus of action, but then it begins to degrade. What is happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diligence and discipline of execution are important underlying details of root cause analysis. The new methods are oftentimes person dependent rather than process dependent. So, we find that the owner maintaining this new system goes on vacation, and the team finds itself quickly back where they started &amp;ndash; frustrated and not knowing where to head next. These new methods fall to the side and are sometimes even removed in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The important aspect of this improvement process is applying consistent performance through discipline. The team members must be able to apply the techniques in order to achieve the performance levels and results expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many of you have ever heard the team mention that we start these new things, expect their input for solving the issues and then there is no follow-through? I am sure I am not alone, or at least hope I am not. If so, then we have not done our due diligence in really creating the importance of our improvement activities and have not committed to training our folks on the discipline of what is expected and holding the team to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all have a responsibility to uphold our commitment of training our personnel on what is expected (when we are there or away). It is this key element that will secure the buy-in needed to really drive our improvement process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/ILy_PlGJ36A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Keys to Maintain Equipment Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is so much similarity in all that we do within the maintenance planning and scheduling world that compares to other separate and distinct functions. Let me explain. Borrowing from root cause analysis process methods, I trust you are familiar with Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams). These diagrams are one method that is used for product design, quality defect avoidance or variation, or to identify factors that lead to some event, hence the use in root cause analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The categories typically include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man (people)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements to perform the tasks, including time estimates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: Any equipment, tools, etc., needed to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: Consumables, parts required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: Data generated from the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these items combine together to create some output or event. In the case of maintenance planning and scheduling, hopefully they combine to maintain or restore the reliability of equipment, as an example. See, in all we do, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that every product (i.e., maintaining equipment) is the result of a process. Let&amp;rsquo;s break them down individually for maintenance planning and scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Man: People or staffing (which crafts?), skill requirements, number of people, contractors or vendors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Methods: The job-plan task steps and sequence; items such as permits, manuals and so forth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Machines: What special tools (man lift, ladder, etc.) are needed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Materials: What consumables or parts are needed to restore the equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measurements: What do we need to know to improve the job plan? In the case of a condition-based monitoring task, we can take measurements to find something in the act of failing to allow planned restoration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, all of these items roll up to complete the job plan and job package that should be created by the maintenance planner. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to complete all of these items, which three should I focus on first to ensure that I could drive craft effectiveness? From a maintenance scheduling perspective, I need the manpower requirements, estimated hours and the materials, but it can&amp;rsquo;t stop there. The only way that it&amp;rsquo;s effective is if I have a continuous improvement loop that relies on the feedback of the technicians to improve the job plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/f6HEKIkcHbw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Improve Equipment Effectiveness by Targeting 11 Major Losses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Everyone wants a silver bullet to address the competitive environment pressuring profits and, ultimately, jobs in North America. Having transitioned from a controls engineer to a maintenance manager to an operations manager, I can attest to the quest for that silver bullet. The reality is that few levers exist for you to pull that will radically improve the profitability of your organization. With global markets and price supports, commodity costs are generally fixed. The same applies to prices received for your company&amp;rsquo;s products or services. Labor markets and costs are somewhat fixed as well. With the exception of fuel surcharges, logistics costs are generally set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance or operations manager, your span of control is bound by the four walls of your site. With energy prices, some opportunities exist for cost reduction in pursuing energy audits and savings activities. The largest opportunity is focusing your efforts on improving equipment effectiveness by targeting the 11 major losses. In targeting these losses, it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to return more than 400 percent and improve employee engagement in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 11 losses are divided into four major categories: planned shutdown, downtime, performance efficiency and quality losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Planned shutdown losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category is not often considered a loss, and it can be a hidden opportunity to produce product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 1 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost capacity due to production not being scheduled, equipment shut off for breaks, and shift changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The plant may only run Monday through Friday, leaving Saturday and Sunday available. In a three-shift operation, the third shift may be dedicated for maintenance. At one site, the operators in an area would shut down baggers as they went to break. Enforcing a break schedule to ensure every machine was covered during breaks solved the loss. In another area, the ability existed to automatically trend the bagger performance. Thirty minutes before every shift change, the bagger would be shut off to change the code dates. The baggers would not restart until the next shift came onto the floor and got the handoff from the previous shift. Bringing a heightened awareness by posting the trends solved this loss.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Capacity lost to planned maintenance. &lt;/strong&gt;Does it take an entire shift every day to do planned maintenance? Proper planning and scheduling procedures with audit and continuous improvement loops are utilized to address this loss. The maintenance supervisor should target 65 percent of his or her time on the floor ensuring the jobs are moving along and removing any obstacles. Take NASCAR as an example. In 1950, a pit stop took nearly four minutes. Today, the pit crew takes less than 20 seconds to put the car back on the track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Downtime losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes the following areas of loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 3 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The obvious equipment failures or breakdowns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re not tracking downtime or don&amp;rsquo;t believe the numbers, focus on the major events. To start, document the critical events that lose two hours or more. Create a simple root cause analysis form to track them. Empower a cross-functional team of maintenance and operations to determine the root cause and not blame. Action the findings to ensure the event never occurs again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 4 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The setup and changeover to change from one product or lot to another. &lt;/strong&gt;Empower your employees to develop new methods that reduce these times. In one area, reducing the time required for Clean In Place (CIP) cycles yielded the same cleaning levels but reduced the overall changeover time by more than one hour.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 5 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time required to make the tool changes and part changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Tools like single-minute exchange of dies (SMED) break down these changeovers into single steps. In the changeover on a flow wrapping system, there were 247 steps identified, which required 2.5 hours to complete. After initiating SMED, the changeover was reduced to 15 steps and the time to 30 minutes. The approaches used in NASCAR are very similar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 6 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The startup and shutdown of equipment and processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop startup and shutdown sequences everyone must follow based on best practices from equipment operators. Create a chart that sequences every task on the startup or shutdown. Look for opportunities for parallel tasks. Empower a maintenance and operations team to reduce the amount of time required for each sequence. Determine the feasibility of automating all or portions of the events in the control system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Performance-efficiency losses: &lt;/strong&gt;This category includes losses where equipment speed, output or capacity is not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 7 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment minor stops such as paper tearing out of wrapper or film not tracking correctly can add up over time.&lt;/strong&gt; These machine hiccups are not generally tracked but when totaled are amazing. Minor stops of six minutes each shift occurring over a three-shift, five-day operation add up to 75 hours lost in a 50-week year. Fix this to return almost 10 shifts of capacity for one machine alone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 8 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower output (productivity) from equipment that is operated at less than design speed or cycle times. &lt;/strong&gt;With age and wear, machines tend to run slower. A 10 percent loss is a common occurrence. Operators run the equipment slower, compensating in the belief of reducing the failures or minor stops. Lack of communications can play a role with this type of loss. Maintenance slowed a case packer until a repair was made. After the repair was complete, operators were running the equipment at the lower rate weeks later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Quality losses: &lt;/strong&gt;These losses make up the final category. Quality products can&amp;rsquo;t be made from poorly maintained equipment nor can quality be maintained from equipment that is consistently out of specification. If the equipment is running at design rate and is available on demand, yet it is not producing quality product, it&amp;rsquo;s just making waste at rate. Not only do you lose capacity and labor, you lose the material costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 9 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;The losses generated in waste or scrap is straightforward. It&amp;rsquo;s not just waste, it is lost capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 10 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Product that is defective or not saleable is a major loss. Even if it can be reworked or recycled, it costs valuable labor and capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Loss 11 &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Startups and shutdowns create yield or transition losses. During the startup or shutdown, quality product is not produced and is wasted. Solutions identified in Loss 6 above can be utilized to reduce the ramp-up or ramp-down losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with this knowledge, challenge yourself by walking around your site and determine where the opportunities for improvement are available. You might be surprised when flipping over the unturned stones. Stop these losses by developing a program of maintenance for your equipment to assure capacity. Require support from all groups involved with the daily use of the equipment and solicit input from employees at all levels within your company. Using these engaged employees, create a passion for performance and provide quantifiable results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Value of Risk-based Asset Management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With the forming of ISO Technical Committee 251, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that asset management will soon have a standard. Now is the time to educate ourselves about the value that optimized asset management creates. Based on the release of ISO 9001, Quality Management Systems &amp;ndash; Requirements, there is a valid expectation of hype, confusion and a large outpouring of funds as companies work to achieve compliance. Luckily, like quality management, asset management is about identifying, mitigating and eliminating risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Formalizing, documenting and validating our asset management plan seem like a significant undertaking. Since the planning committee is using BSI PAS 55 as a starting place, it is likely that the core of the specification will remain valid. Part 2 of this specification provides the guidelines for application and also includes seven items that can be reviewed by an organization to see how they compare to the key 28 elements of part 1. Using LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Excellence methodology, along with best practices in risk-based asset management, we have developed a self-assessment tool that you can use to evaluate the maturity of your asset management in preparation for the ISO standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan, do, check, act cycle shown in Figure 1 is the foundation of continuous improvement and is also the foundation of an optimized asset management system. Developing a management plan that accounts for risk, and therefore cost, brings a significant advantage to the bottom line. Asset management is a basic corporate responsibility, and yet no real standards will exist until sometime between 2012 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/e05d7c8b-a7d7-485d-9ef8-9d86c7b11c8f_figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 0px; width: 642px; height: 427px; float: left;" /&gt;Figure 1. The Plan, Do, Check, Act Cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is certain that the new standard will illustrate the importance of transaction-level business processes, such as production and maintenance planning and scheduling. It will also require clearly communicated performance monitoring to maximize corporate resources and profitability. Typically, corporate objectives, business processes and information systems are not well integrated. This tends to hide some of our limiting factors and risks, and prevents us from optimizing our asset performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider the risk associated with drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the complexity of the asset deemed to prevent blowouts below. The report referenced in Figure 2 stated that the investigation team found indication of potential weaknesses in the testing regime and maintenance management system for the blowout preventer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/e40dce51-bda8-44ec-9ba8-64ef7b926017_Figure 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 0px; width: 642px; height: 493px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 2. Illustration from the Deepwater Horizon Investigation Report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These findings emphasize the value in an optimized asset management system and the importance of risk management as a significant component of that system. To identify gaps that could compromise an asset management strategy, the PAS 55 specification includes seven review areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizational strategic plan&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Legal, regulatory and mandatory requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification and evaluation of asset management risks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Existing asset management practices, processes, and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Asset and asset system performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Investigation of incidents, accidents and emergencies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Management systems, competencies, internal and external resources&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Risk-based Asset Management Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Considering the huge impact to the environment along with the health, safety and reputation of the companies involved, a risk-based asset management strategy that provides transparency to risk is essential for an organization&amp;rsquo;s survival. This is impossible without a formalized asset management system in place. The four phases in LCE&amp;rsquo;s risk-based asset management model, Figure 3, is necessary for risk management and creating operational stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/e179c020-420f-4346-b1fe-8b4f87d42d59_Figure 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 227px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 3. LCE&amp;rsquo;s Risk-based Asset Management Model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Classify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;Once we understand the strategic plan and corporate objectives and how our asset management system supports them, we must classify our assets. This requires us to have an understanding of the logical flow and how value is created through the systems, processes, lines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Value stream mapping, Figure 4, documents the material and information flow from inception to disposition of product. The map captures each step of the process with defined parameters used to trend performance. Value stream mapping helps us understand where the value lies in a sequential process flow. It is the first step in waste elimination and provides two features required for developing our risk-based asset management strategy: the performance measures at each process and the logical approach to hierarchy. Whether we use value stream mapping, process flow charting or some other lean or industrial engineering tool, the idea here is that we clearly define each process in a logical manner that has a set of design specifications that we can use to identify trends. Once we accomplish this we can develop a logical sequence to catalog our assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/aeb0ed65-1fa8-4c3b-8173-14671f983090_Figure 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 280px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 4. Example of a Value Stream Map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;Once we have a documented diagram to refer to, we can then catalog assets by assigning them to asset types. Asset types allow logical groupings of like assets, similar functional failures and control strategies. At this point we must choose a model to map the relationship between the assets. The most common model is hierarchy, which is a parent-child relationship like in a refinery. Next is a matrix model, which has significant interfaces between the assets such that a parent-child relationship cannot be considered, like in distillation. The third model is the network model used for linear assets such as pipelines and railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/94f2fa47-c049-4d50-967e-b4ce808158dc_Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 508px; height: 199px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 5. Asset Relationship Models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Analyze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once we have cataloged our assets, we then focus on developing the methodology for applying a criticality analysis to our assets. This should involve a cross-functional team of stakeholders in the value stream. The benefit of the value stream mapping and defined taxonomy will quickly be realized during this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When developing our method for applying criticality, Figure 6, it may be wise to first look at the system level (routinely considered level 5). This will then allow us to prioritize the systems to apply a more thorough analysis to the component or asset level (level 7). This analysis should consider impact to corporate objectives, replacement asset value, impact to value stream, impact on reputation, single point failure and impact on EHS regulations and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The overarching principle regarding equipment criticality analysis is that it aligns with corporate objectives and is accepted as the method to assign priority. A strategy must be selected to establish a criticality scale. The best practice in establishing this scale is to have both a qualitative and quantitative dimension to leverage both the experience of seasoned professionals and that of published standards and specifications for our industry. This allows qualitative assessments to be validated by quantitative industry data.From here, characteristics of the criticality scales can be determined. Each characteristic should then be weighted using a scale from 0 to 10 to identify significance to the business. The greater the scale, the easier it will be to accurately identify &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; assets. However, the total score possible should not exceed 100. By setting a limit of 100, you are reinforcing the &amp;ldquo;weight&amp;rdquo; of each characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/d245cfd5-1011-4943-877c-50753a2691cd_Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 0px; width: 647px; height: 286px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="margin-left: -22.5pt;"&gt;
	Figure 6. Criticality Analysis Data Table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establishing an equipment criticality will allow us to determine the priority to which risk ranking can be applied. A risk table or some other risk analysis method can be used to then perform risk analysis. The quantitative risk assessment and the risk assessment matrix are two widely accepted methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quantitative risk assessmentuses failure rate data to develop meantime between failure probabilities for specific asset types or classes. There are software companies that will sell you accelerators or tables for generic asset types, much like those tables used by companies that sell life insurance. But just as in dealing with health, the data does not directly correlate to a specific facility or industry, nor does it take into account the specific operational envelope of the equipment. Further analysis is required, much like that of the physical exam required prior to receiving coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another option is to develop this data in-house. Although extremely tedious, it is possible to collect this data. Best practice work order processes and their execution, along with reliability analytics, are required to collect relevant historical data. With proper historical data available, this method may be used for risk assessment. If proper historical data is not available, you need an experienced professional to help you perform a quantitative risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another common practice is to apply a risk assessment matrix to the asset catalog to determine the severity and occurrence of failure. By highlighting the assets that pose the highest risk, the matrix also helps guide decision-making on how corporate resources will be applied to improve safety or lessen the uncontrolled release of environmental or health hazards. This also adds significant value early on in the application design review of a capital project involving a new plant, new processes or changes to existing processes. Figure 7 provides a simple, visual method to determine at what point additional controls should be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The risk assessment uses risk severity and likelihood of occurrence to provide a grading matrix. From the combination of severity and occurrence, a risk level can then be defined as high, medium or low. This risk level is then used in combination with the criticality analysis to create a risk ranking.&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/9062915b-0b0c-4700-8f98-54d274b58abd_Figure 7.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 551px; height: 267px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	Figure 7. Risk Assessment Matrix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This risk ranking is then used to define what level of failure analysis will be performed. Reliability-centered maintenance is a proven and very meticulous method to answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the functions and associated desired standards of performance of the asset in its present operating context? (Functions)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In what ways can it fail to fulfill its functions? (Functional Failures)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What causes each functional failure? (Failure Modes)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What happens when each failure occurs? (Failure Effects)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In what way does each failure matter? (Failure Consequences)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What should be done to predict or prevent each failure? (Proactive Tasks and Task Intervals)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What should be done if a suitable proactive task cannot be found? (Default Action)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to resource constraints, it is not possible to perform this level of analysis for each asset within the master data file. Therefore, risk ranking can be used to determine the analysis to be put in place to provide the most cost-effective deterrent or detection method for managing our assets. An example of an appropriate distribution and application of risk ranking appears below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/386ecdac-4e67-4770-b96a-7e30e985ef30_Figure 8.jpeg " style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 309px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 1in;"&gt;
	Figure 8. Distribution and Application of Risk Ranking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Control strategies include preventive tasks, predictive tasks, remote monitoring, condition monitoring, operating procedures, rebuild, replace, redesign criteria, operator care and critical spares, to name a few. All should be documented in standard work procedures and define the risk and failure that they are mitigating. Once the predominant failure modes are identified, we can then define the control strategy to eliminate or mitigate that failure to reduce the risk. Examples include time-based inspections to take core samples for chlorides of insulated carbon-steel piping or process intelligence used in a process line to trend asset health. For all control strategies it is important that the processes are mapped and the interfaces are identified. More and more data is available every day, and a system can quickly be overwhelmed without clearly defining requirements and supporting management of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/b9e9d3d4-0bbd-41b4-a71c-d0ecabb18aea_Figure 9.jpeg " style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 210px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 9. Control Strategy Development Process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When mapping our control solution, we must take into account all the required operational integration of our management information systems. This helps ensure that we are leveraging the intelligence accurately. It also helps us understand the possible vulnerability of this data to lack of a management of change process to ensure integrity of the configuration and the data. Now more than ever, our reliability and operations professionals must join with our information technology professionals to ensure the linkages of our data entry, storage and reporting are consistent and well-defined, from pumps and compressors to programmable logic controllers, to the distributed control system, to our process intelligence, then to our enterprise asset management system and finally all the way up to the general ledgers and balance sheets managed within our enterprise resource planning application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider that each time we purchase a vibration monitor, install a sophisticated piece of equipment, invest in a best-in-breed enterprise asset management system or purchase software to manage our mechanical integrity program, we add another layer that must be modeled or integrated into our asset management system. A significant value in the EAM software is the ability to create catalogs based on asset type. As in Figure 10, asset catalogs identify common attributes, failure types, cause codes and task lists that will allow a work order to be created for breakdowns that will adequately capture the valuable equipment history that we need in our relentless pursuit of continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/62d446bc-ac44-44d6-81b5-6a7bdf248211_Figure 10.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 647px; height: 370px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 10. Example of an Asset Catalog&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Once the management information system is configured to capture the information necessary to develop the appropriate queries and reporting needed, we have the means to effectively identify our opportunities. The metrics we use as part of our performance monitoring should closely tie to our strategic plan and corporate objectives. Work order history is a key source of our measurement activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at work orders that are generated due to breakdowns. If the hierarchy allows drill down to sufficient detail to link the maintainable asset to a set of failure codes that an operator can easily distinguish and are specific to the asset type, we can measure conditions that are related to the failure. Next, we need a way to measure the financial impact of the failure on our marketing plan. Given a rate of value the asset contributes and the lost availability, we can measure the lost market opportunity. Another consideration is the cost to complete the repair. The labor, material and contract support expended make up the additional cost of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	By using the time stamps in our management information system, we can also accurately capture the meantime between failure and the meantime to repair, which are two of the most meaningful reliability indicators. Another key consideration is in closing the work order and capturing the information obtained by the maintenance and reliability professional doing the work. Some level of root cause will be performed to identify why the failure occurred, and this should be coded specifically to the asset type. This cause code will allow us to understand what contributed to the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/9/28/4d8e4c60-18a6-4dd6-b10a-e43ca7c0fe4e_Figure 11.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 491px; height: 492px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	Figure 11. System Performance Curve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work orders used to perform preventive tasks require several components to facilitate review. The tasks that are being performed on the asset must be specific to the asset type and clearly define what failure mode the task is identifying, mitigating or eliminating. The costs associated with these tasks should appropriately reflect the preventive activities and create a method to link to corrective work generated from these tasks. The first item allows us to compare and trend the cost of preventive activities to that of corrective activities. The second item allows us to capture the corrective work generated from preventive activities. Both these items provide a method to measure the effectiveness of the control strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final and most important element of the preventive tasks is to have specified parameters, defined thresholds and the requirement to collect data that can be trended to determine the health of the asset. This provides the two-way communication in the control strategy and moves the task from static to dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why Implement a Risk-based Asset Management Strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fundamentally, in a risk-based asset management system, you collect relevant information based on importance to the value stream and use this information to make fiscally responsible decisions that will in turn create greater value to the organization. The four phases in the risk-based asset management model are critical for the success of this strategy. When you couple this strategy with business processes that support best practice, seamlessly integrated to leverage critical information to make decisions and supported by a corporate culture driven to the relentless pursuit of continuous improvement, you can achieve results like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Personnel have recognized the value of continuous improvement and have demonstrated their belief with their actions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Limiting factors have been identified and reduced by orders of magnitudes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Substantial capital investments have been avoided by improving capacity and availability.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Significant reduction in cost of products sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These benefits result in significantly improved operational stability along with substantial financial improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Improve Communication within Your Organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The communication blitz is a proven approach to communicating key messages effectively throughout an organization. Individuals looking to improve communication within their organization and enhance employee engagement can adopt the easy-to-use process introduced in this article.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	During a large project, when many things are changing, there is an increased need for ongoing communication to all employees. When implementing a continuous-improvement initiative, effectively communicating the changes is essential to success. Change management during a big project is just that &amp;mdash; managing the change itself. The communication blitz provides proactive messages to help manage the change within an organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A large project like an implementation of reliability excellence requires a master plan that includes major tasks and milestones, and a well-designed change-management plan. The change-management plan needs to include a comprehensive communication plan. The communication blitz, a subset of the communication plan, is a series of communications delivered face to face from the leaders who sponsor the change all the way to the hourly employees working at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Prepare to Follow the Sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The approach is simple. First, senior leaders develop a succinct, short message. They then divide up the front-line supervisors into equal groups. The leaders go out into the work areas of the supervisors, discuss this message, seek open discussion and check for retention with the supervisors. This can be done individually or in small groups.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Next, the supervisors meet with their employees in small groups and deliver the same message. After a short period of time, usually around two to four weeks, the leadership group interviews a sample of the hourly employees to determine if they can explain the message. They develop questions specific to the message delivered so that there is a standard approach to talking with the hourly employees. The goal is to have 40 percent retention, meaning that 40 percent of the employees can clearly articulate the message. After attaining 40 percent or better, the next message can be developed, and the cycle begins again. See Illustration 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/dc31566a-a2bd-418f-889f-7506ed36817b_illustration 1a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 532px; height: 435px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forty percent is the minimum number of people who should have a strong understanding of the messages to make sure the communications are getting through. This dramatically improves the likelihood of the changes taking hold. When scoring the retention, it is a good idea to develop a matrix of the key questions and the list of employees who received the message. See Illustration 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/b9f92761-27cb-4dd4-8aba-990316740845_illustration 2a.jpeg" style="width: 648px; height: 284px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to document how well the employees have retained the message. Talking to a few people to get a gut check is too subjective to make sure the message was well received. Using this simple matrix helps to make sure that the desired outcome has in fact occurred. When actually scoring the retention, three levels of response should be expected &amp;ndash; full recall, some recall or no recall. Two people are usually involved in conducting the review &amp;mdash; the top site manager and the project leader. This typically requires two 2-hour sessions, carrying a clipboard with the questions and any additional information that you would like to leave with each person interviewed.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	From this example, we can analyze how well the message has been retained and communicated back during the evaluation. Reviewing this scorecard example (the totals per person down the right side and then totals per question across the bottom) reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the results. Reviewing the scores of the people indicates the &amp;ldquo;operator&amp;rdquo; has low understanding. Further review with other operators should be conducted to determine if it was a single person that missed the content or if all operators were missing the main points. The totals across the bottom illustrate that discussing &amp;ldquo;How long will this change take?&amp;rdquo; had the lowest score. It was not clearly communicated and needs to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every round of the blitz has to have a judgment call regarding the need for a partial or whole message to be repeated. In this case, repeating the details around &amp;ldquo;How long will this change take?&amp;rdquo; is necessary, but the rest of the message in round two can be new content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to avoid a common mistake with organizational communications &amp;mdash; measuring the success of a communication from the sender&amp;rsquo;s point of view. Leaders frequently feel that &amp;ldquo;we told them&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;we have communicated this with a town-hall meeting, sent e-mails and put out posters regarding this message, they must know what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&amp;rdquo; In fact, they are assuming the employees got the message because of their high confidence in the development of the message and channels selected to deliver it. There are always opportunities to improve the effective delivery of a message, yet the only way to avoid assumptions of retention is to monitor retention with the receiver. See Illustration 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/0188dd05-c395-422b-b8b3-ec5a90d49667_illustration 3a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 648px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The effectiveness of a communication should always be monitored by conducting face-to-face evaluations with the hourly employees, seeking to understand how much can be recalled. This has multiple positive effects. Site leaders are seen out in the work areas, leaders are following up on the message illustrating the importance, employees feel valued when they are asked these questions by top leadership, supervisors feel valued by having direct face-to-face time with the top leaders and the top leaders end up learning things about the employees and supervisors from their time together.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The cost to perform a communication blitz is the leadership&amp;rsquo;s time. It is much more efficient to send an e-mail and expect the employees to get the message. The most efficient approach is also typically the least effective. The investment in time is well worth the return. How many times has a big change been rolled out with minimal training and poor communication? When only the efficient methods are used, the results are usually meager at best.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Another important concept is that the communication blitz is intended to be a series of messages, not just one round. When the leaders are out checking the retention of the second and third messages, different employees should be approached. For each round that this is performed, a new message and subsequent questions need to be developed.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Including the top site leader during retention checks sends a significant message about the importance of the project at hand. When the hourly employees are approached by the top manager and the project manager, they get a clear message about the importance of the change and how they need to make sure to engage any information coming out about this project going forward.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Patricia Landry was leading the manufacturing excellence implementation at the Noranda Alumina processing plant in Gramercy, La., over the last couple years. Here&amp;rsquo;s how she reflects on her experience using the communication blitz approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How important is it to focus on clear, concise communications during a big project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is the No. 1 aspect that a management team must do to implement a change. Depending on the change, once employees understand the nature and the reasons behind the change, they typically will be more accepting of the project/change.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How would you rank the ability of the leadership team to communicate with employees before this approach was used? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The management team here at Noranda Alumina would be the first to admit that communication is not our strong suit. The communication blitz offered us an organized way of communicating to our 400(+) employees.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What was it like developing the first communication blitz?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Developing our first blitz taught us to focus on our audience. We understood the specifics of the project and did not need to communicate that in detail. We needed to let them know the basics and how it was going to affect them. We learned to keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How long did it take to roll out the message to all employees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The blitz was designed to take a month to communicate to everyone that we needed to reach. It actually took us a couple of weeks longer.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How did you get the leadership team to divide up and go out to speak with the supervisors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We split the plant into segments, and each person volunteered for the areas that they wanted to be responsible for.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Did supervisors embrace or resist the communication effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	They embraced it.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Did hourly employees embrace or resist the communication effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t describe their reaction as embrace or resist but more of a &amp;ldquo;wait and see&amp;rdquo; attitude. It sounds good, but they are skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What kind of feedback did you get during the message-evaluation step?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It was positive. Most people had to be prompted. Once they were reminded of what manufacturing excellence was, they remembered the communication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What did you learn from the whole process of developing, rolling out and auditing the effectiveness of the first communication blitz? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We learned that we have to remember our audience. The follow-up is also very important. What employees understand and what you intend to communicate can be two different things.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do you foresee this blitz approach playing a role in your communications going forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Yes, the manufacturing excellence steering team intends to continue communicating using the blitz method. It was even suggested as a communication tool corporate-wide at a leadership conference in September last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improving communications within an organization is not as difficult as many leaders may believe. Adopting the communication blitz process can bolster your change management strategies and improve both employee engagement and the sustainability of the changes at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Identifying Risks Through Asset Management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Findings from recent catastrophic events, such as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, have revealed that information relating to asset health was readily available but not properly managed. Analysis of the Gulf of Mexico event indicated that there were conditions in critical assets that could have impaired performance prior to and after the accident. A routine testing and maintenance program should have detected these conditions. This is an easy statement to make after a catastrophic event occurs. What is much more difficult is to navigate the overwhelming number of specifications and standards available to corporations on management systems and develop an asset management model that provides the transparency to asset health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step is developing a management system standard that adequately addresses six key elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Policy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implementation and operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Performance assessment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improvement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Management review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This (and all other standards and specifications relating to management systems) follows the plan-do-check-act methodology of continuous improvement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now think of all the management systems we have relating to our business &amp;mdash; quality management systems, asset management systems, performance or production management systems, environmental, health and safety management systems. We need to integrate these systems to ensure common elements are leveraged to manage the requirements and the data that provide us the transparency we require in risk identification and decision-making.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 1 illustrates the common requirements, such as information and information technology. Proper integration of these standards yields the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved business focus&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Holistic approach to managing business risk&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less conflict between systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction in duplication and bureaucracy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Effective and efficient internal and external audits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/60e62cee-7cea-4ab5-8e3b-1952ef67b004_Risk Figure 1a.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 1px; width: 648px; height: 274px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next step is to have a risk-based asset management system in place like that depicted in Figure 2. This management system, like the others, follows the plan-do-check-act methodology. Following this methodology is critically important. When accidents occur, like the one in the Gulf, it&amp;rsquo;s often because the management systems addressed the &amp;ldquo;plan,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;check,&amp;rdquo; but lacked the &amp;ldquo;act.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/bd8784bb-5a00-4600-b275-de54ff495211_Risk Figure 2a.jpeg" style="margin: 1px 2px; width: 648px; height: 363px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Risk-based Asset Management System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the shortcomings of management systems is a key common element &amp;mdash; information management. Once we appropriately classify our assets to determine those critical to our value stream, we then perform the analysis and develop the control strategy to mitigate or eliminate risk. These control strategies are requirements, and executing these control strategies generates data. Here lies the most important point to this discussion. The investigation report from the Gulf accident stated that a routine testing and maintenance program should have detected these conditions. This is not a simple statement. The information contained in the data that is generated from these requirements is collected and stored in numerous locations on various IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 3 illustrates the complexity of management information at a refinery. The boundary of the Purdue Reference Model (shaded in gray) is that information relevant to asset management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/d264606d-2b57-4e81-a523-ec97bce45c92_Risk Figure 3a.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 2px; width: 648px; height: 449px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Enterprise-control System Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We need to ensure that we have identified how the data generated from our control strategy will be integrated to determine asset health and provide the transparency needed to identify, mitigate and eliminate risk. Figure 4 is an example of an asset management information system model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/5fca547f-352a-4d0c-a9c9-78bd3ac5aebc_Risk Figure 4a.jpeg" style="margin: 7px 2px; width: 648px; height: 358px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Asset Management Information Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this model, it is clear that until we map the criteria to the condition, integrate the information and provide it in a portal or dashboard, we will not have an accurate indication of asset health and therefore will remain at risk. As technology advances, there are new and innovative ways to perform these functions. However, until we address these significant gaps, we will continue to have the information we need but not use it to create value.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Monitoring the Performance of Your Asset Management System</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	All reliability-centered continuous improvement programs must include both a process that effectively assesses the condition of the plant&amp;rsquo;s capital assets and a monitoring process. The British Standard Institution&amp;rsquo;s Publically Available Specification (PAS-55) states, &amp;ldquo;The organization shall establish, implement and maintain process(es) and/or procedure(s) to monitor and measure the performance of the asset management system and the performance and/or condition of assets and/or asset systems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The specification indicates your Asset Management System (AMS) must address both reactive and proactive monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A reactive monitoring process identifies past or existing nonconformities in the asset management system as well as any asset-related deterioration, failures or incidents. This sounds straightforward, but how do you cost effectively monitor or measure nonconformities in either the management system or physical assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A comprehensive AMS includes how the corporation&amp;rsquo;s physical assets are procured, commissioned, operated, maintained and disposed of.&amp;nbsp; It consists of &lt;em&gt;standard processes and procedures &lt;/em&gt;that govern production scheduling, operations and maintenance of these assets. If you only have one asset, this is relatively simple, but how do you effectively monitor compliance to standards across the enterprise for all assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most cost-effective way to monitor compliance of the processes and procedures used across the enterprise is to design or re-engineer the processes with performance monitoring in mind.&amp;nbsp; An often made mistake in performance monitoring is the deployment of technology and the technically skilled people to manage it with little or no consideration of the processes or metrics used to drive performance.&amp;nbsp; An alternative and less than ideal approach is to create processes that periodically audit or sample the processes, procedures and practices that are being used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Proactive Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proactive monitoring seeks assurance that the physical assets and the AMS are operating as intended. In reality, this requirement is the same as reactive monitoring. The only difference is timing. It&amp;rsquo;s like the difference between Root Cause Analysis and Root Cause Failure Analysis. Both are analytical tools that resolve real or potential problems. The difference is when you perform the analysis. If you perform it after the failure or incident, it is reactive. If you perform it before the failure, it&amp;rsquo;s proactive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Again, the best solution is to build monitoring and analyses into the &lt;em&gt;standard work processes and procedures&lt;/em&gt; that are used to perform all tasks or activities that directly or indirectly affect asset performance and reliability. This is done through key performance indicators designed to measure true leading and lagging indicators of asset performance and condition, as well as the work processes or procedures used to plan, schedule, operate and maintain them. This will only work with true indicators. For example, preventive maintenance compliance is only valid as a leading indicator when the right tasks are performed, at the right time and on the right asset.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it might in fact be non-value added work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Leading and Lagging Indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An AMS that depends on &lt;em&gt;lagging indicators &lt;/em&gt;is by definition reactive. To be proactive and effective, the AMS must also include &lt;em&gt;leading indicators&lt;/em&gt; that foretell non-conformance or deficiencies that can be expected at some point in the future. The mistake that too many companies make is limiting their AMS indicators to maintenance or failure-centric deficiencies. They limit their focus to things such as preventive maintenance compliance, wrench time and maintenance planning effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; While maintenance and failure or breakdown performance is important, much more must be considered and monitored for the AMS to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a minimum, the leading and lagging indicators must include all of the performance indicators that define the operating effectiveness and efficiency of assets, both physical and human.&amp;nbsp; Indicators such as labor hours per unit, cost of goods sold, energy usage per unit, etc., are effective leading and lagging indicators that provide the means to manage assets effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The obstacle we must first overcome is how to monitor and evaluate the performance and condition of critical assets and the massive volume of data that must be acquired, manipulated, interpreted and finally converted into actionable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many have tried to create autonomous systems &amp;mdash; some manual and some computerized &amp;mdash; to extract the raw data from the myriad of data systems throughout the enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Even the few who have managed to fully integrate their enterprise information management system and have automated most of the process still need the data interpreted and corrective actions determined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once structured performance monitoring is in place, the financial opportunities that lie within your asset management system will become apparent, and mitigating and eliminating these limiting factors will lead to real performance and continuous improvement. The result is greater asset utilization and a higher return on net assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>YRC Worldwide Launches Initiatives to Reduce Emissions, Cut Costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	YRC Worldwide announced several sustainability initiatives, including low-viscosity engine oil, trailer skirts, and optimizing its network.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;!stop&gt;This month, YRC Worldwide begins its shift to 5W full-synthetic motor oil, which will improve the fuel efficiency of the company&amp;#39;s fleet and reduce waste motor oil.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;When fully implemented in 2012, this change will translate to an annual savings of approximately 100,000 gallons of fuel,&amp;quot; said Mike Kelley, chief sustainability officer and vice president, external affairs. &amp;quot;In addition, this will reduce the waste oil we dispose of each year by approximately 28,000 fewer gallons.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company also is adding wind skirts to its 53-foot trailers, which will reduce drag to improve fuel economy. Concentrating initially on equipment in California, YRC Worldwide will extend the use of wind skirts nationwide. YRC Worldwide introduced its use of fuel-efficient tires in early 2010. Additionally, the company will order an initial SmartWay-certified power unit to use in a pilot program this summer.&lt;br /&gt;
	YRC Worldwide will also be hiring additional network engineers in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Network engineers are skilled in finding ways to optimize our network to minimize empty miles and maximize trailer capacity,&amp;quot; Kelley said. &amp;quot;Our network design works in tandem with our fleet enhancements, driving further reductions in emissions.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The efforts at becoming greener and more efficient are intended to help return the beleaguered company to profitability. Last quarter, the $4.3 billion company posted a $102 million loss. The company also plans to complete a financial restructuring this summer.&lt;/!stop&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/HgCaj8VZVuA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New Conveyor Lubricant Released by Ecolab</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ecolab Inc. recently introduced DryExx&amp;reg; GF, a new conveyor lubricant specifically designed for use with glass bottles on steel conveyor belts. According to Ecolab, DryExx GF saves up to 80 percent of the water used when compared to traditional wet lubricants but still achieves the highest possible hygiene levels and does not compromise efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DryExx GF formula contains an active lubricating substance which creates a protective film on the belts. This results in reduced friction, less abrasion and consequently eliminates the need to use large amounts of water to continually wash any abrasion off the belts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The introduction of DryExx GF once again demonstrates Ecolab&amp;#39;s leadership in the field of innovative conveyor lubrication technologies and our focus on helping our customers run more sustainable operations,&amp;quot; said Andreas Weilinghoff, general manager of Ecolab Food &amp;amp; Beverage in Europe. &amp;quot;The use of dry lubricants combines the highest possible water savings with hygienic and efficient technology - all cornerstone features of Ecolab&amp;#39;s products within this industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With sales of $6 billion and more than 26,000 associates, Ecolab Inc. (NYSE: ECL) is the global leader in cleaning, sanitizing, food safety and infection prevention products and services. Ecolab delivers comprehensive programs and services to foodservice, food and beverage processing, healthcare, and hospitality markets in more than 160 countries.

            <title>Expanded Lubrication Oil Monitoring for Gas Compressors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Boston, MA &amp;ndash; Protecting their large hydrogen screw compressors while assuring refinery uptime, the largest US Gulf Coast refiner is adding in-line lube &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" size="3"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" size="3"&gt;oil viscometers &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;to all their new and existing units. The sensors will be used to provide real-time continuous monitoring of the compressor bearing lubrication fluid throughout equipment operations. A lead engineer at this facility says, &amp;quot;Despite using separators, the lubricant can become diluted by gas carry-over or contamination. If left unchecked, this can cause problems, especially during subsequent start-ups.&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity President Robert Kasameyer says that &amp;quot;when the compressor is running, the lubrication oil is hot and the entrained gas remains in gaseous phase. When the compressor is down, the lubrication oil cools and some of this gas can become liquid, which causes the lube oil viscosity to drop. Then, when the equipment is re-started but before it heats up, the equipment is operating with inadequate lubrication, which can be a disaster! If it makes it through this stage, the light hydrocarbons will again become gaseous, separating out of the lube oil, and the lube oil will regain its proper viscosity. But the damage will already be done.&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;The refinery is centralizing the viscosity sensor outputs with easy-to-access and use displays tied to the overall plant information system. The refinery uses centralized monitoring stations, each of which receives instantaneous information. One is currently tracking four viscometers while another connects with ten individual sensors on different gas compressors. This saves lab and technician time, as well as potential damage to the equipment itself. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman, times, serif"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;About Cambridge Viscosity&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity, the leader in small sample viscometry, provides automated viscometers for advanced laboratory and production viscometer systems worldwide. Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s global reach is important for providing application engineering support and service wherever and whenever needed &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity sets the standard for precise, reliable and low maintenance viscosity measurement and control systems. Patented oscillating piston technology ensures accurate, true results across a broad range of lab and in-line applications, including refining and petrochemicals, oil and gas, coatings, paints and inks, pharmaceuticals and other substances. Cambridge Viscosity&amp;#39;s sensors and viscometer systems conform to ASTM, DIN, JIS and ISO standards, with a range of models designed to meet specific industry and application needs. Certifications include ATEX, CE, and FM. CSA certification is available upon request.

            <title>Abanaki Releases New Edition of Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CLEVELAND, OH--(Marketwire - April 12, 2011) - Abanaki Corporation, the world leader in oil skimming and coolant maintenance products, announces the new updated edition of its Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook for solving oil removal problems.&amp;nbsp;The new handbook offers expanded information about oil skimming principles, applications, technologies, installation tips, and how to select and size an &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234940&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fskimsel.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In addition, this complete oil skimming guide shows comparative skimmer types as well as turnkey systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An electronic version of Abanaki&amp;#39;s Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook is a handy resource for environmental engineers, plant maintenance personnel, wastewater treatment engineers, manufacturing engineers and related professionals looking for a solution to their oil contamination problems.&amp;nbsp;A complimentary copy of the new Oil Skimmer Facts Handbook may be downloaded from Abanaki&amp;#39;s website at &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234943&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2f157"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;http://www.abanaki.com/157&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil skimming is the most economical, low-maintenance method for removing floating oil, grease, fuel and other hydrocarbons from water. As the oil skimmer belt or tube passes through water, the contaminants are attracted to the media and carried to wiper blades where the oil is removed.&amp;nbsp;Oil skimming uses the differences in specific gravity and surface tension between oil and water to pick up oil, grease and other hydrocarbons. Companies use Abanaki &lt;a href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=742124&amp;amp;id=234946&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.abanaki.com%2fmodel8.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;oil skimmers&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a wide range of applications from meeting EPA and municipal pollution standards to improving coolant quality in machine tool operations.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Husqvarna Turning to Lean Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The world&amp;rsquo;s largest producer of lawn mowers, power tools and trimmer, Husqvarna,&amp;nbsp;knows a thing or two about cutting and pruning. When it came time for a more efficient approach to production at Husqvarna &amp;ndash; in this case, trimming production time at its plant in Beatrice, Neb. &amp;ndash; the company turned to Lean Manufacturing experts Rucker &amp;amp; Associates for impressive results. So impressive that Husqvarna recently invited Rucker to share its Lean manufacturing efficiency measures at the company&amp;rsquo;s largest U.S. site in Orangeburg, S.C.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In recent years, growing customer demand necessitated improved efficiencies at Husqvarna&amp;rsquo;s Beatrice plant for the company to expand production. Implementing Lean Six Sigma strategies helped Husqvarna increase production capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to David Rucker, the Beatrice production line features multiple equipment models, each requiring unique assembly methods and different amounts of dedicated assembly time from the operators. Using Lean principles to balance production flow, Rucker&amp;rsquo;s team created a more visual and flexible assembly line, delivering only the next two hours&amp;rsquo; worth of raw materials. Rucker is president of Rucker &amp;amp; Associates whose team specializes in finding industrial and operational efficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;By changing the way operators worked on the line, we were able to make it easier for Husqvarna to accomplish more, increasing the overall efficiency,&amp;rdquo; Rucker said. &amp;ldquo;These types of changes make a huge difference in all aspects of the business, from reduced labor costs to on-time delivery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Orangeburg site is next in line. According to Rucker, it provides a greater challenge simply because of the size of the plant, at&amp;nbsp;1 million square feet.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have been thrilled to improve Husqvarna processes in Beatrice,&amp;rdquo; Rucker said. &amp;ldquo;We believe we can achieve similar results at the cornerstone of their U.S. presence in Orangeburg.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Raleigh, N.C., Rucker &amp;amp; Associates is a high-performance consultancy dedicated to helping companies discover dramatic new efficiencies using Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma improvement methodologies. Rucker&amp;rsquo;s hands-on mentoring process with clients produces dramatic results &amp;ndash; training teams to accelerate change and implement continuous improvement. Every Rucker project features an unconditional guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Husqvarna Group is the world&amp;#39;s largest producer of outdoor power products including chainsaws, trimmers, lawn mowers and garden tractors. It is the European leader in consumer irrigation equipment under the Gardena brand. The Group is also one of the world leaders in cutting equipment and diamond tools for the construction and stone industries. Net sales in 2009 were SEK 34 billion and the average number of employees was 15,000 in 42 countries.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Stainless steel hoist available for clean rooms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Lab-Lift&amp;trade; all-stainless steel strap hoist is specifically engineered for demanding pharmaceutical manufacturing use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The David Round Company has announced an all-stainless steel strap hoist specifically engineered for demanding pharmaceutical manufacturing use. The new Lab-Lift&amp;trade; product represents an advancement in clean room material handling equipment design to further minimize the potential for contamination.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Lab-Lift product features a highly polished finish and a urethane-coated lubrication-&lt;wbr&gt;free lifting strap, which eliminates the particulate contamination associated with chain hoists or wire rope hoists. There is no metal-on-metal abrasion to potentially create particle contaminates. The hoist mechanism is enclosed in a smooth-sided polished 304 stainless steel enclosure for easy wash-down. The enclosure slides away to allow easy cleaning of internal components. A wiper seal for the strap helps isolate the hoist&amp;rsquo;s internal mechanism from the clean room environment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Construction is all-stainless steel, including motors and motor brakes. Gearing is sealed, with food grade lubrication. Welds are smooth-ground, faces are flush-mounted and fasteners are plugged to further reduce potential contamination. Load hook and latch are stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are pleased to introduce the first clean room hoist designed from the ground up for lifting in the pharmaceutical environment,&amp;rdquo;&lt;wbr&gt; said Brad Young, president of David Round. &amp;ldquo;For a number of years, we have recognized the special requirements of pharma by manufacturing all-stainless steel material and handling products featuring paint-free construction. This new line of hoists builds on this experience, but adds a streamlined completely crack-and-crevice free exterior.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Eight out of ten of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers have David Round stainless hoists in their newest facilities, according to the manufacturer. Many drug makers now mandate all-stainless steel external construction, refusing any painted surfaces, even those with FDA-approved epoxies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	David Round products can be found in almost every industry from pharmaceutical processing and food manufacturing to oil and gas, aviation, pulp and paper and water control, and help improve handling system efficiency while making the workplace a more productive and safer environment through their ergonomic designs.&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The David Round Company is located at 10200 Wellman Road, Streetsboro, OH 44241.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ashless extreme pressure additive offered for greases</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	By Thomas J. Karol, Ph.D. and Ronald J. Tepper, Ph. D. (Senior Chemist), &lt;a class="sm1" href="mailto:SDonnelly@rtvanderbilt.com"&gt;Steven G. Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; (Manager of Technical Services)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The R.T. Vanderbilt Company is commercially offering a new ashless extreme pressure (EP) additive (VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972) for greases and certain glycol fluids.&amp;nbsp; The material is a proprietary additive with patent pending. Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 is aimed at being environmentally friendly with cost effectiveness equivalent to the heavy metal EP additives in use today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The new additive is a &amp;quot;readily&amp;quot; biodegradable liquid material that affords high Timken pass values and four ball weld results with 1.5 to 2% additive treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Theory of Thiadiazoles as EP additives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Thiadiazole dimer technology (VANLUBE 829) has been used successfully in grease, which requires high load carrying properties as measured by the Four-Ball EP Test (ASTM 2596). The weld point reported in this test is the lowest applied load at which the sliding steel-on-steel surfaces seize and then weld. Most greases weld at between 126 kgf to 160 kgf while grease treated with 2.0 mass percent VANLUBE 829 will reach 250 kgf and sometimes 315 kgf; at 3.0 mass percent a 620 kgf weld point is possible. On occasion, we have been able to obtain the maximum 800 kgf loading without seizure.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We believe a possible explanation of why this additive can sustain such high loads and prevent steel-on-steel seizure is the ability to complex to the metal surface. Thiadiazole monomer technology (VANLUBE 871) is an effective antiwear additive in motor oils but doesn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate the EP properties of the dimer technology. This suggests that the dimer technology affords a &amp;quot;bidentate coordination&amp;quot; (meaning &amp;quot;two teeth&amp;quot;) on the metal surface. The fact that the mono thiadiazoles afford only wear protection, supports the &amp;quot;bidentate coordination&amp;quot; as a reasonable explanation of the improved metal coordination that would be necessary for high load (or EP) protection. We believe that the pseudo aromatic nature of the ring allows &lt;font face="Symbol"&gt;p&lt;/font&gt; -complexation with the metal surface. The following structure depicts our visualization of how the ring could orientate planar to the metal and affect a double complexation or bidentate effect. In this light either ring&amp;rsquo;s decomplexation with the metal surface, does not eliminate the material from the metal surface.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Next Generation Thiadiazole Technology (thiadiazole dimer bridging)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The R.T. VANDERBILT research group set about to improve the ability of the thiadiazole technology to coordinate with metal surface thereby improving EP properties:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obtain a liquid product&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase the Timken OK load (versus VANLUBE 829)&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain good 4 ball EP test performance&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obtain an environmentally friendly product (ashless, biodegradable)&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cost effective versus metal technology&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our new grease technology &lt;b&gt;(Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972)&lt;/b&gt; consists of a complex between the 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMTD) disulfide dimer and butoxytriglycol and obtains all of these above goals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972: Thiadiazole / Glycol Complex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The pure disulfide dimer of DMTD (VANLUBE 829) shows excellent four ball weld properties. However, the product is a solid material with relatively low Timken values. We have recently found that the complex between the solid material and butoxytriglycol is an easily handled liquid with excellent Timken and 4-Ball Wear values and has been found to be biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It is believed that the improved extreme pressure properties are due to coordination between the thiadiazole bis dimer and butoxytriglycol which affords a bridging capable of many thiadiazole rings interacting with the surface but still linked by the glycol interaction between dimers. This affords a polydentate (versus a bidentate of the simple dimer) surface interaction. The butoxytriglycol bis DMTD derivative multiple association has a maximized surface interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Physical Evidence of Bridging dimer Thiadiazole Technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Performance is the most compelling evidence. The liquid complex Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 can obtain 80-pound Timken with 400 kgf 4-ball EP at very low levels (1-2%). To obtain this with metal technology took about 5%. If you were to evaluate the individual components of the dimer thiadiazole-glycol complex, the glycol has essentially no EP performance while the dimer thiadiazole performs exceptionally only in the 4-ball-EP test (not the Timken). The complex at the minimized treatment level (1-2%) which still obtains the maximum OK Timken Load result (80 pound Timken possible) produces a 4-ball EP test result of 315-400 kgf (typical). It is clear that this concentration level (thiadiazole is about 40% of VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972) of dimer thiadiazole (without the glycol bridge) would produce lower 4-ball-EP test results (VANLUBE 829 @ 0.5% in a Lithium grease gave 215 kgf 4-ball EP test) and a very low Timken result (~ 20-30 pound).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The maximum load carrying performance of VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 is at least an 80 pound Timken (maximum attempted due to variability in test) and a 400 kgf 4-ball EP test (although reached at 1-2%, evaluated to 5%).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Major shifts in IR absorption peaks&lt;/b&gt; are further evidence for the complex formation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="4"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;font color="#e1995f" face="arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1499, 1472, 1447, 1382, 1268, 1232, 1112 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;Triethylene glycol monobutyl ether&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1460, 1351, 1297, 1248&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;

				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;Complex, disulfide bis-dimer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1510, 1433, 1350, 1244&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional evidence of true complexation of glycols to dimer thiadiazoles is shown by the interaction with the glycol as measured by simple solubility. Dimer thiadiazoles have little interaction with most solvents as seen by their saturation point in that solvent. Higher interactions would be seen by more solvation, which would be evident by higher levels dissolving (again higher interaction). The solvolysis/complexation is evidence of this higher interaction. We believe that the glycol must have the ability to coordinate with two dimer molecules to function a chain link in the complex and afford the EP properties.&lt;br /&gt;

	Formation of the complex frequently requires heating to approximately 130&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;C. Stirring indefinitely at room temperature will not dissolve the solid thiadiazole derivative in the glycol.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Copper to Gold&lt;/b&gt; color changes (1a- 2e) occur on copper strip. This is the &amp;quot;typical thiadiazole coating&amp;quot; with the vast majority of 1,3,4-thiadiazole analogs. Air exposed copper (versus &amp;quot;freshly polished&amp;quot;) demonstrates a 1a color. Thiadiazole exposed copper demonstrates a gold color metal would be rated 2e. Test were conducted to determine if this color change was a protective coat or corrosion of the copper metal.&lt;br /&gt;

	Results indicate that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 does not corrode copper but coats the metal with a film. Most of the film can be removed with acetone and a paper towel. Acetone is highly polar and coordinates well with the metal sites and still some thiadiazole coordination remains.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We wished to test if this coating was &amp;quot;protective&amp;quot; to corrosion by treating the copper with lubricant with copper corrosive additive alone and compare that to the corrosive additive with the Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 thiadiazole present.&lt;br /&gt;

	Results indicate that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 protects against copper corrosion. Molybdenum dithiophosphate shows a weight loss with a high degree of darkening (4a). Molybdenum dithiophosphate shows no corrosion with VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 as seen by a weight gain and the characteristic gold color (2e) formed.&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Improving Wear Scar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most EP additives do have some effect on the wear scar of the lubricant. Since they have a high metal interaction, one might expect some degree of &amp;quot;corrosive&amp;quot; effect on the metal. This could explain the higher wear scar seen in a grease treated with Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 (versus the base grease) in the Shell 4-ball wear test.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In a second aluminum complex grease, it was found that the Timken properties, 4-Ball Wear properties, and the 4-Ball Weld properties are improved in the presence of the rust inhibitor, OD-9316 (&lt;font face="Times"&gt;USP 5,599,779&lt;/font&gt;; material available from R.T. VANDERBILT Co).&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;br /&gt;
	One standard test method for determining aerobic biodegradation of lubricants and their components is the Gledhill Shake flask ASTM method D-6139-97. This test method was used for evaluating the biodegradation of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972. Doses of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 were subjected to the conditions of the test, and there appeared to be a dose-related response. The percent degradation was measured by the amount of carbon dioxide produced versus the theoretical amount. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; that formed was determined by reaction of carbon dioxide with barium hydroxide, which forms barium carbonate as the product:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;nbsp;appears that the higher levels of glycol diminish the bacterial activity. This would be expected from the biodegradation of the glycol itself where it is stated &amp;quot;biodegradable in low levels&amp;quot;. The biodegradation of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 was compared with the percent biodegradation of sodium benzoate and canola oil, which are known to have very high biodegradation and are typically used as standards. We were very delighted that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 (at low levels) is &amp;quot;readily&amp;quot; biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Automotive industry pursuing new technology, techniques</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MarketResearch.com has announced the addition of GBI Research&amp;#39;s new report &amp;quot;Lubricants Industry to 2015 - Surge in Automotive Market in Emerging Economies Driving Demand,&amp;quot; to their collection of Chemicals market reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the report, the global automotive industry is back on the growth path after the setback caused by the financial crisis of 2009. The industry is now actively pursuing innovative new technologies, production and business techniques. Although it is on a growth path, the fact remains that it will take a long time for it to recover, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asia has recovered well as compared to the West, and this is reflected in the growing automobile numbers. China, the world&amp;#39;s largest automotive market, showed a more than 20% growth in December 2010. China and India seem to have weathered the financial crisis storm, compensating for the decline in lubricant demand in the rest of the world. In 2009, these countries took over the automotive production leadership position, with over 14 million units -- a surge of more than 48% over 2008 -- and well over 10 million more than the total production of the US, Canada, and Mexico combined. In India, the production growth was less dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;!--portletbreak--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report scope includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overview of lubricant Industry, Refining and Blending and Formulation of Lubricant and various classifications of the lubricant such as general classification based on Additives and based on Application.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global lubricant Industry demand and Market Size forecast to 2015&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Key trends and Challenges in the industry , Global Motor Vehicle outlook and Industry outlook and how they are affecting the lubricant Industry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global lubricant demand by Region including key regions such as Asia-Pacific, Europe, Americas and Middle East and Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global lubricant demand to 2015 by formulation such as synthetic, vegetable, re-refined and hydrocarbon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global lubricant demand by market to 2015 by automotive, industrial and metalworking fluids/Grease.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Key strategies used by various companies to compete in the global market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Major players and SWOT analysis of companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, PetroChina, Sinopec, Chevron and OAO Lukoil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Ceramic bearings designed for the food processing industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings has introduced&amp;nbsp;its new and expanded line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and specialty lubricates specifically designed for the food processing and food packaging industries. Some of the most pressing issues facing the food manufacturing industry today are controlling costs and food safety. Full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings are capable of alleviating some of these concerns. Ceramic balls are far more efficient than steel balls because the rolling surface is more spherically perfect and therefore reduces friction. Companies that converted to ceramic bearings have seen a decrease of energy consumption and were therefore able to cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ceramic in ball form is twice the Rockwell hardness of steel which results in a more durable and longer lasting bearing. Boca Bearings line of full ceramic and ceramic hybrid bearings are appropriate for use in food packaging and food processing due to their ability to work in challenging conditions. Ceramic materials can operate in extreme temperatures, work with heavy loads and will not corrode or rust when exposed to water, alkali or acids, as might be customary during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings also offers a line of traditional lubrication, solid lubrication and dry lubrication that are FDA approved for food manufacturing facilities. For example Boca&amp;rsquo;s exclusive Ultra Dry Lube (UDL) is an extensively modified Lamellar composition that adds less than half a micron to any metal substrate. UDL molecularly bonds to most materials and is inorganic, non-toxic, non-corrosive and resistant to most fuels, solvents and acids present in food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further Boca Bearings offers the Lightning Solid Lube (LSL) line of solid Polyethylene and Graphite lubricants. LSL Poly lube, available in food grade and non food grade, is excellent for continuous operating temperatures up to 93&amp;deg;C (200&amp;deg;F) that can drastically increase bearing life and eliminate dripping oil or grease. LSL Graphite lube can be used in extreme operating temperatures from -157&amp;deg;C (-250 &amp;deg;F) to 349&amp;deg;C (660&amp;deg;F); Graphite Lube is insoluble in most organic solutions and will not wash out in water, steam or chemical wash down procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ASQ World Conference focuses on new role of quality</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The new role of quality: Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s applications of proven quality tools &lt;/em&gt;is the theme of &lt;a href="http://wcqi.asq.org/index.html" jquery1295446118259="93" target="_blank"&gt;ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2011 World Conference on Quality and Improvement&lt;/a&gt;, May 16-18, 2011, in Pittsburgh. Conference registration is available &lt;a href="http://wcqi.asq.org/register.html" jquery1295446118259="94" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The conference content seeks to re-examine the role that quality can play in the face of today&amp;rsquo;s challenges. It also provides an array of networking opportunities and further education on the latest industry trends, as well as insight into how quality makes a global impact. This year&amp;rsquo;s conference includes three keynote speakers whose work reflects the shifting role of quality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adm. Thad Allen, USCG (Ret.)&amp;mdash;Monday, May 16, 7:45 a.m. &amp;ndash; 9:45 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Adm. Thad Allen was selected by President Barack Obama on May 1, 2010, to serve as the National Incident Commander (NIC) for the unified response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He held that position concurrently while finishing his tenure as the commandant of the Coast Guard. In this position, Allen was charged with oversight efforts to cease the flow of oil and mitigate the effects of the worst oil disaster in U.S. history. Working closely with other federal officials and organizations, he sought to bring a global unity of effort to response endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to his efforts in the Gulf, Allen also was involved in response efforts to the September 2001 terrorist attacks and was designated the principal federal official for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Allen officially retired from active duty service June 30, 2010, after 39 years of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J.J. Irani, Tata Steel&amp;mdash;Tuesday, May 17, 8:00 a.m. &amp;ndash; 9:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In 1968 J.J. Irani joined The Tata Iron and Steel Company Ltd. (TISCO), now Tata Steel with headquarters in India, as assistant to the director of research and development. He went on to hold the positions of general superintendent, general manager, president and managing director. After holding the CEO&amp;rsquo;s office for almost a decade, he retired as managing director of Tata Steel in 2001. Presently, he continues to be a director on the board of Tata Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1997, Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him an honorary knighthood (KBE) for his contributions to Indo-British trade and cooperation. In 2007 he was honored by the president of India who conferred on him the award of &amp;quot;Padma Bhushan&amp;quot; for his services to trade and industry in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbara Corcoran, The Corcoran Group&amp;mdash;Tuesday, May 17, 1:15 p.m. &amp;ndash; 2:15 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Barbara Corcoran&amp;rsquo;s credentials include straight Ds in high school and college and 20 jobs by the time she turned 23. It was her next job that would make her one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country when she took a $1,000 loan to start The Corcoran Group. She parlayed the loan into a $5 billion real estate business and sold it in 2001 for $70 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corcoran is the real estate contributor for NBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;quot;Today&amp;quot; show where she comments weekly on trends in the real estate market. She&amp;rsquo;s also an investor/shark on ABC&amp;rsquo;s reality hit &amp;quot;Shark Tank.&amp;quot; Corcoran is the author of &lt;em&gt;Use What You&amp;rsquo;ve Got&lt;/em&gt;, an entertaining business book that has become a national best-seller, as well as &lt;em&gt;Nextville, Amazing Places to Live Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. Her latest book, &lt;em&gt;Shark Tales&lt;/em&gt;, is due out in January 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Topic Sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to the keynote speakers, the conference is comprised of more than 100 sessions. They focus on five different areas: global, risk management, building a quality culture, organizational excellence and quality basics. Sessions will cover topics critical to a variety of industries including traditional manufacturing, healthcare, government, financial services and many more. Sessions are tailored for those new to quality to those seasoned in the quality profession, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Building/Maintaining a Culture to Support Quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Social Responsibility Performance Improvement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global Quality Culture Alignment Starts Where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Food Safety Standards: Past, Present and Future&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solving Supply Chain Problems Proactively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Conferences for the Price of One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once again, attendees are able to attend four other &amp;quot;mini-conferences&amp;quot; that will be held concurrently with the ASQ World Conference, all for one registration fee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

            <title>Apply lean principles to training and learning</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Did you know that most training and learning programs are 85&amp;nbsp;to 99 percent&amp;nbsp;waste? Hard to believe, but it&amp;#39;s true. Just like in manufacturing, lean principles can be effectively applied to them and eliminate streamline activities, reduce costs and improve quality. In this video, Todd Hudson talks about how the classic wastes of &amp;quot;overproduction&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;delay&amp;quot; apply to training and learning and how to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Learn from the best: Baldrige recipients showcased at Quest conference</title>
            <description>&lt;div class="cs-wrapper-center-col"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Cherry blossoms won&amp;#39;t be the only things flowering in Washington, D.C., during the first week in April. Quality, innovation and performance excellence will be in full bloom at the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/qe/index.cfm" id="CP___PAGEID=1518986,index.cfm,299|"&gt;23rd annual Quest for Excellence Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Registration is now open at &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/nist-exit-script.cfm?url=https://secure.asq.org/conferences/quest-for-excellence/2011/registration.html"&gt;https://secure.asq.org/conferences/quest-for-excellence/2011/registration.html&lt;/a&gt; for the April 4-6, 2011, event that will showcase the best practices and lessons learned of the seven 2010 Baldrige Award recipient organizations along with those from past awardees as well.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The conference will kick off with an in-depth plenary featuring the senior executives of the 2010 recipients, followed by 60 concurrent sessions from which to choose. In these sessions, current or past Baldrige Award recipients will present their proven strategies and real-world insights on:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			improving an organization&amp;#39;s performance results, including product outcomes, student learning results and health care outcomes;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			enhancing leadership effectiveness;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			building customer and employee engagement;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

            <title>Kanbans link the supply chain together</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Single-piece continuous flow is the most effective and cost-efficient way to produce or process anything. It is what lean is all about. However, we also realize this is not always possible. There are steps within the process that run at dissimilar speeds. If the process steps or equipment speeds cannot be synchronized or changed, we need to inject a buffer inventory into the systems so as to simulate single piece continuous flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanbans are signals which automate the replenishment of&amp;nbsp;repetitively used materials and supplies from internal or external suppliers to the buffer inventories. Kanbans reduce outages and shortages of materials and supplies, which improves customer service levels. Kanbans support &amp;ldquo;pull production&amp;rdquo; and continuous flow, since material is not produced at the supplier until a signal to replenish material is received from the customer. Using this approach, kanbans will reduce overall inventory levels (30 percent reduction on average).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanbans can be used anywhere in the organization where there is repetitive usage including: maintenance supplies, janitorial supplies, raw materials, office supplies,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;br /&gt;
	The type of signal used in a kanban is only limited by your imagination, but there must be agreement on the type of signal and the information it contains between the supplier and the customer. (In general, all kanban development is accomplished by negotiation, at least&amp;nbsp;for the first few kanbans, between the supplier and customer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note that kanbans are the most efficient at eliminating waste when the signals are returned from the point of use (customer) to the supplier. Sending the signal back through purchasing so they can cut another purchase order to the suppler is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a kanban system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All signals must contain the information that the supplier needs to replenish the material. The following information is typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/efc2fd3c-1d63-4591-8a0a-d4a2eb6b6061_rubrich1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Note the above &amp;ldquo;number of containers&amp;rdquo; also means the &amp;ldquo;number of&amp;nbsp;kanban signals.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other information that might be included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Previous operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time/date of delivery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Where used (in what model number)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storage area (the goal is to have suppliers&amp;nbsp;deliver to the point of use)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The empty container is sent back to the supplier for refilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	On the way to delivering this material to the production line, the material handler stops at a conveniently placed fax machine and faxes the kanban card back to the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Office Engineering Plotter Kanbans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As plotter supplies are used (ink cartridges and paper), the faxable sheets are sent to the supplier (the engineers send the signals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/c6497e2e-c654-44ad-a89a-aafceeb49b95_rubrich5.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. Internet Kanban&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The internet kanban allows an external supplier to monitor in real time the inventory levels of a raw material that is stored in a bulk storage tank. The weight of the material is converted by a&amp;nbsp;load cell&amp;nbsp;into a fill level. The supplier then decides when to give themselves an order to produce more material, and when to ship it so the customer does not run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/1/5/quick/066817cc-a91c-4d8b-a606-78e8c8cc0e89_rubrich6.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. Shipping Trailer Kanban&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When&amp;nbsp;material usage is very high, the material is only unloaded from the trailer as&amp;nbsp;it is used. In this case the supplier has two full trailers on site. When the first trailer is emptied, the signal is sent, and the second trailer is backed up to the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When kanbans are developed&amp;nbsp;through negotiation with both your internal and external suppliers, the outcome will be a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tom Peters' views on innovation and benchmarking</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Tom Peters first captured the attention of global business leaders with his 1982 book, &amp;quot;In Search of Excellence.&amp;quot; By examining the characteristics shared by successful companies, he created a guide for managers keen to drive their organizations to greater heights.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A series of subsequent books served to hone Peters&amp;#39; thinking and provided the launching pad for his successful consulting company. He now spends much of his time traveling the world, advising senior managers on the steps they need to take to ensure their company&amp;#39;s long-term survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to Peters, future economic success will spring from entrepreneurial individuals and small firms agile enough to seize new opportunities. Freed from the constraints of top-heavy management structures, they will generate the ideas and innovations needed to survive in an ultra-competitive world.&lt;/p&gt;

	Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing plant has been named one of the 10 best plants in North America by &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=IndustryWeek+in+the+magazine%27s+annual+competition.&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=dc40e623c18abcf0772e5d1095810046" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek &lt;/i&gt;in the magazine&amp;rsquo;s annual competition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, a panel of the magazine&amp;rsquo;s editors and outside experts recognize North American facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction and create stimulating and rewarding work environments. This year, Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s plant, which manufactures Avery brand office products, stood out from other entries with consistently high quality, rigorous maintenance and safety results, and especially its use of Enterprise Lean Sigma (ELS) to create efficiencies, improve productivity and increase customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Tijuana is a model of a continuously learning organization,&amp;quot; said Greg Temple, Avery Dennison vice president, global operations and Enterprise Lean Sigma. &amp;quot;They have overcome significant business challenges over the years through a relentless focus on waste and process discipline, and &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#39;s recognition is very gratifying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among its accomplishments, the Office Products plant has operated with 98 percent &amp;ldquo;first-pass&amp;rdquo; yield of products; achieved nearly $6 million in documented improvement projects in 2009; and gained a total of 310,000 square feet over the last five years through ELS initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The review panel also noted that one of the plant&amp;rsquo;s outstanding characteristics is the depth of employee engagement. &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; noted the high number of employee suggestions and cited the example of production worker Azucena Robles, who proposed using a compressed air gun at a strategic point on the assembly line for Avery Glue Stics to keep the line moving while label applicators are refilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Everyone in the Tijuana plant, from the plant leadership team to the operators on the shop floor, is using creative problem-solving skills,&amp;rdquo; said Tim Bond, group vice president, Avery Dennison Office Products. &amp;ldquo;One of their products is continuous improvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; will honor the Tijuana team during a ceremony this April in Atlanta, Ga., and will feature the facility in its January issue, which is available &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=online+now&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=1eb77d1f417484f7b770f4180ca9d9a0" target="_blank"&gt;online now&lt;/a&gt;. The competition is in its 21st year and previous recent winners include Raytheon, Philips and Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Background on Honeywell's Baldrige Award-winning business</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What made Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp;amp; Technologies LLC worthy of winning the Baldrige Award. Here is a synopsis from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Type of Work:&lt;/strong&gt; Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp;amp; Technologies LLC (FM&amp;amp;T) is a management and operating contractor at the National Nuclear Security Administration&amp;rsquo;s Kansas City Plant contract. The facilities under management are multi-disciplinary engineering and manufacturing operations specializing in electrical, mechanical, and engineered material components. They are one of the nation&amp;rsquo;s most diverse low-volume, high reliability production facilities serving government agencies, national laboratories, universities, and U.S. industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Web Site:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/nist-exit-script.cfm?url=http://www.honeywell.com/sites/kcp/index.jsp"&gt;http://www.honeywell.com/sites/kcp/index.jsp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Revenues:&lt;/strong&gt; $540 million operating budget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Workforce:&lt;/strong&gt; 2,704 (1,088 salaried and 896 hourly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Locations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kansas City Plant (Kansas City, Mo.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kirtland Operations: Six locations on or around Kirtland AFB (Albuquerque, N.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Satellite Office at Los Alamos National Laboratory Facility (Los Alamos, N.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ft. Chaffee Facility (Barling, Ark.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Overall customer satisfaction has been maintained at or above 95 percent for the past four years. This level compares favorably to commercial best-in-class, whose levels range from 78 percent to 85 percent for the same period. The percentage of customers willing to continue work with FM&amp;amp;T is measured by quarter, and this has been maintained at 96 percent for the past four quarters. This level compares favorably with a commercial (private) best in class level of 95 percent for the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s governance system is the Management Assurance System used for identifying, implementing, measuring, and sustaining the &amp;ldquo;critical to quality&amp;rdquo; needs necessary for desired performance. The system is also the basis for deployment of FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s purpose, vision, mission, and values.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Customer product quality and reliability performance is segmented by traditional and non-traditional customers. The combined quality/reliability performance level has been at 99.9 percent for traditional customers for the past three years. The level for non-traditional customers has been trending upwards since fiscal year 2006 from roughly 98.4 percent to 99 percent in fiscal year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Through the Enterprise Alignment Process, the daily accountability of the salaried and hourly workforce is aligned to the FM&amp;amp;T balanced scorecard and strategic plan. These processes contribute to satisfaction scores of 72 percent for &amp;ldquo;workforce feels appreciated&amp;rdquo; compared to commercial best in class manufacturers of 67 percent, a score of 81 percent for &amp;ldquo;management listens to ideas&amp;rdquo; compared to 76 percent, a score of 72 percent for &amp;ldquo;positive environment&amp;rdquo; compared to 58 percent, and a score of 80 percent for &amp;ldquo;information provided&amp;rdquo; compared to 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;rsquo;s senior leader open door policy and information sharing are two of its leadership strengths. Quarterly meetings are held to share the state of the business and respond to employee questions and concerns. &amp;ldquo;Skip level&amp;rdquo; meetings and e-mail boxes such as &amp;ldquo;Ask FM&amp;amp;T President&amp;rdquo; provide avenues for employees to have direct access to senior leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s use of the Six Sigma Plus Continuous Improvement Model ensures integration of customer and business requirements into all design projects. Use of this approach has resulted in cost savings from increased productivity and deployed innovations of between $23.5 million and $27 million annually for the past three fiscal years.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FM&amp;amp;T demonstrates good citizenship through employee-giving programs, such as Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the FM&amp;amp;T Employees Club, and the Christmas in October and Harvesters food collections. Employee volunteer hours donated averaged roughly 15,000 hours per year from 2006 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>EnerNOC energy management applications deployed in lean manufacturing study</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	EnerNOC Inc., a leading provider of energy management applications for the smart grid, announced December 17 that it is partnering with a Virginia Tech research group to monitor energy usage data across multiple sites in an innovative study of &amp;quot;lean&amp;quot; manufacturing strategies. The Wood Innovation Research Group will use EnerNOC&amp;#39;s web-based energy management applications to gather energy usage data from three Virginia wood product manufacturers and analyze trends in energy usage to identify opportunities for improved efficiency. Merrillat, Ten Oaks Flooring Company and Morgan Lumber will contribute data to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Uniquely, this project explores integrating energy efficiency into &amp;quot;lean&amp;quot; manufacturing techniques, which are followed by leading manufacturers world-wide. Traditionally, lean thinking has been focused on reducing seven forms of waste, including transport, inventory and defects, among others. This application of EnerNOC&amp;#39;s technology aims to reveal how manufacturers can identify waste in energy use and minimize its impact on the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Since many manufacturing facilities are extremely complex, even &amp;#39;lean&amp;#39; manufacturers tend to miss the resources they waste through inefficient energy use,&amp;quot; said Dr. Henry Quesada-Pineda, assistant professor of business and manufacturing processes at Virginia Tech, who will lead the research project. &amp;quot;To advise these manufacturers, our research group required a robust data processing and analysis platform to identify wasteful energy usage across an array of sites. EnerNOC&amp;#39;s energy profiling functionality allows us to see the broader energy-use picture, as well as drill down into facility-specific usage data to inform our project.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;For many businesses, energy is an &amp;#39;unseen&amp;#39; form of waste. The results are only clear after the bill arrives each month,&amp;quot; said Gregg Dixon, EnerNOC&amp;#39;s senior vice president of marketing. &amp;quot;EnerNOC&amp;#39;s data-driven energy efficiency applications are designed to be flexible and extensible enough to serve all kinds of commercial, institutional and industrial businesses, as well as to support the research that will move the field of energy efficiency forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EnerNOC&amp;#39;s energy management applications, DemandSMART, EfficiencySMART, SupplySMART and CarbonSMART, empower users with access to real-time energy usage data. All DemandSMART comprehensive demand response customers receive basic energy profiling functionality at no cost. For more in-depth analysis, EfficiencySMART Commissioning and EfficiencySMART Insight offer further real-time visibility into energy usage and costs at a single site or across a portfolio of facilities, enabling the ability to rapidly identify and harvest a range of low and no-cost energy savings opportunities previously hidden from view, reduce energy spikes and related demand charges, optimize energy efficiency investments and strategy and enhance measurement and verification of ongoing and future energy efficiency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About EnerNOC &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	EnerNOC unlocks the full value of energy management for our utility and commercial, institutional and industrial (C&amp;amp;I) customers by reducing real-time demand for electricity, increasing energy efficiency, improving energy supply transparency in competitive markets and mitigating emissions. We accomplish this by delivering world-class energy management applications including DemandSMART, comprehensive demand response; EfficiencySMART, data-driven energy efficiency; SupplySMART, energy price and risk management; and CarbonSMART, enterprise carbon management.

            <title>A very good primer on Six Sigma principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is Six Sigma? It&amp;#39;s a systematic way to solve problems involving defects and deviation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You only need a handful of tools to solve most problems:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Control charts of current performance (and to monitor performance after improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Pareto charts (for defects) and histograms (for variation)&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Ishikawa - Fishbone diagrams for root cause analysis&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Baldrige program needs the best of the best as examiners</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Provide a valuable service to your country. If you&amp;#39;re an expert from a business, education, healthcare or non-profit organization, and possess knowledge and experience in leadership, strategic planning, customer service, human resources, process management and achieving results, you are on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Most Wanted List.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program is seeking exceptional individuals to serve on the 2011 Board of Examiners for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Examiners evaluate applications for the Award and prepare feedback reports to applicants that cite strengths and opportunities for improvement. They also act as &amp;quot;ambassadors&amp;quot; for the Baldrige Program and performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application form for the 2011 Board of Examiners is now available online at &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm" jquery1292340340147="106"&gt;www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. Applications must be submitted electronically by 5 p.m. EST on Jan. 13, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The board consists of more than 500 volunteers, including 12 judges and about 60 senior examiners representing many industries and sectors. Service on the board provides opportunities to enhance one&amp;#39;s knowledge about improving processes and achieving world-class results, develop a network of like-minded colleagues, and help improve U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the most valuable benefit to being an examiner: comprehensive training from one of the top 10 government leadership development programs as named by Leadership Excellence magazine for three years in a row. This professional development also can qualify for Continuing Education Units (CEUs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For assistance in preparing an examiner application, contact &lt;a href="mailto:examappl@nist.gov" jquery1292340340147="107"&gt;examappl@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call the Examiner Hotline toll-free at 877-237-9064 (Option 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 and is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in cooperation with the private sector. The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance management strategies. The Baldrige Award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/l552V4tzZcU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>First set of Baldrige Award criteria for 2011-2012 now online</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program has announced that the 2011-2012 Criteria for Performance Excellence for businesses and nonprofit organizations are now available for &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/business_nonprofit_criteria.cfm" jquery1292340203317="106"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. The Criteria serve both as the standard for selecting the annual recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and the road map for organizations worldwide seeking improved strategy and operations through pursuing performance excellence. The other two editions of the 2011-2012 Criteria&amp;mdash;for health care and education&amp;mdash;will be available on the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/index.cfm" jquery1292340203317="107"&gt;Baldrige website&lt;/a&gt; later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Criteria work as an integrated framework for managing an organization. They are simply a set of questions focusing on seven critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce focus; operations focus; and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;rsquo;s revisions to the Business/Nonprofit Criteria emphasized two themes: dealing with the increasing complexity of enterprise leadership and management; and improving customer engagement. The Criteria now include the concept of &amp;ldquo;intelligent risk taking&amp;rdquo; and an improved &amp;ldquo;line of sight&amp;rdquo; set of linkages that should take an organization from the strategic environment to the execution of its operations in a logical sequence. The category on customer focus has been reorganized to improve the flow of logic and now addresses the use of social media as an important contributor to capturing the &amp;ldquo;voice of the customer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness and performance of U.S. businesses. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige program is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Paper copies of the Criteria will be mailed on request. E-mail &lt;a href="mailto:baldrige@nist.gov" jquery1292340203317="108"&gt;baldrige@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call 301-975-2036.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/6Y0YJv0NMAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dr. Deming explains the '5 Deadly Diseases' of management</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	In 1984, Dr. W. Edwards&amp;nbsp;Deming foresaw the current economic crisis and the cause. Take a look at this video and you will learn of the &amp;quot;5 Deadly Diseases&amp;quot; that are at the heart of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Dr. Deming said, &amp;quot;A Transformation must take place in American industry or it will continue on the decline until the style of American management changes ... and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Ninety-eight percent don&amp;#39;t know there is a problem or there is anything they can do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Food for thought: Avoid tunnel vision in the plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I was being driven around a particular site by an engineer recently when I noticed an anomaly. Something just didn&amp;rsquo;t look right with a cable tray mounted to a pipe rack. It appeared the cable tray was sagging and had broken loose from its mounting. I asked the engineer if he noticed it and he said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;. So, I asked him to turn around and make another pass. Sure enough, the tray had broken loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often times, we become complacent in our surroundings and we simply don&amp;rsquo;t notice things that are changing all around us. It&amp;rsquo;s like we are wearing blinders, suffering from tunnel vision. We only look straight ahead or, worse, hang our head down when we move through the site in our travels. I bet you would really be surprised at the number of people that never look up at the ceiling. Are you one of those, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I&amp;rsquo;m at a site, I&amp;rsquo;m looking everywhere because it&amp;rsquo;s all new to me. Make your site &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; to you, too. Take the time to look up at the ceiling, at pipe supports, and to the side. Make an effort to find things that are not in their place or not normal. From a maintenance and reliability perspective, we want to inspect to find things in the act of failing and repair them from a proactive point of view before the failure occurs. Separately, 5-S is a great process to find things out of place, but what about chains rubbing on guards or, worse, rubbing through conduits? What about hydraulic and other fluid leaks? I can assure you that you would never believe some of the things I have seen people walk by every day at sites and never notice &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp;things that kill equipment reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m more conditioned to this approach as I had a manager (read mentor) who used to take me on walks throughout the site (inside and out) looking for items in need of repair or just sprucing up before a VIP tour. We looked for the simplest things like missing conduit covers, lights out or water on the floor. Why? Because finding and fixing the little things helped to ensure they didn&amp;rsquo;t become bigger and more costly things later &amp;ndash; like a slip and fall from the water on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When was the last time you walked the floor with your people looking for the littlest things to improve? Sure, we all have bigger fish to fry, like planned work activities. But don&amp;rsquo;t you see, this is another way to create a culture of continuous improvement. Open their eyes and create an expectation that even the little things matter. Strive to be the best. Make it a contest with your group to see how many &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; things they can find on your walks &amp;hellip; and then, fix them. See if you can find even more on the next walk two weeks later. Repeat that again in two weeks. Notice that you are starting to create a trend here, a &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; of continuous improvement and setting an expectation? So, what are you waiting for? Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What are some techniques like this that you use to drive continuous improvement?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>First set of Baldrige criteria for 2011-2012 now available online</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program has announced that the 2011-2012 Criteria for Performance Excellence for businesses and non-profit organizations are now available for &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/business_nonprofit_criteria.cfm"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. The criteria serve both as the standard for selecting the annual recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and the road map for organizations worldwide seeking improved strategy and operations through pursuing performance excellence. The other two editions of the 2011-2012 criteria &amp;ndash; for health care and education &amp;ndash; will be available on the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/index.cfm"&gt;Baldrige Web site&lt;/a&gt; later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Criteria work as an integrated framework for managing an organization. They are simply a set of questions focusing on seven critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce focus; operations focus; and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;rsquo;s revisions to the Business/Nonprofit Criteria emphasized two themes: dealing with the increasing complexity of enterprise leadership and management; and improving customer engagement. The criteria now include the concept of &amp;ldquo;intelligent risk taking&amp;rdquo; and an improved &amp;ldquo;line of sight&amp;rdquo; set of linkages that should take an organization from the strategic environment to the execution of its operations in a logical sequence. The category on customer focus has been reorganized to improve the flow of logic and now addresses the use of social media as an important contributor to capturing the &amp;ldquo;voice of the customer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness and performance of U.S. businesses. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige program is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Paper copies of the criteria will be mailed on request. E-mail &lt;a href="mailto:baldrige@nist.gov"&gt;baldrige@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call 301-975-2036.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/TfTIF5-JuJQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Baldrige program needs best of the best as examiners</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Provide a valuable service to your country. If you&amp;#39;re an expert from a business, education, healthcare or nonprofit organization, and possess knowledge and experience in leadership, strategic planning, customer service, human resources, process management and achieving results, you are on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Most Wanted List.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program is seeking exceptional individuals to serve on the 2011 Board of Examiners for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Examiners evaluate applications for the Award and prepare feedback reports to applicants that cite strengths and opportunities for improvement. They also act as &amp;quot;ambassadors&amp;quot; for the Baldrige Program and performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application form for the 2011 Board of Examiners is now &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm"&gt;www.nist.gov/baldrige/examiners/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;. Applications must be submitted electronically by 5 p.m. EST on January 13, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The board consists of more than 500 volunteers, including 12 judges and about 60 senior examiners representing many industries and sectors. Service on the board provides opportunities to enhance one&amp;#39;s knowledge about improving processes and achieving world-class results, develop a network of like-minded colleagues, and help improve U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps the most valuable benefit to being an examiner: comprehensive training from one of the top 10 government leadership development programs as named by Leadership Excellence magazine for three years in a row. This professional development also can qualify for Continuing Education Units (CEUs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For assistance in preparing an examiner application, contact &lt;a href="mailto:examappl@nist.gov"&gt;examappl@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt; or call the Examiner Hotline toll-free at 877-237-9064 (Option 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 and is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in cooperation with the private sector. The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance management strategies. The Baldrige Award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 86 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/RGhNo3bZbvk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ASQ fighting to keep Baldrige program alive</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The American Society for Quality has stepped in to help the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to save the program. The U.S. National Commission for Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (NCFRR) was formed several months ago to make recommendations for ways to reduce the nation&amp;rsquo;s debt.&amp;nbsp;One of the government programs on the chopping block is the Baldrige program. ASQ is working along with the Baldrige Foundation, The Alliance (the state programs), and others who have supported this valuable program over the years to let the commissioners know that the Baldrige program is not simply an award program. The commission is due to vote on the co-chairs&amp;rsquo; recommendations on December 1.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	This presentation is from a 1994 event hosted by Clare Crawford-Mason and Lloyd Dobyns to capture the learning and legacy of Dr. W. Edwards Deming. Russ knew Dr. Deming and speaks here about the difference between &amp;quot;continuous improvement&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;discontinuous improvement&amp;quot; as seen through the lens of systems thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Seven U.S. organizations win 2010 Baldrige National Quality Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on November 23 named seven organizations as recipients of the 2010 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the nation&amp;#39;s highest presidential honor for performance excellence through innovation, improvement and visionary leadership. This marks the first year that three small businesses have been selected at one time and only the second instance in the award&amp;#39;s 23-year history that a total of seven organizations are being honored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 Baldrige Award recipients &amp;ndash; listed with their category &amp;ndash; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/medrad_profile.cfm"&gt;MEDRAD, Warrendale, Pa. (manufacturing)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/purina_profile.cfm"&gt;Nestl&amp;eacute; Purina PetCare Co., St. Louis, Mo. (manufacturing)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/freese-nichols_profile.cfm"&gt;Freese and Nichols Inc., Fort Worth, Texas (small business)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/k-n-management_profile.cfm"&gt;K&amp;amp;N Management, Austin, Texas (small business)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/studer-group_profile.cfm"&gt;Studer Group, Gulf Breeze, Fla. (small business)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/good-samaritan_profile.cfm"&gt;Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, Downers Grove, Ill. (health care)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/award_recipients/mcps_profile.cfm"&gt;Montgomery County Public Schools, Rockville, Md. (education)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	MEDRAD receives the Baldrige Award for the second time, having also been selected in the manufacturing category in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Today we honor the country&amp;#39;s most innovative organizations and the people who make them great,&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Locke said. &amp;quot;This year&amp;#39;s recipients of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award embody the ingenuity and creativity that characterizes the American spirit and drives America forward. Innovation is at the heart of U.S. job creation, competitiveness and global strength, and the accomplishments of these outstanding leaders are an inspiration to us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This award is unique in that it honors the collective effort of an entire organization that has systematically strived to achieve excellence in all aspects of its work. Today&amp;#39;s honorees demonstrate how teamwork and a shared vision can lead not only to organizational success but also to nationwide advancements in innovation and economic competitiveness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 Baldrige Award recipients were selected from a field of 83 applicants. All of the applicants were evaluated rigorously by an independent board of examiners in seven areas: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis and knowledge management; workforce focus; process management; and results. The evaluation process for each of the recipients included about 1,000 hours of review and an on-site visit by a team of examiners to clarify questions and verify information in the applications. The 2010 Baldrige Award recipients are expected to be presented with their awards at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness and performance of U.S. businesses. Originally, three types of organizations were eligible: manufacturers, service companies and small businesses. Congress expanded the program in 1999 to include education and health care organizations, and again in 2007 to include nonprofit organizations such as charities, trade and professional associations, and government agencies. The award promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance strategies. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 87 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program is managed by the Commerce Department&amp;#39;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the private sector. The program raises awareness about the importance of performance excellence in driving the U.S. and global economy; provides organizational assessment tools and criteria; educates leaders in businesses, schools, health care organizations, and government and nonprofit agencies about the practices of best-in-class organizations; and recognizes national role models by honoring them with the only Presidential Award for performance excellence.

&lt;p&gt;
	As a nonregulatory agency of the Commerce Department, NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/2R_QALCGDc4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>MEDRAD wins Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for second time</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD Inc., a business of Bayer HealthCare, on November 23 joined an elite group of only five companies that have received the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD, a market leader in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and interventional cardiology, learned November 23 that it will receive a 2010 Baldrige Award for excellence in manufacturing &amp;ndash; an honor that it first received in 2003. The Baldrige Award is the top honor a U.S. company can achieve for performance excellence, and is traditionally presented by the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over 80 organizations applied for the award this year. MEDRAD was chosen to receive the award following a rigorous site visit and review process from Baldrige examiners. During the site visit, eight examiners interviewed more than 700 of MEDRAD&amp;#39;s U.S. and global employees and reviewed over 5,000 pages of documentation, in order to confirm the business practices described in MEDRAD&amp;#39;s application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after a former secretary of commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. business by recognizing role model companies for business achievements and successful performance strategies. Today, it is an internationally recognized award for excellence in business and other organizations, and serves as the foundation for quality and performance excellence awards in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD president and CEO Sam Liang said, &amp;quot;I could not be more proud of our employees. They have continued to deliver for our customers in spite of a tough economy, and are committed to continuously improving what we do, and how we do it. This award belongs to them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD&amp;#39;s 2010 award accomplishment represents years of value gained through the use of Baldrige criteria, which the company began to incorporate into its business in the &amp;#39;90s. Today, the criteria are a key input into what MEDRAD refers to as &amp;quot;Performance Excellence,&amp;quot; or the relentless pursuit of continuous improvement that will exceed the expectations of customers, shareholders and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At MEDRAD, the company&amp;#39;s more than 2000 employees are aligned on three key aspects of the Performance Excellence mind-set, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unchanging core values that align the entire organization on delivering results for customers, employees and shareholders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Constant adaptability to changing needs that ensures continued success&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Focus on innovation, which drives growth by improving the quality of healthcare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These three aspects of Performance Excellence permeate every facet of MEDRAD&amp;#39;s business. They are values that each employee embraces and utilizes in their role at the company. By collectively working to understand and demonstrate these values, MEDRAD employees effectively practice Performance Excellence every day. This cross-company alignment is demonstrated by 2010 survey results that reveal 84 percent of MEDRAD employees feel that they understand how their work contributes to the company&amp;#39;s goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD&amp;#39;s dedication to excellence has enabled it to maintain a superior brand reputation and healthy sales performance in all product segments including vascular injection and diagnostic imaging accessory segments. Fueling this success is a single-minded commitment to customers, evidenced through survey data that indicates nearly 96 percent of MEDRAD&amp;#39;s global customers are likely to recommend MEDRAD to a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in conjunction with the private sector. As a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NIST develops and promotes measurement, standards and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade and improve the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other organizations that have received the award include: Federal Express, Motorola, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, 3M Dental Products Division and two divisions of Boeing. Four other organizations have been two-time recipients of the Baldrige Award: Solectron Corporation, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company (now part of Marriott International), Texas Nameplate Company Inc., and Sunny Fresh Foods Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About MEDRAD Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	MEDRAD Inc. develops, markets and services medical devices used to diagnose and treat disease. Its product offerings include fluid injection systems for radiology and cardiology, endovascular devices for the safe treatment of cardiovascular disease, magnetic resonance-compatible accessories and equipment services. The company&amp;#39;s world headquarters is near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the United States. MEDRAD is a business of Bayer HealthCare.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Association for Manufacturing Excellence (AME) announced the six recipients of its 2010 Manufacturing Excellence Award.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The awards, presented on November 18 at AME&amp;rsquo;s 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference, signify high levels of excellence achieved and sustained during the past year.

            <title>Toyota initiative creates new uses for company's technologies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Sales (TMS) USA Inc. on November 8 announced its new brand campaign, &amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good,&amp;rdquo; a unique initiative centered on what the company has been doing for many years &amp;ndash; repurposing its innovative automotive technology to benefit society in the non-automotive space. The campaign builds upon Toyota&amp;rsquo;s DNA of quality, reliability and durability, as well as its commitment to innovation, by inviting consumers to share their own ideas to improve quality of life beyond the automotive world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An extension of Toyota&amp;rsquo;s enduring commitment towards continuous improvement, the &amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good&amp;rdquo; initiative empowers people to imagine new possibilities for Toyota technologies. Beginning today, the public is invited to share ideas on how to repurpose Toyota technology through the &amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good&amp;rdquo; program sponsored by Toyota. Consumers are challenged to find new, non-automotive applications for five distinct Toyota technologies to ultimately benefit society. The public can learn about Toyota&amp;rsquo;s technologies and how to share their ideas at &lt;a href="http://www.toyota.com/ideasforgood"&gt;www.toyota.com/ideasforgood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Submissions &amp;ndash; accepted November 8, 2010 through February 28, 2011 &amp;ndash; will be evaluated by independent judges, and the winners of the challenge have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life by participating in a design session. To inspire innovative new ideas, the initiative will be supported by an advertising campaign highlighting the unique ways Toyota technology has been repurposed, or could be repurposed, to improve other areas of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re sharing a side of Toyota that many are not aware of and engaging the public in a way we&amp;rsquo;ve never done before,&amp;rdquo; said Bill Fay, group vice president of marketing for TMS. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re shining a light on some of our revolutionary technologies, which have been used to improve people&amp;rsquo;s quality of life, in order to encourage the public to help us identify the next big &amp;lsquo;idea for good.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Toyota&amp;rsquo;s innovations inside the car are well known, the company has also developed technologies which transcend that boundary and benefit people in other ways. For example, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C., is utilizing Toyota&amp;rsquo;s Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS) software to study head injuries sustained by football players. THUMS, originally developed to simulate vehicle crash-related injuries, was shared with Wake Forest to allow researchers to model head injuries and study how hits on the football field can affect athletes. Wake Forest researchers hope the THUMS software will help find ways to prevent and treat head injuries, and create even safer football helmets. Recent concern with football-related head injuries has further emphasized the importance of their study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Similarly, when Yellowstone National Park set out to build a new visitor education center, the vision of the design team was to meet the U.S. Green Building Council&amp;rsquo;s (USGBC) environmentally responsible Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards. Toyota encouraged the park to set its goal higher after hosting a tour of the Gold LEED campus headquarters in Torrance, Calif. Toyota shared its environmental-building insights and technology with the park&amp;rsquo;s architects. Toyota also donated $1 million to the Yellowstone Park Foundation, completing the $15 million of private funding needed to start the construction. In August, Yellowstone exceeded the Silver goal, achieving a Gold LEED certification by the USGBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To support the initiative, Toyota&amp;rsquo;s advertising agency Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi LA has created a marketing campaign to further demonstrate Toyota&amp;rsquo;s commitment towards innovation and continuous improvement. The campaign utilizes broadcast, print and online mediums to showcase five Toyota technologies: Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS), Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD), Solar Powered Ventilation System, Touch Tracer Display, and Advanced Parking Guidance System (APGS). The campaign will direct people to an online hub at &lt;a href="http://www.toyota.com/ideasforgood.com"&gt;www.toyota.com/ideasforgood.com&lt;/a&gt;, where they can learn more about the technologies listed above. Consumers can share their ideas on the &amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good&amp;rdquo; consumer-challenge site for a chance to make them a reality. Additionally, they can view background information on the panel of experts serving as consumer challenge judges: Joel Stitzel, Ph.D. of Wake Forest University; Keith Grossman of WIRED Magazine; Grace Hawthorne of Stanford University Design School; Jake Ward of Popular Science and Josh Morenstein of fuseproject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The online hub will also host case studies and videos that highlight organizations leveraging Toyota technologies to improve consumer experience and well being. These organizations include NASCAR, Yellowstone National Park and Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;As a leader in quality, Toyota is focused on innovating better cars for a better quality of life,&amp;rdquo; said Fay. &amp;ldquo;The campaign inspires new thinking about what Toyota has already been doing for many years. Ultimately, with consumers&amp;rsquo; help, we hope to inspire new ways that our innovation can benefit society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help inspire viewers&amp;rsquo; imaginations, the first of three TV commercials features a real world application of THUMS technology used by Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. The two future commercials will show how Toyota&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Synergy Drive and Solar Powered Ventilation System technologies could be repurposed to benefit the community and encourage participation in the &amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good&amp;rdquo; challenge. To view the TV commercials, visit the Toyota USA YouTube channel at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/toyota"&gt;www.youtube.com/toyota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ideas for Good&amp;rdquo; Featured Technologies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS) &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; An advanced injury-simulation software that measures more than the conventional crash test dummy can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; HSD converts braking energy into electricity. The hybrid system helps lower emissions while raising mpg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Solar-Powered Ventilation System &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; The Toyota Prius offers this system that helps keep the interior air temperature near the outside ambient temperature, when the vehicle is parked in direct sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Touch Tracer Display &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; An advanced touch-activated display system that allows drivers to control music, temperature and other features from the steering wheel without taking their eyes off the road. Touch Tracer is the first display system in the world to allow steering wheel controls to read out on the instrument panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Parking Guidance System (APGS) &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Available on the Toyota Prius, this system utilizes ultrasonic sensors in the front and rear bumpers to detect open parking spaces and helps guide the car into those spaces with only soft driver braking.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lean results transparent for Safelite Glass plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/8d67446a-d527-40eb-8aed-b1c469c2d363_safelite1.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safelite Glass Corporation, a leading producer of windshields for the automotive aftermarket, knew that to remain competitive with its Chinese counterparts, the company had to reduce costs. To do this, Safelite brought in experts from North Carolina State University&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Extension Service (IES) to meet its goals of reducing costs through improved efficiency and productivity within the company&amp;rsquo;s Enfield, N.C., plant. By implementing the principles of lean manufacturing, Safelite was able to retain sales to the tune of $2.6 million and save $670,000 in costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this reason the company was recognized on August 25 for its contribution to the &lt;a href="http://www.ies.ncsu.edu/1b4nc"&gt;1B4NC&lt;/a&gt; promise: to create $1 billion in economic benefit to the state of North Carolina from 2006 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bottlenecks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Downtime is not an option for the Halifax County facility, which produces approximately 700 different parts (20 simultaneously) and distributes them to 84 warehouses across the country. When any one of three furnaces shut down, bottlenecks occur, which can lead to a shutdown of the entire plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The goal of reducing bottlenecks prompted IES to facilitate a value stream map of the furnace department. A lean tool, value stream mapping (VSM) is a powerful technique for visualizing the flow of raw materials, information and finished products through all production steps for a particular product. For a VSM to be successful, it requires a group effort. In this case, it included members of the furnace department, Safelite leadership and IES facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/73f35180-62d9-4a12-844d-326bb9c89634_safelite2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The map indicated a need to reduce &amp;ldquo;no-loads&amp;rdquo;, as the company refers to them. No-loads, in the simplest of terms, are lost opportunities. Once a windshield is set, it is heated and then bent to specifications based on a vehicle make and model. This process follows an assembly line that passes through a high-temperature furnace. For every available slot that does not have a product, the company is wasting time, energy resources and, inevitably, money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The group developed a future state map, aimed to improve flow, layout and reduce inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Johnny McDonald, process engineer and 11-year veteran at Safelite, stated, &amp;ldquo;Lean changed the way we think around here. It used to be run, run, run. Now we run only what we need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Savings in work-in-process save investments in raw materials, space and labor, which all add to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results, clear as glass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another large component of Safelite&amp;rsquo;s lean work included the adoption of 5-S (sort, standardize, straighten, shine and sustain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quality manager Len Davis was amazed at the time that was saved by simply not having to dig for what you need. &amp;ldquo;Not having what you need when you need it is huge,&amp;rdquo; said Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The lean work that was done in the furnace area decreased no-loads and increased production potential to an extra 57,000 units annually. Lean also decreased overtime in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/acbbfbb9-e972-4a2a-bba3-c5f4ff1e03dd_safelite3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once witnessing the power of lean in the furnace area, Safelite brought it in to the glass processing center with the goal of reducing changeover time, or the time it takes to switch a machine from making one product to another. On one particular line, there are seven changeovers per shift at an average of 15 minutes each. Lean helped reduce changeover time by one-third, allowing more parts to be produced in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But lean isn&amp;rsquo;t just about producing more. The principles also lead to improved quality. By standardizing work instructions, the glass processing center saw the level of poor edge quality improve, which decreases breakage, again saving the company raw material dollars and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speak the language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	IES is the extension department of the College of Engineering at North Carolina State University. IES provides technical expertise, training and education to help improve and sustain North Carolina industry. IES extension experts typically have more than 15 years of direct industry experience in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Rich Glover, assistant vice president of manufacturing and distribution, said that working with IES lean specialist David Yates was more of a partnership than a typical client/vendor relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With all due respect, David&amp;rsquo;s not an academic; he understands production and the constraints of an organization,&amp;rdquo; said Glover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Glover likes the concept that lean requires input from the people on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Lean offered a baseline (for improvement), and it challenged our people to provide outcomes and solutions to their problems,&amp;rdquo; said Glover. &amp;ldquo;It also provided a common ground for engineers and plant employees to speak the same language while working toward a shared goal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/vN2DZ-84wag" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Driving lean across your organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/5/quick/158c7887-cfd5-4c51-9c3f-5dc028ae738d_wroblewski.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the more unfortunate expressions, in my opinion, found in the lean community is &amp;ldquo;driving lean across the organization&amp;rdquo;. I hear and see this all the time. It can be found in lean books, articles, job postings, job descriptions, reviews, etc. &amp;ldquo;I want someone who can drive lean across the organization&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;To drive lean across the company, we need ...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What comes to your mind when you hear the expression &amp;ldquo;driving lean across the organization&amp;rdquo;? How would you drive lean across the organization?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Is this what we really need to do to move toward being a lean company? Can we sustain efforts if we drive them? What happens if the driver leaves the company? What about respect for people or engaging the employees?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a lean leader (both internal and external), I have been asked in the past to &amp;ldquo;drive&amp;rdquo; lean across the company. Having someone, especially an outside consultant, tasked with driving lean is not the best way to become lean. Sure, you most certainly will get some fast results, but it will not be sustained and it may cause more damage to the organization than the gains you achieved.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To begin changing our lean culture, instead of using the term &amp;ldquo;driving&amp;rdquo;, can we choose better words to reflect a better approach? How about leading the way, guiding, teaching or setting the example?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Now, how would you lead the way? How would you set the example of the lean approach within your organization? Would your course of action be different than if you drive lean?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What is a team charter? And, what is its purpose?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A team charter is a document that is developed in a group setting that clarifies team direction while establishing boundaries. It is developed early during the forming of the team. The charter should be developed in a group session to encourage understanding and buy-in.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The team charter has two purposes. First, it serves as a source for the team members to illustrate the focus and direction of the team. Second, it educates others (for example, the organizational leaders and other work groups), illustrating the direction of the team.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Investing the required time to develop a charter reduces confusion about the group&amp;rsquo;s objectives. The charter also provides the information needed to reduce the risk of rework, enabling the (action, kaizen or lean) team to get it right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Team Charter Sections:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Team purpose &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; This answers three questions: What is the value of drawing these people together? What problem are they facing? And, what would be an acceptable outcome?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Duration and time commitment&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The amount of time the team will be working together needs to be documented (for example, is this a six-month timeframe?). Depending on proposed solutions, the duration of implementing these recommendations may require time beyond the team&amp;rsquo;s meeting schedule. Another aspect to be considered is the estimated amount of time that will be dedicated weekly or monthly.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Scope (in scope / out of scope)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Thinking though the scope helps to define the beginning and end of the spectrum. It may list departments included or excluded. The scope, while setting parameters, also helps the team leader(s) easily identify tasks that are outside of the scope, minimizing scope creep.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Members&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Team leader and members should be listed individually. This provides recognition and enhances commitment. Alternate members also can be listed. The team sponsor from the leadership group needs to be assigned and listed after the team members.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Desired end result&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This provides an opportunity to begin with the end in mind. This is where the sponsor can establish goals for the team to achieve. The goals need to be clearly defined. By defining the desired end result, the magnitude of the change becomes evident.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Supporting resources&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The supporting resources almost always include other people that were not assigned as team members but still add value toward the overall purpose.&amp;nbsp;Other resources are dependent on the team activities (blueprints, meeting rooms, travel budgets, corporate authority, software, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reporting plan&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This defines how the team will communicate progress. The team usually has a higher authority that they answer to, and it is important to report how the team activities are going and what hurdles the team is facing. The reporting plan should establish the frequency of reporting as well as content.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Deliverables&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This section defines the outputs. It should include key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure the intended success. By considering the KPIs at this stage, immeasurable deliverables are eliminated early. The deliverables should include the documents, the desired behaviors and a long-term auditing process that verifies the deliverables are in place.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This section considers other departments or organizational initiatives that may have overlap with the group&amp;rsquo;s purpose. It could also include key resources that are known subject matter experts (SMEs) in specific fields.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The hypothetical example below shows that all of the elements can come together to create a highly useful document that boost the team&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game plan to turn good intentions into effective, lean practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If any company can implement the Six Sigma or lean management principles, why isn&amp;#39;t every company an IBM or Toyota? Clearly, there is much more to successful management practices than copying the example straight out of the text book. So, how can companies turn good intentions into effective practices? What, at board and ground level, can managers actually do?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pharmanex succeeds with 6S Quality Process</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Nu Skin and Pharmanex uses proprietary technology in its manufacturing processes to maintain tight quality controls through all stages of product development. The key to consistent quality is the Pharmanex 6S Quality Process, the basis of the company&amp;#39;s pharmaceutical approach to product development.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Continuous improvement approach reduces errors in records</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Routine floor audits and data-gathering protocols uncovered some surprises at MEDRAD: Up to 20 percent of all in-process device history record (DHR) packets contained an error. This rate was particularly troubling because MEDRAD employees were double- and even triple-checking the required paperwork for the medical devices manufactured by the company to ensure accuracy prior to submission to the product release coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company, located in Pittsburgh, is a global leader in developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing diagnostic imaging and therapeutic medical devices used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular and other diseases. A 2003 winner of the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, MEDRAD employs more than 2,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recognition of Errors Leads to Team Improvement Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operating in a government-regulated environment, MEDRAD places great importance on product and operational quality as well as on specific paper trail requirements such as DHRs. Created for each medical product assembled, DHRs contain records of the manufacture date, assemblers responsible for manufacturing, test results and more. DHRs are also known as traveler packages, according to Matt Boyle, plant quality manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The traveler package is simply the paper documentation that travels with the unit during assembly,&amp;rdquo; says Boyle, an American Society for Quality senior member and the chair-elect for ASQ&amp;rsquo;s Pittsburgh Section. &amp;ldquo;The manufacturing steps are recorded, signed and dated. This becomes our objective evidence that the unit was built to specification,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2004, routine floor audits uncovered that up to 20 percent of all in-process DHR packets contained an error. Additionally, data collected during a subsequent protocol confirmed that processes for assuring DHR quality prior to product release were ineffective and causing unnecessary rework and delays during the product release process. The data captured the attention of company leaders in the compliance and manufacturing areas and led to a continuous improvement project to reduce the error rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aligning Project Goals to Corporate Goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	At MEDRAD, the impact of all continuous improvement projects is assessed against five corporate objectives as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Exceed financials.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Grow the company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve quality and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve customer satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve employee satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The DHR error reduction project supported all five corporate objectives in varying degrees, with the highest priority devoted to improving quality and productivity. The team was tasked with making significant improvement in the quality of DHRs by reducing error rates prior to product release review from 20 percent to 5 percent while developing processes that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t negatively affect efficiency or interfere with growth capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securing Buy-In&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement team identified key stakeholders for the project by focusing on areas of the business that would experience the most impact, such as regulatory and corporate compliance, quality and operations. Representatives from these areas were invited to provide oversight, sponsorship and input at the corporate, plant and department levels. Maintaining cross-functional representation on the improvement team was key for all stakeholders, as was the opportunity to approve changes to procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applying Continuous Improvement Methodology to Reduce Errors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement team, which finished fourth in ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2008 Team Excellence Award process, followed MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s IMAGES Lean Six Sigma continuous improvement methodology. The acronym represents the key stages in the company&amp;rsquo;s quality improvement process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;dentify the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;easure the current state.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nalyze the root causes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;enerate potential solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xperiment and then &lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;xecute proven solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ustain improvements over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When identifying possible root causes for the high error rates, the team used the following analysis tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cause-and-effect diagramming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brainstorming with cross-functional teams&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pareto analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A cause-and-effect (or fishbone) diagram was useful for developing strategy on moving from a high rate of errors to no errors. This tool helped team members brainstorm about possible root causes associated with the reported defect types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improvement team also created a redundancy/gap matrix by asking: What procedural checks are in place upstream to prevent errors for each inspection step in the final quality control inspection procedure? The result of this activity was a table that made redundancies and gaps easy to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the matrix and the cause-and-effect diagrams, the team identified the following final root causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inconsistency: more checks for some product lines than for others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Redundancy: confusion as to who was responsible for what activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Compliance: some personnel not following checks as required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scattered data: error data stored in multiple databases, as well as manual tracking and reporting of errors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of technology: manual input of data throughout the process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Poor process: no standard DHR format across assembly cells, as well as overly complex documentation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of focus: no visible metrics or team objectives of performance feedback related to DHR accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team proceeded to validate these root causes on the company&amp;rsquo;s Stellant line, the highest volume injector product. The protocol was piloted for four months, which allowed the improvement team sufficient time to identify a correlation between the overall defects throughout all product lines and those found on the Stellant line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing a Three-Tiered Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The team&amp;rsquo;s two-year plan focused on three areas for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technology: to eliminate human error&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Process: to standardize and simplify DHR travelers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People: to implement systems to enable, measure and reward performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expected error reduction for each of the three solution types was analyzed to help prioritize implementation. For example, while the cost of technology-related solutions was high, this category also had a high probability of success &amp;ndash; a projected 29-percent error reduction rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technology Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Using brainstorming techniques, project timelines and cost analysis, the team selected three technology solutions for implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Automated electrical safety test cart: A fully mobile system would enhance the efficiency and accuracy of device history by collecting and printing test results, eliminating manual recording of test data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Crystal reports: These reports include all current revisions used on all production modules, eliminating the need to write the revisions on the assembly traveler.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electronic warranty: With this solution, an equipment record is created for every unit and stored in MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s business enterprise software. When the unit is prepared for shipping, the e-warranty is printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The three technology solutions were validated by protocols to ensure the documented testing, qualification, verification and/or validation requirements were met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Certain types of DHR errors, such as missed checkboxes, incomplete DHR travelers and missing serial numbers or labels, were best resolved using process improvements. The team&amp;rsquo;s improvement solutions included launching new device review travelers, creating and placing labels with visual work instructions (VWIs), incorporating the slash mark to cross out non-applicable areas, and improving DHR travelers by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminating revision spaces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removing redundant data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coordinating with barcode serial number team to scan serial numbers (eliminated recording serial numbers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;People-Related Solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once the technology and process solutions were in place, the team turned its attention to errors related to the accountability of the production associates responsible for completing the DHRs. These types of errors involved record-keeping as well as missing signatures, data and paperwork. The four solutions selected were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incorporate DHR accuracy as a key production team objective&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase employee incentive time related to DHR quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement targeted, independent reviews within the assembly process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implement real-time error notification and performance tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MEDRAD used two methods to motivate production team members to improve their quality performance related to DHRs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A significant portion of a production associate&amp;rsquo;s annual performance rating and salary increase was linked to DHR error performance. Aggressive objectives were included in each associate&amp;rsquo;s annual plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The company tied extra paid time off to achieving team objectives. During this project, more than one-third of the production team&amp;rsquo;s incentive time was based on DHR quality. In concert with these methods, MEDRAD also provided timely feedback to production associates through daily performance tracking for each production cell and the overall production team. Secondly, the company developed a process to ensure that supervisors receive notification of errors and review them with the responsible associates on the same day the error occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Error Rates Drop as Project Benefits Soar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Within just six months of implementing the people-focused solutions, the error rate fell below 5 percent and the project team achieved its goal. Performance improvement continued throughout 2007, and the error rate stood at a mere 2.2 percent for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tangible benefits of the improvement project were significant as MEDRAD saved $40,000 while reducing its overall DHR error rate to less than 5 percent. In addition, the project was also credited with several intangible benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greater focus on DHR quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased employee satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved communication among peers as well as between employees and supervisors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Employees becoming &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; of change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased focus on communication regarding errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the team learned a great deal about process improvement throughout the project, one of the key lessons focused on documentation. Boyle explains, &amp;ldquo;We had to educate people about the importance of documentation quality. The mind-set and focus of our assemblers tended to be on product quality and not on how accurately they completed the documentation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supporting Corporate Goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As noted earlier, all continuous improvement projects at MEDRAD are assessed against five corporate goals. The impact of this project dovetailed nicely with corporate goals as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Exceed financials: Reduced cost of poor quality ($45,000 annually).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Grow the company: Smoother ramp-up of new products.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve quality and productivity: Higher throughput with fewer resources reduced quality control manpower.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve customer satisfaction: Fewer delays of product to finished goods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve employee satisfaction: Streamlined, less tedious processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MEDRAD&amp;rsquo;s Ongoing Commitment to Continuous Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To support the implemented solutions, 70 quality system documents were revised, which required training to implement and sustain. While no quality system procedures were revised for the people-related solutions, the results have been sustained through the objective-setting process and by lowering the error rate objective in pursuing continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company introduced a DHR database, which provides the measurement system necessary to monitor performance. Both trend and Pareto data are reviewed during monthly quality council meetings and quarterly management review sessions. Goals are revised annually based on continuous improvement. In addition to trend and Pareto chart data, statistical process control is used to evaluate the performance of the process and to detect when changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dig Deeper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>N. Carolina rug manufacturer weaves continuous innovation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Capel Rugs Inc., a company built on innovation, understands the need for a quality, consistent product. The company enlisted the help of North Carolina State University&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Extension Service (IES) to improve efficiency and their competitive edge. The results are more than $2 million in economic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Capels are part of the fabric that is Troy, N.C. The Capels didn&amp;rsquo;t start out in the rug business, but the business of agriculture. A. Leon Capel Sr., owner of Gee-Haw Plowline Company back in 1917, produced plow lines used to steer horses or mules in the fields. But soon after the invention of the Model T, which revolutionized transportation including the introduction of the tractor, the need for plow lines became almost obsolete. Capel needed a new use for his materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/2d7bfa79-c15c-4537-b088-bd09008417a2_ncsu001.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 261px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He fashioned those raw materials into a continuous yarn, braided them and manufactured the world&amp;rsquo;s first continuous yarn braided rug. Ninety-two years and three generations later, Capel Rugs remains one of the largest manufacturers and importers of area rugs in the country. The second generation of A. Leon Capel Jr., Jesse S. Capel and Arron W.E. Capel used their own unique expertise to build a multi-million-dollar company with international acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Handing over the reigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/df64c7c5-4501-46a4-be01-18b5edd385d0_ncsu002.jpeg" style="width: 150px; height: 223px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Richard Capel stands in front of a building that has beared his family&amp;#39;s name since 1917.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Richard Capel, director of manufacturing and third generation, credits his grandfather, father and uncles for the innovations they bestowed to the company. Richard&amp;rsquo;s father, Arron, led the initiative for retail stores, of which Capel Rugs now claims 11. And Richard&amp;rsquo;s uncle, Jesse, designed the air tables used to spin the rug as it is sewn, reducing the need for manual handling. This, as well as other innovations, helped this company to prosper through the Great Depression and other economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As far as Richard&amp;rsquo;s contribution &amp;ndash; it just may be the incorporation of lean. The &amp;ldquo;a-ha&amp;rdquo; moment for Richard occurred after attending an event sponsored by IES describing principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS). TPS organizes the manufacturing and logistics processes while stressing the importance of quality interactions between suppliers and customers. Understanding and incorporating TPS is key to building a lean organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Change begets results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Richard brought home the principles of lean and began to implement them throughout the manufacturing operation. He trained the manufacturing department supervisors to recognize inefficiency and waste and to bring solutions to the table. He initiated a pull system where output is factored on customer demand vs. operational capacity. He also improved the inventory system with a kanban or triggering system that initiates a reorder or refill of supplies, ensuring availability of parts while simultaneously reducing inventory. Shipping performance improved and customers were able to take advantage of the Zip Ship program, allowing one-day turnaround on some orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less inventory lessens the need for warehouse space and, subsequently, rent and utilities. For these and additional waste-reduction measures, the company saved $890,000 annually. Cost savings and increased and retained sales were part of the more than $2 million in economic benefit the company reported at the completion of the projects with IES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pliability of lean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/0b11fef2-7490-4ca1-b186-62707b4dd006_ncsu003.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 151px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Jeanette Blue has been sewing for Capel since she was 16.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Processes in the creation of their products had been streamlined due to the incorporation of lean, so a logical approach included applying those same principles into the corporate office of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Lean works anywhere,&amp;rdquo; said Capel. &amp;ldquo;It works in the hospital, the office, the plant.&amp;rdquo; With leadership support, Amy Roberts, purchasing manager, brought the expertise of IES on-site to regulate raw material and supply inventories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After receiving a training grant from the Workforce Incumbent Act grant from the Pee Dee Workforce Development Board, Lean Office was applied to the corporate office in Troy. One process addressed was the set-up of new customer accounts so they could start ordering rugs right away. Formerly, the process of receiving the initial request, to granting the credit and database set-up, could take weeks to facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Steve Laton, lean extension specialist, conducted a value stream mapping (VSM) exercise, which is a lean tool that demonstrates visually the flow of raw materials, information and finished products or services through all production steps from receiving to shipping. Applying the VSM to the credit process, Laton helped identify the current state, which brings to light all of the inefficiencies and bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Once you visualize the problem areas, only then can you begin to resolve them,&amp;rdquo; said Laton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He and the Capel team mapped the future state, or the ideal flow, which removed 90 percent of non-value-added work from the process. They now typically grant credit and finalize the process within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This substantial reduction allows the order to be placed much quicker, the product to be manufactured and delivered to the customer quicker, and ultimately billed and paid for in a more timely fashion &amp;ndash; all adding to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though this lean event was an office initiative, it runs parallel to Richard&amp;rsquo;s vision of further lead time reductions &amp;ndash; continually improving and building a true customer-focused organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At Capel, innovation lives on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Capel Rugs Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Capel Rugs Inc. is based in Troy, N.C., where the company still does the spinning, dyeing, weaving, braiding and sewing for Capel&amp;rsquo;s American Original braided rugs. &lt;span class="style1"&gt;From original braided rugs and the finest hand-knotted rugs to innovative indoor-outdoor and youth-friendly collections, Capel offers more rugs in more categories than any other rug company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/8kTNiWe2Xio" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>TPM and operator asset ownership: This is my equipment!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) combines the traditionally American practice of preventive maintenance with total quality control and total employee involvement to create a culture where operators develop ownership of their equipment, and become full partners with maintenance, engineering and management to assure that equipment operates properly every day. As part of modern TPM applications, the asset owner/operator performs much, and sometimes all, of the routine autonomous maintenance (AM) tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Autonomous maintenance ideally ensures appropriate and effective efforts are expended since the machine is wholly the domain of one person or team. TPM is a critical adjunct to lean manufacturing. If machine uptime is not predictable and if process capabilities are not sustained, the processes become unstable and production flows will be interrupted. One way to think of TPM is &amp;ldquo;asset deterioration prevention&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;maintenance prevention&amp;rdquo;, not fixing/repairing machines in a constant reactive environment. For this reason, TPM is also referred to as &amp;ldquo;Total Productive Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Total Process Management&amp;rdquo;. TPM is a proactive approach that essentially aims to prevent any kind of losses before occurrence. Its motto is &amp;ldquo;zero error, zero work-related accident and zero loss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reacting to breakdowns and dealing with production losses is unfortunately still a daily routine for most asset-intensive manufacturing organizations. Competition continues to raise the bar, thus increasing pressure on the &amp;ldquo;cost of goods sold&amp;rdquo; (COGS) and the opportunity costs of lost production. With the globalization of manufacturing of most products, organizations must compete with low-cost producers and are forced to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What action to take? If it were as easy as hiring a smart leader for manufacturing, every plant would have the shiny wall plaque that illustrates their brilliance for excellent performance. Operational Excellence (OpEx) is based on a holistic asset design, asset care and asset management concept powered by Reliability Excellence (Rx). It requires total collaborative, fully integrated effort by all functional departments at a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Driving an organization toward OpEx is a realistic goal when there is solid Rx program and project management coupled with proven TPM strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From experience, Life Cycle Engineering knows that if the fundamentals of asset reliability are not in place, it is difficult to sustain TPM. Even with significant activities and training, sustainability is a challenge. LCE assures that all Rx elements are in place to support the TPM culture to grow in a responsible manner with the target of achieving Operational Excellence. The goal of this article is to show that a basic asset-centric care program can be an effective foundation for a fully functioning preventive and predictive maintenance and operator care program. Operator care correctly applied can make a profound contribution to any organization implementing a Six Sigma, continuous improvement or similar quality strategy. Most importantly, basic operator care can have a significant positive effect on asset availability coupled with reductions in operations and maintenance expenditures through the achievement of increased asset reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we will concentrate on some conceptual issues to operator care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Origins of operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care and Six Sigma, CI, other improvement methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care as part of the overall asset reliability strategy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Benefits of TPM/AM operator care programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Operator Care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care is a commitment by plant management, operations and maintenance to ensure that assets maintain their expected level of quality and volume for output, while reaching their expected life span within the plant. Operator care attempts to greatly reduce or eliminate reactive maintenance and is driven by operations/production. In operator care environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plant condition is optimum (TPM and 5-S are applied)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators are engaged in asset care
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Tighten, lubricate, clean, (detect, inspect, correct)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Can be autonomous maintenance (AM) (operator-performed maintenance)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standard operating procedures are in use&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reliability and operability is included in the design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment standardization is evident&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills (hard and soft) training is continuous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loss elimination is ongoing; overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is being measured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Small cross-functional teams are solving problems (failure modes and effects analyses, five-why&amp;rsquo;s, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;TPM is Operator Driven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The operators&amp;rsquo; creed of TPM is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it clean&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it lubricated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor for degradation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain it before production is affected&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Simplify and improve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d759dc67-600c-4ea8-b594-8313224c954f_scheller01.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These elements are all carried out in a thorough asset care regimen. The investigative part of this regimen also attempts to catch incipient problems by monitoring assets for both visual (qualitative) and measurable (quantitative) indications of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with the inspection processes of the program, an operator care process focuses on continued education of operators (all shifts), maintenance and reliability staff. Operator care puts high emphasis on both operator-managed inspection programs and lubrication management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Origins of TPM/AM and Operator Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the 1950s, the Japanese industry, faced with considerable challenges, developed a variant of planned maintenance now known as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). As with planned maintenance, frequent inspections are a fundamental tenet of the TPM process, with a heavy emphasis on involving equipment operators in the inspection process. Operator care is derived from several of the concepts (&amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo;) of TPM. Some of these concepts are found in the sample slides shared below. They are from a TPM conference in India and are courtesy of Shiram Pistons &amp;amp; Rings Ltd., an automotive manufacturer in that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. Fusion of Corporate Management &amp;amp; TPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d5d7e1b0-5646-4412-8bda-7163a1bf9e9e_scheller03.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 355px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7. People Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care and Six Sigma, CI, Other Asset Improvement Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A Six Sigma (DMAIC) systemic quality program provides businesses with the tools to improve the capability of their business processes. Six Sigma can be defined as a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects in a wide variety of processes, which includes all forms of manufacturing and process industries. A key element of Six Sigma programs is &amp;ldquo;kaizen&amp;rdquo;, the Japanese process of continuous improvement using a variety of problem-solving and analysis techniques. One of the fundamentals of the Six Sigma approach is the requirement for data. Data sets are used to determine the original state of a process, the current state of that process, the rate of improvement and the proximity of the process to the desired quality levels. Operator care, with its emphasis on frequent and rigorously scheduled inspections, produces a steady stream of both quantified and qualified evaluations of assets, systems and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data collected by these inspections, plus the data generated to measure the compliance to the operator care inspection schedule itself, can be used effectively to generate metrics for any Six Sigma program. A well-run basic asset care program is not only a catalyst for improvement in and of itself; it can also be one of the primary data gathering tools to evaluate the effectiveness of all continuous improvement procedures within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care is Part of Overall Asset Management and Reliability Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care fits in as a foundational element of a site&amp;rsquo;s total plant operational and Reliability Excellence strategy. The strategy details the availability and contribution of a plant&amp;rsquo;s resources to be used in asset inspection, condition monitoring, planning and scheduling, and logistics for the creation of a reliability program. The strategy provides for optimal use of organizational resources with sufficient asset availability to meet the organization&amp;rsquo;s output requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A modern plant asset management effort uses the skill sets available within the organization (and through the judicious use of external expertise) to generate improvements in all elements of LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Excellence model (see &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html"&gt;www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of implementing all integrated elements holistically can consequently lead to substantial performance improvements, value creation and securing a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of TPM/AM Operator Care Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care programs have been implemented in hundreds of organizations &amp;ndash; both in process and discrete manufacturing facilities. Benefits of a successfully implemented asset care and reliability improvement program include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improvement in OEE&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Manufacturing Cost Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Labor Utilization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Production Lead Time Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Positive Impact on EHS performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Quick Response Manufacturing as an alternative to lean</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Professor Suri tells about Quick Response Manufacturing at BoschScharnieren in Doetinchem, the Netherlands. QRM is a companywide strategy for lead-time reduction throughout the enterprise. Using QRM, companies have reduced their lead times by 80 to 90 percent. As a result, these companies have not only seen large increases in market share, but also experienced significant cost reduction and quality improvement. Although lean manufacturing techniques can be powerful in certain situations, for companies making low-volume or custom-engineered products, lean techniques do not apply too well. Quick Response Manufacturing can be a more effective competitive strategy for companies targeting such markets.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>16 organizations to receive site visits for 2010 Baldrige Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Panel of Judges for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the nation&amp;rsquo;s highest recognition for organizational performance excellence, has selected 16 organizations for the final review stage for the 2010 Award. Starting next month, teams of business, education, health care and nonprofit experts will make site visits to two organizations in the manufacturing category, four in small business, one in service, one in education, seven in health care and one in non-profit. This is the first year since the addition of the newest category, non-profit (in 2007), in which organizations from all six categories will receive site visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige Program received 83 applications in 2010 (three manufacturers, two service companies, seven small businesses, 10 educational organizations, 54 health care organizations and seven non-profit/governmental organizations). The applicants were evaluated rigorously by an independent board of examiners in seven areas: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis and knowledge management; workforce focus; process management; and results. Examiners will provide 300 to 1,000 hours of review to each applicant receiving a site visit, and all applicants will receive a detailed report on the organization&amp;rsquo;s strengths and opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 Baldrige Award recipients are expected to be announced in late November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Named after Malcolm Baldrige, the 26th Secretary of Commerce, the Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987. The award &amp;ndash; managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with the private sector &amp;ndash; promotes excellence in organizational performance, recognizes the achievements and results of U.S. organizations, and publicizes successful performance strategies. The award is not given for specific products or services. Since 1988, 80 organizations have received Baldrige Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thousands of organizations use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence to guide their enterprises, improve performance and get sustainable results. This proven improvement and innovation framework offers organizations an integrated approach to key management areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Learn from inspirational keynote speakers at AME conference</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As many manufacturers begin their journey through an economic recovery phase, it is vital to uphold a solid organizational foundation that will help create and sustain global success. Building excellence inside is inevitable at the 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference, hosted by the Association for Manufacturing Excellence (AME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From November 15-19 in Baltimore, Md., an expected 2,500 manufacturing practitioners from around North America will learn from six inspirational keynote speakers who will share their Lean strategies and success stories. Each of these leaders explore continuous improvement and best practices on a daily basis. Through their experiences, conference attendees will discover innovative decision-making methods, enhanced leadership skills, money-saving strategies and more efficient business processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference will begin with a motivational message from Dr. John Izzo, author of &amp;ldquo;Five Secrets You Must Discover Before You Die&amp;rdquo; and one of &lt;em&gt;Leadership Excellence&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;rsquo;s Top 100 Thought Leaders in North America. He will discuss how organizations can reach sustainable success through the integration of values and purposeful leadership and business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. John Toussaint, CEO of the ThedaCare Center for Healthcare Value, will present on lean thinking in the healthcare industry. Specifically, he will draw on his experience introducing his company to the ThedaCare Improvement System, a continuous improvement model that helped save millions in healthcare costs, while delivering better quality care to patients.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Speaking on the strategic importance of customer experience and company culture will be Colleen Abdoulah, CEO of WOW! Internet, Cable and Phone, and the only female to lead a Top 20 cable company in that position. Attendees will also hear her discuss the development of gender-balanced management and leadership and cultivation of authentic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Howard Putnam, author of &amp;ldquo;The Winds of Turbulence&amp;rdquo; and former CEO of Southwest Airlines, will present on how successful organizations get through the maze of the business world. Specifically, he will explore thinking outside of the box, organizational visions and developing a people-centered culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a principal investor in several Lean enterprises, George Koenigsaecker has significant experience leading lean initiatives. He developed and implemented the &amp;ldquo;Danaher Business System,&amp;rdquo; a comprehensive lean enterprise model, and led the HON Company&amp;rsquo;s lean conversion, which tripled the volume for the office furniture manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Malcolm Gladwell, author of &amp;ldquo;Outliers: The Story of Success&amp;rdquo; and one of &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;100 Most Influential People,&amp;rdquo; will conclude the conference. In his address, Gladwell will explore factors that truly foster success, new tools to understand how trends work and how leaders can master successful decision-making. A staff writer for The New Yorker, his work has been described as idea-driven narratives focused on the everyday, and a combination of research with more personal, social and historical material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In its 26th year of progress, AME is pleased to offer participants countless network opportunities, practitioner-to-practitioner and company-to-company shared-learning experiences, and innovative Lean tools and strategies at the 2010 International Excellence Inside Conference.

            <title>Leaders must lead: It's not just about profitability, survival</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Political and economic influences have great implications for today&amp;rsquo;s leaders as they maneuver their way through ever-expanding mine fields. This economic and political climate is forcing leaders to rethink their operating plan. This is a time for action, not reaction; it is a time for decisive leadership to guide the company safely through a quagmire while preparing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Maintaining market share, maximizing operational tightness and propagating the long-term view for the company are critical during an economic downturn,&amp;rdquo; said the CEO of a major privately held corporation. This thought process isn&amp;rsquo;t just common sense, but crucial for economic survivability and mobility once the economy starts to move forward again.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The CEO went on to say, &amp;ldquo;a company cannot afford to lose any market share nor erode operating capital during a downturn because there will be nothing left for marketing, advertising and hiring when the economy does turnaround. A business gets into real trouble when it loses its market share and depletes its capital; it will not survive &amp;ndash; no matter how good the economy might get. Therefore, leadership needs to focus on the long-term view while getting everyone aboard to think survival, expense reduction and increasing income without any negative financial impact on existing capital.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When leadership focuses on short-term business survival, assets are protected, jobs continue to exist and market share and profitability is maintained. Once a carefully laid-out short-term plan for survival has been accomplished, it is crucial that leaders not get so bogged down with survival that they forget to look at the long-term view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are the kind of times, circumstances and events that require leaders to make hard decisions and realize there is a way to behave during an economic crisis. Survivability is all about reducing expenses, making profits and maintaining capital. Company leaders who understand how to make money are the survivors and will be the change-makers who help turn the economy around and ensure their companies thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The longer the downturn, the more the consumers will dig in and hold onto their hard-earned money. Once the economy does turn around, they will pay down their accumulated debt before spending. To bridge these turbulent times, leaders need to have a plan that includes a long-term view covering everything from being prudent on expenses and increasing employee efficiency to eroding the competitions market share. Here are some easy-to-implement survival principles that focus on the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shift everyone&amp;rsquo;s thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Move from a cost-cutting mode to a money-making and increasing-market-share mode while not digging into existing capital. Employees tend to spend capital, so they need to be engaged from the bottom up to look for ways to either save money or increase sales and revenues. When encouraged to participate in the company&amp;rsquo;s survival, they take a piece of ownership in its survival and become part of the solution team instead of an individual trying to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Increase employee efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt; Eliminate energy drainers and clutter in the workplace and organize it so employees can find anything they need at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. Time is money, and employees are a huge investment. Clutter is a distraction that prevents an employee from maximizing their productivity and the company&amp;rsquo;s profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade your organizational chart.&lt;/strong&gt; Be an all-inclusive organization and share this philosophy with your employees. Eliminate the old 19th-century Newtonian pyramid-shaped organizational chart and replace it with one that works from the center out like a spider&amp;rsquo;s web, where everyone is connected, productive and within the playing field. Employees do their best work when they feel they are relevant and make a difference in the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Leaders need to lead. &lt;/strong&gt;Focus on the long-term view. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve devised and implemented a plan for survival, focus all your energy on the big picture and where you want the company to be when the economy starts moving upward. Let someone else worry about the number of paper clips being used. It takes a leader to move safely through today&amp;rsquo;s economic mine fields. Followers need a leader with a vision to lead them into creating the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Being a leader is stressful enough during normal times. The stress is greatly magnified during this difficult economic and political environment. Plan some creative time during hectic days to get the right side of the brain working. Stress comes from logical left brain thinking not being balanced by creative right brain thinking. It&amp;rsquo;s the right side of the brain that helps you create new ideas and solve problems such as getting through this economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders need to find ways to solve problems, improve survivability and increase market share while protecting existing capital. This type of breakthrough thinking comes through creativity. Add some right brain activities to your schedule such as creative writing, painting, listening to classical or new age music, quiet walks in nature or meditation. If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck at your desk, take a few minutes to do some creative visualization. Close your eyes and mentally visit a place you love &amp;ndash; remembering to breathe deeply while in that frame of mind. You will feel refreshed and the creative juices will flow, helping you solve the most complex of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It takes a leader with vision and the creative know-how to turn things around and have everyone in the company think as one instead of as a number of individuals. Leaders must realize they cannot use 19th-century leadership tools in the 21st century, especially those that are narrow and top down instead of inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leadership is all about creating tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s vision while living through today&amp;rsquo;s difficult times. Profitability and maintaining the company&amp;rsquo;s market share while not dipping into capital must be the long term objective which builds a fertile foundation for company growth when the economy turns upward.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What must be in place in order to reduce my WIP?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Work-in-process, or WIP, is nothing more than a strategic buffer within the manufacturing process. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that your manufacturing process is made up of two steps which require a total lead time of 45 days in order to produce the final product. Step No. 1 has a process lead time (PLT) of 25 days, and Step No. 2 needs 20 days. Additionally, your shipping department has established a five-day lead time for all customers within North America. Overall, the total lead time for a single order within this example is 50 days. Now, if your customer expects your organization to deliver within five days of placing their order, you must establish buffers, or on-hand inventories, prior to the shipping step to ensure on-time and in-full delivery of products despite the 45-day lead-time for manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/wikoff021.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, what must be in place in order to remove the WIP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A partnership agreement between sales and operations that clarifies the actual process lead time to the customer without the WIP buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Visual process controls that enable plant personnel to quickly and easily identify variation in the manufacturing process so that the source may be eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Narrow specifications for raw materials and a vendor/supplier management process that effectively measures conformance to agreed-upon standards.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A stabile, reliable manufacturing process that consistently produces a quality product within the agreed-upon lead time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Removing WIP, although very appealing by the numbers, is a luxury that comes with a reliable manufacturing process. In order to capitalize on the reduction of WIP, your organization must focus first on minimizing variation that&amp;rsquo;s caused by equipment failures, raw material defects and poor process control.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>WMEP assistance generates $164M in impact for Wisconsin manufacturers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Successful efforts to fuel business growth contributed to financial gains reported by state manufacturers assisted by the Wisconsin Manufacturing Extension Partnership (WMEP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WMEP services generated an economic impact of $164 million with 973 jobs created and retained during the past fiscal year. Increased and retained sales account for nearly two thirds of the total impact. During the past five years, WMEP-assisted manufacturers have reported nearly $1 billion in economic impact with 6,557 jobs created and retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The good news is that we continue to see manufacturers move out of survival mode into growth mode. The ability to develop new markets, products and customer solutions is more important than ever,&amp;rdquo; said Michael Klonsinski, executive director of WMEP, a nonprofit consulting firm that helps small and midsize manufacturers grow and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	WMEP-assisted companies reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		$102 million in increased/retained sales&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		$30 million in cost savings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		$32 million in investment impact, including new plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, an analysis of the data projects a $10 million tax revenue benefit to the State of Wisconsin as a result of sales and jobs impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wisconsin manufacturers reporting positive impact include:&lt;/p&gt;

The firm, a leader in automated manufacturing systems controls, just hired five employees and anticipates sales to double in 2011. Though sales declined during the recession, the company kept layoffs at a minimum. &amp;ldquo;The typical recession mentality is to hunker down and ride it out. We saw it as an opportunity to bring new talent into our organization and get ready for the recovery,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In 1996, Charlie Leiby started &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.centerlinemachine.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=6368868&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Centerline+Machine%2C+Inc.&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;md5=6ca9097ac370ad87477684749e224e55" target="_blank"&gt;Centerline Machine Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in his garage with one milling machine and a vision to build his own company. Today the Waupaca-based custom machining and fabrication firm has 44 employees, and in September will move into a new 45,000 square-foot plant to accommodate its 500 percent growth rate. Since 2005, WMEP has helped Centerline implement lean manufacturing, develop a lean culture, and most recently, facilitate an Enterprise Business Transformation project to manage the firm&amp;rsquo;s meteoric growth. &amp;ldquo;WMEP has played a key role in helping us improve performance, quality and engage employees in continuous improvement,&amp;rdquo; Leiby said.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

The effort includes sales programs, new advertising and outreach to international markets through the ExporTech program offered by WMEP and the Wisconsin Department of Commerce. WMEP also has helped Harvard implement lean manufacturing to improve efficiency. Despite the recession, Harvard increased sales 5 percent last year. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re constantly working to raise the bar for quality and innovation in our industry,&amp;rdquo; said Otto Knottnerus, president. &amp;ldquo;WMEP&amp;rsquo;s expertise and guidance has been an excellent resource for our firm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

DeCrane&amp;rsquo;s focus on lean has helped the firm maintain stable earnings, reduce inventory by $3.5 million, increase revenue per employee-hour and enhance machining capabilities. Tress adds that employees&amp;rsquo; willingness to diversify their skills is a tremendous asset, providing flexibility and efficiency gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing contributes $48.8 billion to Wisconsin&amp;rsquo;s economy and employs 429,000 workers. WMEP provided services to 889 state manufacturers last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The economic impact survey of 206 WMEP client firms is part of a national evaluation conducted by an independent firm for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). WMEP is an affiliate of the NIST Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a national network of 59 centers that provide assistance to small and midsize manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Call for entries in fourth annual workplace improvement challenge</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Humantech announced that it is sponsoring its fourth annual Find It &amp;ndash; Fix It Challenge, which recognizes and rewards simple and effective workplace solutions that result in increased productivity, improved worker morale, and fewer workplace injuries and illnesses. The contest, open to all Humantech clients, past or present, was derived from Humantech RAPID Team Events, which are based on the concept of making quick, simple, visible changes to improve ergonomic issues in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Find It &amp;ndash; Fix It Challenge is a great opportunity to recognize organizations investing in and supporting their human capital&amp;rdquo; said James Good, president of Humantech. He added that, &amp;ldquo;All the contest entries are an inspiration to business leaders looking for&amp;nbsp;ways to leverage ergonomics to create more profitable and sustainable companies. Recent winning entries are highly effective solutions that display a level of simplicity approaching genius.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fifteen finalists will be selected by a panel of Certified Professional Ergonomists and Humantech staff members. From the field of finalists two honorable mentions and one first place winner will be selected. &amp;nbsp;The finalists will be notified by mid November and the winning photos and submissions will be posted on the Humantech Web site in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 2009 Find it &amp;ndash; Fix It Challenge, John Deere Des Moines Works Ankeny, Iowa, facility received top honors for their lift cart muffler fixture. Honorable mentions were given to Terex Handlers of Baraga, Mich., for its cable track installer and Delta Faucet Company of Jackson, Tenn., for its project punchout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations are asked to submit their best workplace improvements, highlighting the implementation of a creative, sustainable and high-impact ergonomic solution. The contest will run from July 15 to September 15, 2010. An information package can be downloaded at &lt;a href="http://www.humantech.com/aboutus/findfix"&gt;www.humantech.com/aboutus/findfix&lt;/a&gt;. Questions about the online application process or the challenge can be e-mailed to &lt;a href="mailto:krobertson@humantech.com"&gt;krobertson@humantech.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/hL6wPEbHlPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota to start studying outside assessment of its quality</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announced that&amp;nbsp;it will start studying an assessment of TMC&amp;#39;s quality-assurance review-and-improvement measures prepared by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE), a non-TMC-affiliated organization specializing in quality control, and four JUSE-recommended experts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The assessment focuses on the measures adopted at the first meeting of TMC&amp;#39;s Special Committee for Global Quality, held on March 30, 2010, and chaired by TMC president Akio Toyoda.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	At the second meeting of the Special Committee for Global Quality, which is scheduled for October, TMC plans to review the status of the quality-assurance-improvement measures it has undertaken, including those based on the assessment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="bnormal"&gt;Outside Experts Recommended by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Baldrige program seeks input during improvement events</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Inspired by last year&amp;rsquo;s successful first try at a &amp;ldquo;virtual improvement day,&amp;rdquo; the Baldrige National Quality Program (BNQP) is planning two online events this July and August when interested parties can again recommend ways to better the program that guides organizations toward innovation and performance excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) collects suggestions throughout the year on opportunities for improving the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award processes and other key BNQP activities. For many years, the program held an annual &amp;ldquo;Improvement Day&amp;rdquo; at NIST&amp;rsquo;s Gaithersburg, Md., campus at which stakeholders could review, consolidate, filter, prioritize and recommend which suggestions should be implemented. In 2009, the event went virtual for the first time by expanding to three separate online discussion sessions. These Virtual Improvement Days proved so successful that they&amp;rsquo;re back for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Baldrige program will consider all recommendations for improvement during events on July 27, 2010, and August 2, 2010, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time both days. A third date will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anyone wishing to participate in one of the sessions should register by sending an e-mail to &lt;a href="mailto:iday@nist.gov"&gt;iday@nist.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The account also may be used to send improvement suggestions prior to the virtual events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Members of the professional social media site LinkedIn can send in suggestions by joining the Baldrige Improvement Discussion Group. Log into your LinkedIn account, select &amp;ldquo;Groups&amp;rdquo; on the pull-down search menu at the top of the home page, enter &amp;ldquo;Baldrige Improvement Discussion Group,&amp;rdquo; and when the group page comes up, ask to join. Once you have joined, click on the &amp;ldquo;Subgroup&amp;rdquo; tab and sign up for the &amp;ldquo;Improvement Day 2010&amp;rdquo; subgroup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/continuous_improvement/~4/Blq4pm9hcfw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Virtual benchmarking tour of lean Raytheon plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Raytheon&amp;#39;s Integrated Air Defense Center (IADC) in Andover, Mass., began their continuous improvement journey in 2003 with a Raytheon Six Sigma initiative. This initiative began the evolution of a culture of continuous improvement, waste identification and waste elimination throughout the organization. The employees at the IADC recognized the importance of lean manufacturing and continued to implement best practices through the follow-on Lean Initiative for Value Excellence. Starting in 2005, the IADC focused even more acutely on Lean transformation by engaging every employee through a program they call Operational Excellence. The foundation for Operational Excellence is based on getting every employee engaged in the business and focused on eliminating waste through Total Employee Engagement (TEE).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Through the Operational Excellence model, the IADC has consistently improved quality and productivity throughout its processes. In recognition of their efforts, the Integrated Air Defense Center was awarded a 2008 North American Shingo Silver Medallion for Operational Excellence and is also a 2008 Environmental Protection Agency WasteWise Gold Achievement Award winner.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This Virtual Plan Tour Video highlights many diverse examples of continuous improvement that have been implemented through the cohesive efforts of the Raytheon workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A slice of Six Sigma and continuous improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of people shy away from learning and using Six Sigma as part of their continuous improvement efforts because they think it requires exceptional mathematic and statistical abilities to implement. Well, good news, that&amp;#39;s not true! But why should you add Six Sigma to your CI program? To reduce variation and improve reliability and repeatability in your processes thus avoiding the significant costs of poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;
