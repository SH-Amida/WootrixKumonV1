            <title>Entergy Named Climate Performance Leader</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Entergy Corporation recently was named to the 2015 Climate &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; List of S&amp;amp;P 500 leaders in climate performance. The company was the only U.S. utility included on the list, which was compiled by CDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP is an international, not-for-profit organization providing a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the third consecutive year Entergy has been named to the Climate &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; List, which identifies companies that are leading the way globally in their actions to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change, and ensure adaptation and transparency. Of the nearly 2,000 companies from around the world participating in the assessment, 113 made the list, including 34 from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Entergy was also one of four U.S. utilities named to the CDP U.S. Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. The top 10 percent of companies assessed are noted for providing comprehensive information about the measurement and management of their carbon footprint, their climate change strategy, and risk management processes and outcomes. Since 2008, Entergy has been included on the disclosure index seven times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Entergy&amp;#39;s scores of 99 for disclosure and &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; rating in performance leadership extend to its supply chain organization. For comparison, of the 4,000 participating companies worldwide, the CDP supply chain averages were 60 for disclosure and a &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; rating for performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Each year Entergy participates in the CDP assessment as a means of benchmarking and elevating our risk assessment, reviewing and adjusting our climate strategy, and measuring our progress against our goals,&amp;quot; said Rod West, Entergy&amp;#39;s executive vice president and chief administrative officer. &amp;quot;It is important to be recognized for the forward-thinking steps our company is taking to ensure long-term success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations, Entergy delivers electricity to 2.8 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE Completes Acquisition of Alstom Power and Grid Businesses</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Electric (GE) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Alstom&amp;#39;s power and grid businesses. The completion of the transaction follows the regulatory approval of the deal in more than 20 countries and regions, including the United States, the European Union, China, India, Japan and Brazil. It is GE&amp;#39;s largest-ever industrial acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE reached an agreement with Alstom in 2014 to purchase Alstom&amp;#39;s power and grid businesses for $13.5 billion. Adjusting for the joint ventures announced in June 2014 (renewables, grid and nuclear), changes in the deal structure, price adjustments for remedies, net cash at close, and the effects of currency, the purchase price is approximately $10.6 billion. This includes working capital usage of approximately $0.6 billion in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The completion of the Alstom power and grid acquisition is another significant step in GE&amp;#39;s transformation,&amp;quot; said Jeff Immelt, GE chairman and CEO. &amp;quot;The complementary technology, global capability, installed base and talent of Alstom will further our core industrial growth. We are open for business and ready to deliver one of the most comprehensive technology offerings in the energy sector for our customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE also announced that it has completed the sale of its rail signaling business to Alstom for approximately $800 million.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Entergy Plant Completes $58-million Maintenance Upgrades</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Entergy&amp;#39;s Palisades nuclear power plant in southwest Michigan recently returned to service after a $58-million investment to upgrade and inspect plant equipment, along with a $63-million investment in new fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plant shut down on Sept. 16, 2015, to begin a planned refueling outage and was reconnected to the grid on Oct. 19, 2015. The outage put 1,600 skilled professionals and $58 million to work completing more than 9,000 tasks to refuel and make upgrades, inspections and replacements to prepare the plant for continuing safe and reliable service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This refueling outage was a great success,&amp;quot; said Tony Vitale, Palisades site vice president. &amp;quot;The equipment maintenance, replacements and upgrades prepared Palisades to deliver another 18 months of safe, clean, reliable electricity to southwest Michigan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the outage Palisades also completed safety enhancements ordered after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. Those enhancements will serve as greater defense against potential external events, such as tornados, flooding and earthquakes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In early September, Palisades also underwent an inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to address occupational radiation safety related to control rod drive replacement during the 2014 refueling outage. Because of corrective actions the plant has taken, the NRC returned the plant to the agency&amp;#39;s highest safety category. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations, Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including nearly 10,000 megawatts of nuclear power, making it one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading nuclear generators.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE to Upgrade California Power Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE&amp;#39;s Power Generation Services recently signed a multiyear services agreement with Southern California Edison (SCE) to upgrade the utility&amp;#39;s Mountainview Generating Facility, a 1,054-megawatt (MW) combined-cycle power plant in Redlands, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The upgrade project will reduce the facility&amp;#39;s startup times, lower its emissions without using additional water and help to balance the growing role of renewables on the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our Mountainview station will be much more flexible, enabling it to more quickly respond to the needs of the California ISO system that is highly penetrated with solar power and other renewable sources,&amp;quot; said Stuart R. Hemphill, senior vice president at Southern California Edison. &amp;quot;GE&amp;#39;s solution also gives us a more efficient plant, creating greater value and savings for our customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE&amp;#39;s technologies will boost the station&amp;#39;s output, increase its efficiency and offer longer intervals between maintenance outages. By boosting Mountainview&amp;#39;s flexibility, the project will help SCE protect the grid from the intermittency of the state&amp;#39;s rapidly expanding renewable energy supplies while strengthening the facility&amp;#39;s competitive position in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are excited to support SCE&amp;#39;s upgrades to the Mountainview Generating Facility,&amp;quot; said Paul McElhinney, president and CEO of GE&amp;#39;s Power Generation Services. &amp;quot;This agreement underscores their confidence in our generation and combustion technologies and capabilities to execute an extremely complex project while increasing plant availability.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SCE&amp;#39;s Mountainview Generating Facility features four 7FA.03 units, two D-11 steam turbines and associated generators in combined cycle. As part of the new extended service agreement with SCE to upgrade the site&amp;#39;s generating equipment, GE will supply six Advanced Gas Path (AGP) sets, six sets of its Dry Low NOx 2.6+ (DLN2.6+) combustion system and four new unit rotors. GE also is providing extended steam turbine coverage along with premium generator coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Mountainview upgrade project reflects a broader commitment by SCE and other California utilities to curtail their water consumption to help the state battle chronic drought conditions. The DLN2.6+ combustion system will enable SCE to further reduce the Mountainview plant&amp;#39;s emissions without the need for using additional water in the process. Moreover, using GE&amp;#39;s technology, SCE can reduce both water consumption and emissions, helping them comply with tightening environmental regulations while also reducing their operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE is scheduled to begin installing its technology solutions at the Mountainview Generating Facility in 2016 and complete the project by May 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Interstate Power and Light Agrees to Reduce Emissions at Iowa Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In a settlement recently announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice, Interstate Power and Light, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy, has agreed to install pollution-control technology and meet stringent emission rates to reduce air pollution from the company&amp;#39;s seven coal-fired power plants in Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The settlement also requires Interstate Power and Light to spend a total of $6 million on environmental mitigation projects and pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;To serve the communities in which they operate, power plants must protect clean air for those living nearby,&amp;quot; said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA&amp;#39;s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. &amp;quot;This case delivers on the goals of EPA&amp;#39;s national enforcement initiative to reduce air pollution from the largest sources. By installing new equipment and funding mitigation projects, Interstate Power and Light can help conserve energy and cut pollution in communities across Iowa.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the settlement, Interstate Power and Light will install and continuously operate new and existing pollution-control technology at its two largest plants in Lansing and Ottumwa, and will retire or convert to cleaner-burning natural gas at its remaining five plants in Burlington, Cedar Rapids, Clinton, Dubuque and Marshalltown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new state-of-the-art pollution controls required by the settlement are expected to cost approximately $620 million. The EPA estimates that the settlement will reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by 32,500 tons per year and nitrogen-oxide emissions by 3,800 tons per year once the settlement is fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interstate Power and Light will also be required to spend $6 million on environmental mitigation projects. The company will choose from five potential projects, including solar energy and anaerobic digester installations, replacing coal-fired boilers at schools with lower-emission equipment, an alternative fuel vehicle replacement program, and a program to help residents change out wood-burning stoves and fireplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The settlement was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District Court of Iowa for 30 days to allow for public comment. The company is required to pay the penalty within 30 days after the court approves the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are thrilled to be a part of the renewable energy movement, especially when it&amp;#39;s in our own backyard,&amp;quot; said Edward Weisiger Jr., CEO of Carolina Cat Power Systems. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve had the privilege of serving the equipment needs of the Carolinas for over 85 years, and this project marks our continued service in the construction, utility and road-building industries. Shelby and Cleveland County have been a key part of our success over the years, and we are very pleased to be invested there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project is reflective of the current solar farm boom in North Carolina. The state ranks third in the nation with respect to the amount of solar power on the state&amp;#39;s grid. This is due in part to a state law mandating that, by the year 2020, one eighth of all power produced by Duke Energy must come from renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are proud to be part of this green initiative,&amp;quot; said Mike Brown, Carolina Cat Power Systems&amp;#39; general manager. &amp;quot;By using renewable energy, reducing waste and preserving our natural resources, we are helping to protect our planet now and for generations to come. Being good stewards of the beautiful planet on which we all live and work is crucial.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>70 Manufacturing Plants Earn EPA's Energy Star Certification for 2014</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced that 70 manufacturing plants have achieved Energy Star certification for their superior energy performance in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 70 plants saved a record amount of energy, cut their energy bills by $725 million and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 8 million metric tons, which is the equivalent to the annual total energy use of more than 650,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Energy Star-certified manufacturing plants are leading their industries by advancing energy efficiency and making cost-saving improvements while combating climate change,&amp;quot; said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy. &amp;quot;Through their work with EPA, the 2014 Energy Star manufacturing plants are demonstrating that making sustainability and energy-efficiency improvements is a smart business decision.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy Star-certified plants are independently verified on an annual basis to have reached the top 25 percent of energy performance for their industries nationwide. Among these are plants from the auto assembly, cement manufacturing, corn refining, food processing, glass manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and petroleum refining industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seven plants were certified for the first time: ConAgra Foods&amp;#39; frozen fried potato processing plant in American Falls, Idaho; ConAgra Foods&amp;#39; cookie and cracker baking plant in Ogden, Utah; Essroc Cement Corp.&amp;#39;s cement manufacturing plant in Martinsburg, West Virginia; Essroc Cement Corp.&amp;#39;s cement manufacturing plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania; Lehigh Cement&amp;#39;s cement manufacturing plant in Glen Falls, New York; Lehigh Cement&amp;#39;s cement manufacturing plant in Leeds, Alabama; and Marathon Petroleum Corporation&amp;#39;s Illinois Refining Division petroleum refinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the inception of EPA&amp;#39;s Energy Star certification, a total of 139 manufacturing plants have achieved this distinction. These plants have saved more than 530 trillion British thermal units in energy, which is equal to preventing more than 36 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and saving enough energy to provide the total yearly energy needs of approximately 3 million American households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EPA provides industry-specific Energy Star plant benchmarking tools to help industry measure energy performance. These are available or under development for more than 20 manufacturing sectors. Energy Star benchmarks enable companies to compare a plant&amp;#39;s energy performance against those of its industry and empower manufacturers to set informed improvement goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Energy-saving Tips for Plant Managers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/2/18/4f86d580-6122-48e2-ac37-2322bb66a6a8_energy-savings.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 290px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let today&amp;#39;s low oil prices fool you. They won&amp;#39;t last forever, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has little or no influence over natural gas or electricity. In fact, the closing of aging coal-generating power plants is expected to send electricity prices through the roof in many parts of the country in 2015 and 2016. The bottom line is that energy efficiency is as important as ever if you want to stay competitive in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here is a rundown of the five top areas that every plant manager should focus on when implementing energy-saving measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Process Heating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the U.S. Department of Energy, manufacturing plants can often reduce process-heating costs by up to 15 percent by implementing energy-saving measures and best practices. Process heating accounts for more than one-third of energy use in the manufacturing sector, so any savings in this area are sure to make a big impact. Your facility may benefit from monitoring and controlling your exhaust gases and air-to-fuel ratios, heat-transfer improvements, and waste-heat recovery technology. If your process requires large amounts of hot water, preheating your process water with a solar-water heating system could result in significant savings for your plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Motors and Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Machine drive represents more than 22 percent of energy end use in the manufacturing sector. By analyzing shaft and system losses and upgrading to higher efficiency systems, you can lower your total operating costs significantly. Sometimes this means replacing your equipment. However, not every upgrade requires a lot of capital. You may find that you can improve your plant&amp;#39;s mechanical performance simply by altering your maintenance or operation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Building-performance experts generally recognize lighting as the &amp;ldquo;low-hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; of energy savings. Energy-saving lighting options include daylighting through skylights and clerestories, high-efficiency fluorescent fixtures and bulbs, and the new LED tube lighting. Improving lighting efficiency doesn&amp;#39;t always mean replacing your entire lighting infrastructure. You may be able to convert your existing housings with one of the many retrofit kits on the market today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Utilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;#39;t overlook your utility providers as partners in energy savings. Review your current usage plans and contact them to see if they may be able to offer alternative procurement or demand-side management plans that might save you money. Many utilities also offer incentives for installing energy-saving improvements. Check with their competitors, too, and don&amp;#39;t be afraid to negotiate. You may find you can benefit from the competition between utility companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Employees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee behavior is a vital component in energy efficiency. Keep your employees informed about your energy-efficiency goals and progress, and recognize them for their role in supporting these initiatives. Above all, encourage them to share their ideas about how your facility can be more efficient. They are likely to surprise you with their insights, and you may even find that they exhibit a newfound pride in their work. In fact, studies repeatedly show that energy-efficiency upgrades typically make workers more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When planning an energy-efficiency program for your manufacturing plant, look first for low-cost or no-cost opportunities. Then, as your operating costs decrease, start investing in an improved energy infrastructure, such as a solar electric system, that will pay back big over time. With this approach, your energy-efficiency measures will help position your business competitively for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Post Record Efficiency Rates</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. nuclear energy facilities generated electricity at a record level of efficiency in 2014, demonstrating nuclear energy&amp;#39;s value to the reliability and stability of the electric grid and to the nation&amp;#39;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 100 nuclear power plants operating in 31 states posted an estimated average capacity factor of 91.9 percent, based on preliminary 2014 data compiled by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). That mark surpassed the industry&amp;#39;s prior record set in 2007. Capacity factor measures total electricity generated as a percentage of year-round potential generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Actual electricity production from nuclear energy facilities last year was the sixth-highest ever at an estimated 798.4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh). The industry&amp;#39;s record high electricity generation came in 2010, when the 104 reactors then operating produced 806.9 billion kWh of electricity while posting an industry average capacity factor of 90.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/29/c79d97c6-16ad-400e-8ff8-92e6cae42877_2014-Capacity-Factor-and-Generation-Tables.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 459px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The 2014 numbers show unequivocally how important well-performing nuclear energy is to America&amp;#39;s energy security, the economy and our quality of life,&amp;quot; said NEI president and chief executive officer Marvin Fertel. &amp;quot;Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the highly skilled men and women who work at these facilities, at the reactor vendors who provide support services, and in other capacities, U.S. nuclear power plants continue to operate at high levels of safety while generating affordable electricity that our society and our economy rely on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past two decades, U.S. nuclear energy facilities have produced about one-fifth of U.S. electricity supplies, even as total electricity demand has increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

	Sonoco&amp;#39;s flexible packaging facility in Waco, Texas, was recently named a gold sustainability star award recipient for its successful efforts to achieve landfill-free status. The plant becomes the first flexible packaging facility to achieve the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sustainability star award marks a milestone in the landfill-free efforts that have been underway since 2013. Since then, the Waco plant has diverted 90 to 100 tons per month away from the landfill. Half of that waste is recycled and converted to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;After the company announced its goal of taking 10 percent of its facilities landfill-free, we began efforts to eliminate the facility&amp;#39;s waste streams,&amp;quot; said Bob Puechl, Sunoco&amp;#39;s vice president of global flexible packaging. &amp;quot;The Waco team took on this challenge for the flexible division. Waco has proven we can become landfill-free even with a very difficult product mix.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Sonoco sustainability star awards program is comprised of three tiers: Gold recognizes facilities that have achieved 99-percent landfill diversion. Silver is awarded to facilities achieving 95-percent landfill diversion. Bronze recognizes facilities that have made significant waste-reduction achievements, such as drastically reducing their waste streams or implementing a new composting system.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Eaton Named to Climate Disclosure Leadership Index</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Power management company Eaton was recently named to the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) by environmental non-profit CDP. This marks the sixth year Eaton has received a position on the CDP&amp;#39;s S&amp;amp;P 500 CDLI in recognition of the depth and quality of its climate-change data disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;More than a responsibility, Eaton regards sustainability as fundamental to our business and pivotal to our future success,&amp;quot; said Harold Jones, Eaton&amp;#39;s senior vice president of environment, health and safety. &amp;quot;Our inclusion in the CDLI demonstrates the progress we&amp;#39;re making to be transparent in our effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water and energy consumption, and eliminate landfill waste.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eaton global facilities adhere to one set of standards, such as carbon emissions, energy and water consumption, and waste treatment, and are united to help customers manage power more efficiently and safely by deploying the company&amp;#39;s energy-efficient products and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The need for disclosure of corporate climate-change impacts and strategies to reduce them has never been greater,&amp;quot; said Paul Simpson, chief executive officer of CDP. &amp;quot;We congratulate those businesses that have achieved a position on CDP&amp;#39;s S&amp;amp;P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. These companies are responding to the ever-growing demand for environmental accountability and helping to inspire others to follow suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An international not-for-profit organization, CDP provides the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information. The organization works with market forces, including 767 institutional investors with assets of $92 trillion, to motivate companies to disclose their impacts on the environment and natural resources and to take action to reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How to Save Energy with Intelligent Lighting Systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/10/15/965920c2-b359-40be-866f-72a4e810dd7e_facility-image.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 445px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The world&amp;#39;s leading manufacturers have invested heavily in providing teams with every possible certification credential, which is testimony to the value placed on continuous improvement and operational efficiency. Whether ISO 900x, Six Sigma Black Belt or Total Quality Management (TQM), the accomplishments have been impressive. Moving forward, the challenge is to apply that same level of focus to ensuring that the buildings that host all of these finely tuned operations are just as sophisticated, efficient and productive, with similarly impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capital spending trends within the manufacturing industry suggest that facilities are, in fact, rapidly stepping up to this challenge by investing in energy efficiency and, more specifically, intelligent building technologies. Why? Because every dollar saved directly enhances bottom-line profitability, supports increasingly aggressive sustainability mandates emanating from corporate head offices and reduces dependency on an ever more costly and uncertain resource &amp;mdash; energy. Furthermore, these investments allow companies to show leadership in environmental stewardship, as members of the local and global communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dramatic reductions in energy use require intelligent building technologies, and intelligent light-emitting diode (LED) lighting is a textbook example. Designed from the ground up with the needs of industrial facilities in mind, intelligent LEDs leverage advanced sensing technologies, wireless networking and metered data to fundamentally change how lighting is being used, or not used, within a facility. By providing control over lighting delivery, intelligent LED systems can lead to energy savings that exceed traditional alternatives while offering better, safer, higher quality lighting and illumination levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, intelligent LEDs enabled a 292,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Sutton, Massachusetts, to reduce lighting-related energy use from 1.3 million kilowatt hours to less than 250,000 kilowatt hours annually. In addition, a German manufacturer of universal and high-capacity carding machines was able to achieve a 91-percent reduction in energy use by replacing &amp;quot;high efficiency&amp;quot; fluorescent fixtures. Likewise, a Connecticut-based contract manufacturer saw lighting-related energy savings of 90 percent within the first year, which was up from 75 percent at installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As extraordinary as the energy savings are, what is truly remarkable is the level of understanding facility managers have gained from the data, its impact on energy usage and visibility into operational patterns. For instance, lighting system occupancy data is being used to track the movement of goods within manufacturing facilities, driving the consolidation of materials into high-usage spaces, shortening transit times and improving space utilization. Others are using lighting data to track machinery utilization rates, enabling the optimization of production and maintenance schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With this intelligent network in place, facility managers are also finding ways to leverage intelligent LED investments to monitor non-lighting-related energy loads, such as HVAC systems and production line machinery. Connecting any piece of equipment to the system provides detailed energy usage and performance data via the same energy and analysis platform used to manage lighting. In this way, intelligent lighting systems give facility managers a familiar, trusted resource for managing energy resources facility-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without question, intelligent building technologies are changing how facility managers think about energy. Rather than viewing energy usage as an uncontrollable cost of doing business, they are now managing it as a valuable asset that can be optimized to meet organizational needs while saving massive amounts of energy. Leading manufacturers have accomplished this by elevating the importance of energy management to the same level placed on improving other business processes and procedures. Based on proven results from intelligent LED deployments, they are now expecting more from their infrastructure investments, with the expectation of even greater success moving forward.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/aIL-hfFTu3o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>EPA Honors Freight Carriers for Supply Chain Efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently honored 44 truck and multi-modal carriers as industry leaders in supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency with its 2014 SmartWay Excellence Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These carrier partners are SmartWay&amp;#39;s top environmental performers, setting benchmarks in how they move products and supplies, by transporting goods efficiently with the lowest overall carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As SmartWay celebrates its 10th anniversary, EPA recognizes its top carrier partners for the significant strides they have made toward a sustainable transportation future,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. &amp;quot;By saving fuel and keeping carbon dioxide and harmful pollutants out of the air, recipients of the SmartWay Excellence Award demonstrate that fighting climate change and protecting human health is good for business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SmartWay program, which is a public-private partnership between the EPA and transportation-related companies, empowers businesses to move goods in the cleanest, most energy-efficient way possible while protecting public health and reducing the impact of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2004, SmartWay partners have saved $16.8 billion in fuel costs and 120.7 million barrels of oil &amp;mdash; the equivalent of taking more than 10 million cars off the road for an entire year. SmartWay&amp;#39;s clean air achievements have also protected the well-being of citizens by avoiding emissions of 51.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 738,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 37,000 tons of particulate matter.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ProcessBarron Helps Steel Plant Save Big, Earn $2.5 Million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Last year, ProcessBarron retrofitted four 2,750-horsepower fans that draft heavy dust-laden gases from an electric arc furnace (EAF) to a baghouse for air pollution control at the Severstal steel plant in Columbus, Miss. These retrofits helped the plant achieve more than 25 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per year in energy savings and reduced the plant&amp;#39;s EAF energy costs by $0.70 per ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These results qualified the steel plant for the Tennessee Valley Authority&amp;#39;s Major Industrial Program, which, along with the state of Mississippi, awarded Severstal more than $2.5 million for the plant&amp;#39;s reduction in electricity consumption in October 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since October, ProcessBarron&amp;#39;s air-handling system retrofits have produced significant savings thanks to increased wear resistance, reduced maintenance costs and more reliable operation. Fan maintenance costs are down 80 percent at the steel plant, and the on-budget, on-time project is set to deliver a return on investment (ROI) in the projected timeframe of less than two years. In addition, carbon dioxide (C02) emissions at the steel plant have been reduced by 30,000 tons per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To engineer the cost-saving and emissions-reducing designs, ProcessBarron conducted a thorough field performance assessment. A computational fluid dynamics study was conducted to predict wear patterns, allowing ProcessBarron to incrementally optimize the design to control wear and improve rotor life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Tennessee Valley Authority&amp;#39;s Major Industrial Program was developed to encourage reductions in electric energy use by large industrial facilities that have 5 megawatts or more of contract demand. Plants that qualify for the program and that complete a project to reduce electric energy consumption will be awarded a lump sum of $0.10 per kWh on first-year savings or 70 percent of the project cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Pelham, Ala., ProcessBarron is a leader in the design, manufacturing, installation and repair of air, gas, fuel and ash handling equipment for a variety of heavy industrial applications.

            <title>Honeywell to Improve Energy Efficiency at Fort Bragg</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honeywell recently announced a $3.4-million project to help improve energy security and surety at Fort Bragg, N.C. The company will build a microgrid that uses advance controls to network new and existing backup generators on the U.S. Army post, the first application of this technology for a federal agency. The electricity these assets produce will then be available across multiple buildings, helping maintain power for vital operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Department of Defense (DOD) will finance the project through its Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP), which identifies and demonstrates innovative, cost-effective technologies that address the department&amp;#39;s energy and environmental requirements. Along with the microgrid grant, DOD selected Honeywell for a second ESTCP-funded project, work that will help trim expenses tied to the post&amp;#39;s central heating and cooling plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Sites such as Fort Bragg present unique challenges due to the nature of their operations,&amp;quot; said Paul Orzeske, president of Honeywell Building Solutions. &amp;quot;They can&amp;#39;t lose power, but at the same time, they may be using too much power. Honeywell&amp;#39;s expertise in managing energy supply and demand allows us to develop solutions that help address both issues.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fort Bragg has traditionally used emergency generators to make sure electricity is available for mission-critical activities. These generators, however, are not usually shared between facilities, which means there&amp;#39;s no backup to the backup power if there is a failure or maintenance issue. The equipment is often improperly sized as well, leading to inefficient operations and higher than necessary expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With Honeywell&amp;#39;s Secured Network of Assured Power Enclaves (SNAPE), Fort Bragg expects to share emergency generation between multiple buildings and decrease overall energy use by requiring fewer generators to address energy interruptions. Additionally, the post will leverage its existing assets, helping reduce capital costs while bolstering security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By connecting the microgrid to the main electrical grid, Fort Bragg should also be able to respond automatically to signals from its utility and temporarily reduce consumption when overall energy use spikes and strains the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Many organizations are forced to choose between improving efficiency or improving energy security,&amp;quot; said Greg Bean, director of public works at Fort Bragg. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s been challenging to tackle both at once. However, with this project we will be able to enhance the reliability of our current generation capacity and utilize it in a far more cost- and energy-efficient way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honeywell is also helping optimize Fort Bragg&amp;#39;s central plant to reduce energy use. Under the second ESTCP grant, engineers will integrate predictive technology designed to cut consumption and costs by controlling the generation and distribution of cooling and heating energy and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Construction for both projects is expected to be complete in early 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Illinois Manufacturer Turns on the Light to Energy Savings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/28/79678bec-af3f-453d-b999-9ee6183b963f_TRP Manufacturing Image-1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;What do you do when you move your manufacturing and main distribution center into a new facility, and your business is built on providing key components to manufacturers of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting? Put your money where your mouth is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thomas Research Products (TRP) is a leading provider of LED drivers in North America, along with LED light engines, surge protectors for lighting and energy-saving lighting controls. The company&amp;#39;s main distribution center is located at its corporate headquarters where it maintains one of the nation&amp;rsquo;s larger inventories. The facility also houses the main production line for many of its controls, including its lighting surge-protector products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2014 when TRP prepared to move into a larger 48,000-square-foot facility in Elgin, Ill., the move presented an opportunity to relight the facility with LED luminaires. The existing lighting in the manufacturing, warehouse and shipping areas consisted of metal halide high-bay fixtures. Each luminaire was almost 20 years old and consumed 458 watts, which meant a lot of energy dollars were spent on lighting the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Project Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vice president Greg Andrews started looking at options to change out the old lighting. He had experience overseeing a lighting overhaul at TRP&amp;#39;s previous facility three years earlier. He began by measuring the existing light in the Elgin facility before the company took possession of the building. The quality of the light reaching the floor was low with uneven distribution. His primary goals for the project would be maximizing energy savings, increasing light levels and improving the distribution of the light while reducing maintenance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Andrews could have chosen a fluorescent high-bay solution. At 218 watts per fixture, this would have saved 240 watts each. However, that was not as effective as an LED solution. One of TRP&amp;#39;s customers is Precision-Paragon Lighting (P2). P2 general manager Joe Martin suggested Andrews consider one of his company&amp;rsquo;s LED high-bay luminaires that uses only 132 watts. This would result in saving more than 325 watts per fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The design of the P2 fixture also provides for long life, with a 95-percent lumen maintenance of greater than 60,000 hours. Since the manufacturing area in the facility runs two shifts, these fixtures could operate more than seven years with no visible degradation in light levels. The P2 luminaire also utilizes an LED driver from TRP with universal voltage input, so no step-down transformer was needed to connect the fixtures to the existing 277-volt circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Making Sense of Occupancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Andrews was also conscious of even greater energy savings potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The best way to save money is to turn them off, so we chose to use the best occupancy sensors money can buy,&amp;quot; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The P2 fixture&amp;rsquo;s high-bay design accepts an optional occupancy sensor. This lighting control uses passive infrared technology to provide simple on/off control and includes a daylight sensor for when there is sufficient natural light. Andrews chose to have the sensor installed on each fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Early on in this project, some people questioned installing occupancy sensors on luminaires in manufacturing. Andrews was not concerned because of the company&amp;#39;s previous retrofit experience. He knew that people move enough during production that the lights stay on as needed. The sensors switch the fixtures off and on more often in the warehouse where there are less people working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Optics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/5/28/96c09030-4825-42d9-90c7-3e62a0c3f208_TRP Warehouse Image-3.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Because the LED luminaires would be used in areas with very different functions, Andrews chose optics appropriate for each area. For 30 fixtures in the warehouse, an &amp;quot;aisle lighter&amp;quot; optic was installed. This asymmetric lens design offers higher vertical footcandles and more uniform light down the racking aisles. For the fixtures to be installed in manufacturing and shipping, an open area optic provides maximum 360-degree area coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Rebate Savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The electrical needs of the facility in Elgin, Ill., are served by Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison. The utility offers rebates to commercial customers, which made the retrofit installation financially attractive as well. The high efficiency of the chosen fixture qualified for an incentive of $0.50 per watt reduced. The occupancy sensors also qualified for an additional incentive of $0.12 per watt controlled by the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In total, 100 LED luminaires were used in a one-for-one replacement of the original fixtures. The units were mounted at 20 feet above the floor, lighting almost 35,000 square feet of the building. Light levels were now double the original measurements. The distribution of the light was also much more uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although the design of the P2 fixture does not provide any uplight, painting the walls produced enough reflectivity to prevent the ceiling from being too dark. In the manufacturing area, the ceiling and floor were also painted, creating additional reflectivity. The building already had a number of skylights in both key areas, so daylight also provides light during primary business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of the project have been well-received by employees and visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Yes, I&amp;#39;m pleased,&amp;quot; Andrews said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s amazing how far the technology has come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this LED driver manufacturer, the move not only provided an opportunity to save energy and improve the quality of the light, but it also created an effective showcase for their own product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/m1YThaP1qhw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lehigh Hanson Plant Achieves Energy Star Recognition</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lehigh Hanson Inc. recently announced that its aggregates plant in Downingtown, Pa., has achieved the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;#39;s (EPA&amp;#39;s) Energy Star Challenge for Industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Downingtown plant, which has reduced its energy intensity by 10.7 percent within two years, becomes the third Lehigh Hanson aggregates facility to earn the Energy Star Challenge for Industry in the past two years. The company also has the unique distinction of being the only aggregates producer to have any of its facilities achieve this recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are extremely proud of achieving the Energy Star Challenge for Industry,&amp;quot; said Randy Miles, plant manager at the Downingtown facility. &amp;quot;By really digging into the processes that used the most energy, we were able to develop and implement a reduction plan that focused on optimizing energy usage at every stage of production.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Star Challenge is a national call-to-action to improve energy efficiency of America&amp;#39;s commercial and industrial buildings by 10 percent or more. The EPA estimates that the U.S. manufacturing industry is responsible for nearly 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and spends almost $100 billion annually on energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the umbrella of the Energy Star Challenge for Industry, the EPA is working with individual manufacturing sites and their parent companies to fight climate change through improvements in energy efficiency. Lehigh Hanson currently has eight additional aggregate facilities participating in the Energy Star Challenge for Industry and expects more of its plants to join the program in the near future. The company operates more than 200 aggregates plants in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lehigh Hanson&amp;#39;s Downingtown plant was able to reduce its energy intensity by taking a hands-on approach to assessing the facility&amp;#39;s energy consumption and developing an ambitious but realistic strategy to achieve its reduction goal. Plant management, with support from personnel at the company&amp;#39;s technical competency center in Irving, Texas, completed a comprehensive review of the major systems at the plant, including crushers, conveyors, pumps, screens, feeders, fans, heating, air compressors, etc. Based on their findings, a number of energy-related projects were planned and implemented. The projects concentrated on optimizing the pumping systems, demand management strategies, minimizing parasitic loads, as well as process improvements. The plant shifted certain production tasks to reduce loads at peak demand times and set monthly demand control targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Energy efficiency is a key aspect of Lehigh Hanson&amp;#39;s overall sustainability strategy,&amp;quot; said Tom Chizmadia, senior vice president of government affairs, public relations and sustainability. &amp;quot;Programs such as the EPA&amp;#39;s Energy Star Challenge for Industry provide our operations management teams with additional tools and resources to help identify areas for improving energy efficiency by managing energy strategically.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nissan Wins Third Energy Star Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/10/8793cde9-64f0-4cbd-ab27-9eb1b200a901_nissan-CL99858.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 208px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Nissan North America Inc. recently received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;#39;s 2014 Energy Star Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award in recognition of continued improvement of its energy management performance. This marks the third consecutive year that Nissan has won the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the top Energy Star award, the Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award is given to organizations to recognize their commitment to becoming increasingly more energy efficient. Award winners are selected from 16,000 organizations that participate in the Energy Star program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan&amp;#39;s work with Energy Star aligns with the company&amp;#39;s sustainability strategy, the Nissan Green Program, and its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint 20 percent by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2013, the Nissan energy management team repaired enough compressed air system leaks in its U.S. manufacturing facilities to save 11,300 megawatt hours of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We saved enough energy to power more than 700 homes for a year, offset the greenhouse gas emissions of nearly 2,800 tons of landfill waste or better yet, to drive the all-electric Nissan Leaf around the earth more than 40,000 times,&amp;quot; said John Martin, Nissan senior vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Nissan team estimated that more than 20 percent of compressed air used in manufacturing operations was wasted through air leaks at Nissan&amp;#39;s manufacturing facilities in Smyrna and Decherd, Tenn., and Canton, Miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team also learned how to catch a ray of sunlight to use it for lighting in the Nissan Decherd Powertrain Assembly Plant. This daylight harvesting technique allows for more optimal lighting inside the plant while using substantially less energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The energy management team also identified inefficiencies in Nissan&amp;#39;s former paint plant at its vehicle assembly facility in Smyrna, which led to the installation of the company&amp;#39;s most advanced paint plant. By using an innovative three-wet paint process that applies all three paint layers in succession before the vehicle goes into the oven, the new paint plant uses 30 percent less energy during the paint process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan also hosted 10 organizations including other Energy Star partners, suppliers and local government officials at its facility in Decherd, Tenn., where leaders shared best practices for energy management. Through those discussions, participants identified energy-saving ideas that could potentially save up to $1.5 million in energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Eaton Unveils 2013 Power Outage Data</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Eaton recently released its Blackout Tracker Annual Report for 2013. For the fifth consecutive year, California topped the list of states with the most power outages, followed by Texas and Michigan. On average, 6,543 people were affected for more than three hours per outage in 2013, and power failures caused problems for people and businesses in all 50 states. The average length of an outage was 86 minutes, resulting in an average cost per incident of approximately $690,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it comes to the cause of unplanned outages, 83 percent of respondents were able to point to a specific source, citing the most frequent root causes as uninterruptible power system (UPS) battery failure (55 percent), UPS capacity exceeded (46 percent) and accidental human error (48 percent). Of those surveyed, 52 percent believe all or most of the unplanned outages could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Blackout Tracker Annual Report illustrates the scope and severity of power outages across the country and the serious consequences that can arise for businesses when the lights go out,&amp;quot; said Mike DeCamp, senior marketing communications manager for Eaton&amp;#39;s Power Quality Division. &amp;quot;With electrical power outages, surges and spikes estimated to cost the U.S. economy $150 billion, it&amp;#39;s more important than ever for companies of all sizes to invest in reliable power backup solutions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Blackout Tracker data is based on a full year of reported power outages across the United States. Overall, 3,236 reported outages were used as the basis for the 2013 report, representing an increase of about 15 percent from the 2,808 outages reported in 2012. The reported number of people affected by outages decreased from 25 million in 2012 to 14 million in 2013. However, complete data is often unavailable on certain aspects of reported outages, including the number of people affected and the duration of the blackout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eaton&amp;#39;s annual report also features &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; outage lists, including the most significant reported outages, largest data center outages and the most unusual causes for outages. Among the most unusual causes of power outages in 2013 included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On May 10, a man in Washington&amp;#39;s Clallam County was so mad at his neighbors that he went on a rampage with a bulldozer. He damaged four homes, knocked over a 70-foot pole and cut power to thousands of people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On June 7, a runaway trash truck rolled down the street in Naugatuck, Conn., and smashed into a utility pole after the driver exited to take a phone call, damaging the truck and knocking out power.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On Dec. 9, wild parrots roosting on an overhead line in Redondo Beach, Calif., knocked out power to more than 6,100 customers for three hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Illustrating the importance of reliable backup power, even the White House weighed in on the severity of blackouts in 2013, releasing a report showing that outages caused by harsh weather cost the U.S. economy an average of $18 billion to $33 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data for Eaton&amp;#39;s annual report is based on reports from news services, newspapers, websites and personal accounts.

            <title>5 Holcim Plants Earn EPA's Energy Star</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim (US) Inc. recently announced that five of its plants have earned the prestigious Energy Star award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim plants in Holly Hill, S.C., Bloomsdale, Mo., and Theodore, Ala., are receiving the award for the fourth time. The Devil&amp;#39;s Slide plant in Morgan, Utah, has earned its sixth consecutive award from the EPA, while the Portland plant in Florence, Colo., has been honored for three consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Holcim&amp;#39;s receipt of this award for five of its plants is a testament to the commitment that our management team and employees have made to protect the environment,&amp;quot; said Filiberto Ruiz, president and CEO of Holcim (US). &amp;quot;Sustainability is a core component of Holcim&amp;#39;s corporate values, and it is a priority at every plant and facility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Star is the national symbol for protecting the environment through superior energy performance. The EPA&amp;#39;s national energy performance rating system provides a 1 to 100 scale that helps organizations assess how efficiently their facilities use energy relative to similar facilities nationwide. A cement plant that scores a rating of 75 or higher and meets all other official EPA requirements is eligible for the Energy Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A subsidiary of Holcim Ltd., Holcim (US) Inc. is a leading manufacturer and supplier of cement and mineral components. It has approximately 1,800 employees and operates 12 manufacturing plants and more than 50 distribution facilities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Reduces Oil and Water Usage with Dry-Machining Technology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. recently announced that it has added dry-machining capability to six of its plants globally and will nearly double that number in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Near-dry machining, also known as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), is a process that lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil exactly when and where it is needed. In comparison, conventional wet machining floods the part with metalworking fluids, requiring large amounts of fluid to cool and lubricate the tools used to make engines and transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. The Cologne Engine Plant in Germany decreased water use per engine by 50 percent from 2011 to 2012 by switching to the MQL process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Reducing the environmental footprint of our plants is a critical part of Ford&amp;#39;s overall sustainability commitment,&amp;quot; said Andrew Hobbs, director of Ford&amp;#39;s environmental quality office. &amp;quot;Expanding new processes such as MQL across our global network of facilities allows us to have an even greater impact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MQL also reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more. Without the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL also helps to reduce energy use. While conventional wet machining produces an airborne mist, MQL eliminates that mist, improving air quality in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plants that have switched to the MQL process include the Livonia Transmission Plant in Michigan, the Changan Ford Engine Plant in China, the Romeo Engine Plant in Michigan, the Craiova Engine Plant in Romania, the Cologne Engine Plant in Germany and the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;MQL technology will also be incorporated into future engine and transmission plants, underscoring our commitment to advanced manufacturing processes that reduce water and resource requirements,&amp;quot; said Bill Russo, director of manufacturing for Ford powertrain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford continues to work toward cutting water use 30 percent per vehicle by 2015. Between 2000 and 2012, Ford reduced global water use by 62 percent &amp;ndash; about 10 billion gallons.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Johns Manville Plant Reduces Energy Costs with Lighting Improvements</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Johns Manville (JM) recently earned a $68,554 rebate check from Energizing Indiana, Richmond Power and Light (RP&amp;amp;L) and the Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA) for implementing energy-efficient lighting improvements to its Richmond Insulation Systems facility. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rebate is the largest issued thus far to any of IMPA&amp;#39;s 59 member communities involved in the Energizing Indiana Commercial and Industrial Prescriptive Rebate Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;IMPA, along with our partners at Energizing Indiana and Richmond Power and Light, are very pleased to recognize the efforts of Johns Manville,&amp;quot; said Raj Rao, IMPA president and CEO. &amp;quot;Their commitment to reducing energy sets an example that we all can follow and highlights how energy efficiency should be a priority for all of us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The retrofit project cut the facility&amp;#39;s lighting energy consumption by approximately 80 percent and reduced annual greenhouse gas emissions by more than 4 million pounds of carbon dioxide, more than 20,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide and approximately 5,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This retrofit project provides a reduction in energy usage that helps the utility curtail the need to add capacity to the grid,&amp;quot; said Zane Carpenter, Johns Manville manager of energy engineering. &amp;quot;It helps reduce greenhouse gas emission derived from electricity production; it helps the community by injecting money into the economy and putting people to work, including the lighting designers, manufacturers and local contractors; and it helps the business maintain a healthy bottom line by reducing overall operating costs. It&amp;#39;s really a win for the company, the community, the utility and the environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Johns Manville retrofitted lighting throughout its entire facility, including manufacturing, warehouse operations, all office spaces and building exterior. The project replaced high-bay fixtures with linear fluorescent lights equipped with in-line quick-connect devices that allow for quick fixture removal without disrupting operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Individual occupancy controls were installed throughout the retrofit to automatically turn off fixtures when the space is not occupied. In areas of abundant natural light, a combination of ambient light and occupancy sensor controls turn off primary fixtures when natural light is present or no occupancy is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the office and basement areas as well as for task lighting, lamp and ballast systems were retrofitted with kits or replaced with fixtures. A range of controls including individual fixture occupancy sensors, wall switch-mounted occupancy sensors for select private offices or area sensors for common office areas were also installed. In addition, incandescent exit signs were replaced with new LED signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Because we produce energy-saving products at our Richmond facility, it only makes sense that we&amp;#39;d want to reduce energy usage as well as our carbon footprint here,&amp;quot; said JM&amp;#39;s Richmond plant manager Joe Ehrenreich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A manufacturer and marketer of premium-quality products for building insulation, mechanical insulation, commercial roofing and roof insulation, as well as fibers and nonwovens for commercial, industrial and residential applications, Johns Manville serves markets that include aerospace, automotive and transportation, air handling, appliance, HVAC, pipe and equipment, filtration, waterproofing, building, flooring, interiors and wind energy. The Denver-based company has annual sales of approximately $2.5 billion and operates 45 manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and China, employing approximately 7,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cummins Plant Earns ISO Certification </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/8/6/398c040d-92c7-4566-a7f8-93ae9505145e_CumminsEnginePlant.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 233px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;Cummins Inc. recently announced that its Columbus Engine Plant (CEP) in Columbus, Ind., has earned ISO 50001 energy-management system certification, becoming one of only a few manufacturing sites in the United States and the first Cummins facility to achieve this international accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Designing and implementing the processes for the ISO 50001 standard have taken a focused effort from many people,&amp;quot; said Cummins&amp;#39; Jeff Caldwell. &amp;quot;We believe the energy savings at CEP will be important to our future cost and resource effectiveness, and our certification will help serve as a model for other Cummins plants to follow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Columbus Engine Plant has implemented a number of energy improvements in recent years, including replacing 4,000 metal halide light fixtures with high-efficiency fluorescent fixtures, substituting efficient direct-fired air-handling units for steam heat, improving building insulation and increasing air-compressor efficiency. Implementation of the energy-management system will drive additional energy-improvement projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Launched in 2011, ISO 50001 includes internationally recognized requirements for effective energy-management systems. It is the Columbus Engine Plant&amp;rsquo;s fourth certification. The plant has also attained ISO/TS 16949 for quality management, ISO 14001 for environmental management and OHSAS 18001 for health and safety management.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Volkswagen Plant Earns Engineering Excellence Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Volkswagen assembly plant in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Chattanooga, Tenn., &lt;/span&gt;recently earned one of eight grand awards for engineering excellence at the 47th Annual Engineering Excellence Awards. The award was presented to Volkswagen and SSOE Group representatives at an awards gala in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Washington D.C&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Sponsored by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), the Engineering Excellence Awards are chosen by a panel of judges representing industry, government, academia and media. Projects throughout the world are rated on the basis of uniqueness and innovative applications; future value to the engineering profession; perception by the public; social, economic and sustainable development considerations; complexity; and successful fulfillment of the client&amp;rsquo;s/owner&amp;#39;s needs, including schedule and budget. The panel selects 24 award winners, with 16 honor awards and eight grand awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Along with its Engineering Excellence Award, the Volkswagen assembly plant has received a platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council&amp;#39;s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification program, becoming the only LEED platinum automotive manufacturing plant in the world, the first LEED platinum industrial campus in the U.S. and the largest platinum project in the U.S. (based on building area).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility was built on a 1,350-acre brownfield site and incorporates several innovative methods to lessen its environmental impact. The building is able to save 42 percent of the energy consumed from both the manufacturing process and building facilities. The plant also uses rain water to reduce water usage by 653,000 gallons per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, roller-compacted concrete was chosen in lieu of asphalt in many areas, and a white roof with a high albedo was utilized throughout all buildings in order to minimize the heat-island effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Air-handling equipment was designed with heat-recovery wheels, which allow the reuse of heat energy prior to releasing it into the atmosphere. Skylights ensure natural lighting throughout the facility, reducing the energy demand from light fixtures. LED lighting was selected for the exterior, which uses 68 percent less energy than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honeywell Cuts Energy Use at Puerto Rican Wastewater Treatment Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honeywell recently announced an agreement to upgrade wastewater treatment plants for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA), the largest water and wastewater utility in &lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;North America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	The energy-saving program will start with $16.3 million in improvements at treatment plants in Barceloneta and Caguas, &lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This includes installing advanced process controls, new blowers and diffusers, and other high-efficiency equipment, which will save the authority almost $2.7 million in annual energy and operating costs. In addition to the equipment upgrades, Honeywell will provide ongoing service and maintenance to ensure the new technology operates effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	The enhancements are expected to cut energy use at the Barceloneta plant in half and the Caguas plant by nearly 30 percent. Combined, PRASA will reduce its electricity consumption by an estimated 9.3 million kilowatt-hours annually, which is enough to power more than 790 homes on average. It will also trim carbon-dioxide emissions by approximately 6,100 metric tons each year, which is equivalent to removing almost 1,200 cars from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Honeywell is also auditing five other PRASA sites to identify opportunities to cut energy consumption and costs, which could deliver more than $3 million in additional savings per year. The authority will use the savings from the program to pay for the upgrades. As a result, PRASA should be able to modernize its operations without increasing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	&amp;quot;In an area where electricity costs are high and energy use comes at a premium, improving efficiency is a top priority,&amp;quot; said PRASA president Alberto L&amp;aacute;zaro. &amp;quot;Working with Honeywell will significantly enhance our plants and ability to manage consumption.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	The program is also expected to create jobs for local contractors, which Honeywell plans to hire to complete many of the upgrades. According to figures from the National Association of Energy Service Companies, the initial projects have the potential to create or sustain more than 150 high-paying jobs for the businesses involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	&amp;quot;Scaling back energy use and increasing efficiency at the plant level improves service quality and enables greater flexibility,&amp;quot; said &lt;span itemprop="name"&gt;&lt;span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"&gt;Paul Orzeske&lt;/span&gt;, president of Honeywell Building Solutions. &amp;quot;By focusing on modernizing its infrastructure and equipment, it is clear &lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is committed to providing superior water and wastewater treatment to its residents in a fiscally and environmentally responsible way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	As part of the first phase of improvements, Honeywell will rebuild the aeration and aerobic digestion systems at both the Barceloneta and Caguas plants. Additional changes include replacing old water pumps, transformers and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Honeywell will also improve the efficiency of the sludge-removal systems at the facilities, which treat more than 20 million gallons of water a day, increasing the amount of waste captured and minimizing disposal costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	The company expects to complete the upgrades by early 2014 and will begin work at the other sites as soon as the audits and conservation measures are finalized.

            <title>Honda Plant to Use Wind Energy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Juhl Wind Inc. recently announced an agreement with Honda Transmission Manufacturing of America Inc. to develop, install and operate two utility-scale wind turbines that will generate electricity for the plant in Russell&amp;#39;s Point, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the turbines begin operating later this year, the Honda Transmission plant will be the first major automotive manufacturing facility in the United States to obtain a substantial amount of its electricity directly from wind turbines located on its property. The turbines, with blades approximately 160 feet long, will be installed on 260-foot towers on the Honda property, which is suited for a maximum of two wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Juhl Wind is supplying full development services along with construction management of the $8-million project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Juhl will also provide ongoing operation of the turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An evaluation of the project showed that renewable energy from the two wind turbines will supply approximately 10 percent of the plant&amp;#39;s electricity, while also reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. Studies commissioned by Honda Transmission indicated that wind-generated power is a cost-effective source of electricity for the plant, and that the project will not adversely impact local wildlife or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is just one of many ways that Honda is seeking to reduce our environmental footprint, and we appreciate the experience and knowledge that Juhl Wind is bringing to this unique wind-generation project,&amp;quot; said Honda Transmission vice president Gary Hand. &amp;quot;In our own ways, both Honda and Juhl are committed to reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Globally, Honda has established voluntary goals to reduce the environmental impact of its products and manufacturing operations by 2020. This includes a 30-percent reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions from Honda products and significant carbon-dioxide reductions from the company&amp;#39;s plants and other operations, compared with 2000 levels. To achieve these new environmental targets, Honda is accelerating its efforts to advance the environmental performance of its products and operations throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SC Johnson Adds Wind Turbines at Wisconsin Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SC Johnson recently added two new wind turbines at its Waxdale manufacturing facility located in Mount Pleasant, Wis., marking another step in the company&amp;#39;s goal of increasing worldwide renewable energy use to 44 percent of total electricity by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of wind power means that the facility is now able to produce an average of 100 percent of its electrical energy on-site, reducing carbon emissions associated with powering Waxdale by 6,000 metric tons annually. Each 415-foot turbine features a permanent magnet, gearless generator, which requires less maintenance but produces higher energy yields than the more traditional gearbox-type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;SC Johnson has been making green choices for our products and operations for decades,&amp;quot; said Fisk Johnson, chairman and CEO of SC Johnson. &amp;quot;Waxdale&amp;#39;s new wind turbines enable us to manufacture our products while having an even smaller impact on the environment &amp;ndash; and that&amp;#39;s something the people of SC Johnson are very proud of. The turbines are yet another symbol of our commitment to future generations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Waxdale plant, which is the size of 36 football fields, is SC Johnson&amp;#39;s largest manufacturing facility and home to additional clean energy initiatives. In the mid-2000s, two cogeneration systems were put in place that use waste methane gas from a nearby public landfill and clean-burning natural gas to generate 85 percent of the facility&amp;#39;s electrical energy. The new wind turbines will provide the remaining 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2000, SC Johnson has also worked to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 26 percent. In Bay City, Mich., nearly half of the electricity needed to operate the company&amp;#39;s plant now comes from off-site wind power. SC Johnson currently is researching on-site projects to increase the use of clean energy there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the SC Johnson plant in Medan, Indonesia, waste palm shells are used as a replacement for diesel fuel. It transfers a waste product back into the value chain with minimal impact and has reduced local diesel fuel use by 80 percent. It also cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In May 2012, the company launched a new biofuel initiative at its factory in Surabaya, Indonesia, using waste husks from rice grains as a fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several solar projects are also helping provide hot-water heating for SC Johnson&amp;#39;s facility in Shanghai, China. One provides hot water for food service and other office needs. Solar-heated waste water from the facility&amp;#39;s steam piping network aids aerosol production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to these energy-saving efforts, SC Johnson is also working toward becoming landfill neutral by 2016. Through operational commitments, the company expects to eliminate or divert more than 480 million pounds of waste from the nation&amp;#39;s landfills, which is equivalent to more than its U.S. waste footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leading manufacturer of household cleaning products and products for home storage, air care and insect control, SC Johnson employs nearly 13,000 people globally and sells products in virtually every country around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Holcim Plants Earn EPA's Energy Star</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim (US) Inc. recently announced that five of its plants have earned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;#39;s (EPA) prestigious Energy Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is with great pride that once again Holcim is recognized by the EPA for our continued commitment to environmentally sound practices with the Energy Star awards,&amp;quot; said Filiberto Ruiz, deputy chief executive officer of Holcim (US). &amp;quot;Protecting the environment is a priority at Holcim, and these awards reflect the determination of every Holcim employee to maintain that commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The five Holcim plants honored were Theodore in Theodore, Ala.; Ste. Genevieve in Bloomsdale, Mo.; Holly Hill in Holly Hill, S.C.; Portland in Florence, Colo.; and Devil&amp;#39;s Slide in Morgan, Utah. This year&amp;#39;s award is the second for the Portland plant, the third for both the Holly Hill and Ste. Genevieve plants, and the fifth consecutive year for the Devil&amp;#39;s Slide plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Star is the national symbol for protecting the environment through superior energy performance. EPA&amp;#39;s national energy performance rating system provides a 1 to 100 scale that helps organizations assess how efficiently their facilities use energy relative to similar facilities nationwide. A cement plant that scores a rating of 75 or higher and meets all other official EPA requirements is eligible for the Energy Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A subsidiary of Holcim Ltd., Holcim (US) Inc. is one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading manufacturers and suppliers of cement and mineral components with approximately 1,800 employees, 12 manufacturing plants and more than 50 distribution facilities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>EPA Honors Freight Companies with SmartWay Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently honored 40 companies in the freight industry with the 2012 SmartWay Excellence Awards for achievements in moving freight more efficiently while reducing carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2004, SmartWay partners have benefited from $6.5 billion in fuel savings while strengthening U.S. energy independence by saving 55 million barrels of oil. The SmartWay Excellence Award winners have proven that it is possible to move more goods over more miles with lower emissions, less energy and at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Recipients of this year&amp;#39;s SmartWay Excellence Awards are reaping the business benefits and environmental rewards of cutting petroleum use in their transportation operations,&amp;quot; said Gina McCarthy of the Office of Air and Radiation. &amp;quot;By participating in EPA&amp;#39;s SmartWay Transport Partnership and working to reduce costs and emissions, these companies are moving our nation forward to a healthier and more secure future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The winning organizations are leaders in reducing freight transportation emissions through technological innovation and are taking advantage of SmartWay strategies and tools. The EPA launched SmartWay in 2004 to help improve the freight industry&amp;rsquo;s environmental performance. SmartWay&amp;rsquo;s clean-air achievements include reducing 23.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 478,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 22,000 tons of particulate matter to help protect the health and environment of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SmartWay was recently upgraded to include enhanced reporting tools that enable industry to track freight operations&amp;#39; energy and environmental efficiency. In addition to carriers having the ability to both calculate and adopt strategies for lowering their transportation energy use and carbon emissions, shipper and logistics partners are now able to optimize their carriers and mode selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2012 SmartWay Excellence Award recognition was held in conjunction with the American Trucking Association&amp;rsquo;s Management Conference and Exhibition in Las Vegas, Nev., and the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals&amp;rsquo; annual conference in Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Carton Companies Reduce Energy Costs with Efficient Lighting</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Independent Carton Group (ICG) recently announced that its members have collectively saved more than $1.8 million in electricity costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 18.1 million pounds annually by implementing energy-efficient lighting solutions in their manufacturing facilities, warehouses and offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The association of 17 independently owned and operated folding carton companies worked with Efficient Lighting Consultants (ELC) to create a custom energy-efficiency program, which included auditing energy consumption, devising conservation strategies, leveraging energy incentives and employing technologies that provide for the immediate reduction of energy usage while remaining within members&amp;#39; current utility budgets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In addition to considerable environmental and cost-saving benefits, many of our members have told us that the new lighting reflects true colors better and provides for improved color matching,&amp;quot; said Andy Willie, president of the Independent Carton Group. &amp;quot;Since we know our members work closely with color matching in the manufacture of folding cartons, we&amp;#39;ve been very pleased to hear about this ancillary benefit of the program.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ICG members&amp;#39; collective annual savings of more than $1.8 million is the result of more than 16.4 million kilowatt hours of electricity being saved each year.&amp;nbsp;This is equivalent to more than 8.4 million pounds of coal and nearly 1.1 million gallons of oil not burned, or the amount of fossil fuels needed to provide 1,976 homes with electricity for one year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ICG members have also helped reduce air pollution and improve air quality by decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful environmental pollutants.&amp;nbsp;Gas emissions avoided annually include 33,383 pounds of sulfur oxides, 8,906 pounds of nitrogen oxides and more than 18 million pounds of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honeywell Builds Renewable Energy Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honeywell recently announced a $35-million renewable energy project in Wilmington, Del., which will feature a first-of-its-kind facility that converts two sources of biogas into power and heat for the city&amp;#39;s wastewater treatment plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project is part of a citywide initiative to decrease energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, a program that has also included Honeywell-led solar installations and energy-efficient building improvements. Combined, the upgrades will help the city trim its carbon footprint by approximately 35 percent and meet nearly 50 percent of its electricity needs with renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The centerpiece of the new project is the construction of a renewable energy bio-solids facility to harvest and harness naturally occurring biogas, supplying a renewable resource to not only generate electricity for the Hay Road Wastewater Treatment Plant but also provide thermal drying to reduce the volume of sewage sludge the city pays to remove. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bio-solids facility will capture methane produced by anaerobic digesters at the Hay Road plant, a potential energy source that is currently flared off. The gas will mix with additional methane from the nearby Cherry Island Landfill, which is operated by the Delaware Solid Waste Authority. The blend will be purified at the facility and used to power reciprocating engines that can generate up to 4 megawatts of electricity, which is enough energy to provide up to 90 percent of the treatment plant&amp;#39;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bio-solids that come out of the digesters will also be dehydrated by heat recovered from the engines. This thermal-drying process is expected to reduce the amount of sludge the city needs to truck away by approximately 75 percent, greatly reducing material-handling costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bio-solids facility is also projected to trim greenhouse gas emissions by 15,700 metric tons annually. According to figures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the decrease is equivalent to removing more than 3,000 cars from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Municipalities face the unique challenge of managing utility costs and emissions while simultaneously keeping taxpayer obligations in check,&amp;quot; said Paul Orzeske, president of Honeywell Building Solutions. &amp;quot;Through Honeywell&amp;#39;s expertise and the security of a performance contract, Wilmington can make necessary investments to further its environmental stewardship without adversely impacting its bottom line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Construction of the renewable energy bio-solids facility is expected to begin in the spring of 2013, with the building scheduled to be commissioned in the summer of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the second phase of the city&amp;#39;s sustainable energy initiative, building on previous work performed by Honeywell that includes the installation of photovoltaic solar arrays at the Wilmington water-filtration plant and municipal complex, conversion of all traffic lights to high-efficiency light-emitting diodes, and the installation of ultra-efficient lighting, heating and air-conditioning equipment in city-owned properties. To date, the project has generated more than $1 million in energy cost savings, and $590,000 in rebates and renewable energy credit revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nissan Plant Achieves Energy Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan&amp;rsquo;s vehicle assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., recently became the first passenger-vehicle manufacturing facility to attain ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance (SEP) certifications. Accredited under the American National Standards Institute and National Accreditation Board, these certifications recognize the Smyrna facility as a leader in energy management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of a pilot program established by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Nissan partnered with Georgia Tech Research Corp. and seven other companies to establish measurable standards of energy management. Employees at Smyrna&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing plant underwent a three-step process of conceiving an approach to reducing energy, adopting conservation tactics and sustaining efficient practices in the plant. Within three years of establishing a baseline, the Smyrna manufacturing facility improved energy performance by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Nissan is proud to have certified our Smyrna plant to the new international standard for energy management and to superior energy performance,&amp;rdquo; said Bill Krueger, vice chairman at Nissan Americas. &amp;ldquo;We are committed to increase energy efficiency as we reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing the highest quality vehicles sold in North America. These efforts align with our global strategies of zero-emission leadership and corporate social responsibility to employees, stakeholders and customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the new ISO 50001 and SEP certifications, the Smyrna manufacturing facility has been an Energy Star-certified efficient plant since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>8 Toyota Facilities Recognized by EPA</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized eight Toyota manufacturing sites in North America for achieving a 10-percent reduction in energy intensity through its Energy Star Challenge for Industry program. Collectively, the eight sites have reduced energy intensity by nearly 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Star Challenge for Industry program is awarded to individual industrial sites. To gain recognition, the site&amp;rsquo;s company must be an Energy Star partner. Energy intensity is measured relative to efficiency improvements in process and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America Inc. (TEMA) received its eighth consecutive Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award for protecting the environment through energy efficiency and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Thanks to the efforts of our team members, Toyota has reduced our total energy use per vehicle over the last five years as we achieved greater energy efficiency across North America,&amp;rdquo; said TEMA executive vice president Steve St. Angelo. &amp;ldquo;This demonstrates that when good ideas are shared, great things can happen as we continuously identify new opportunities to reduce energy consumption while improving our processes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The eight Toyota facilities recognized by the EPA include: Bodine Aluminum in Jackson, Tenn., and St. Louis, Mo.; Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Alabama; Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge and Woodstock, Ontario; Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Indiana; Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Texas; and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2006, Toyota&amp;rsquo;s U.S. manufacturing operations have received 18 Energy Star Plant Awards from the EPA, recognizing each plant&amp;rsquo;s energy performance over the past year and scoring in the top 25 percent of its industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Monmouth Upgrades New Jersey Plant with Green Manufacturing Practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Monmouth Rubber and Plastics recently completed a major expansion and upgrade at its Long Branch, N.J., plant with energy-saving measures to improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maker of neoprene sponge and foam as well as other closed-cell rubber and plastic materials expects the efficiency improvements to benefit its customers through increased product quality and lower production costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion includes a new equipment line, consisting of state-of-the-art mixers and presses, along with data monitoring of all processes. New electrical lighting throughout the facility should lower the company&amp;rsquo;s electric bills while improving visibility throughout the plant, which the company anticipates will increase worker morale and, subsequently, efficiency and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Monmouth is going state-of-the-art with efficiency on a global scale,&amp;rdquo; said company founder and general manager John M. Bonforte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company undertook the project with assistance from the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, which offers financial incentives for commercial, industrial and government customers to integrate energy efficient and renewable technologies into new construction and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The neoprene foam manufacturer also enrolled in an emergency demand response program, in which Monmouth Rubber and Plastics agreed to reduce its electric power consumption on demand during critical periods to help avoid local and regional power outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our participation in this program contributes to the overall protection of the power grid and helps avoid additional utility costs and lost revenues for all consumers and businesses in our community,&amp;rdquo; Bonforte said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Toyota is very honored by this recognition,&amp;rdquo; said Toshiya Yamagishi, president of TIEM. &amp;ldquo;As a company, we are committed to enhancing our associates&amp;rsquo; quality of life and contributing to the overall success of our community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, the chamber bestows a number of awards of distinction in order to foster a culture of excellence. These awards recognize extraordinary contributions from the business community that reflect positively on the quality and expertise of the Columbus, Ind., community. TIEM was selected as the &amp;ldquo;Company of the Year&amp;rdquo; because of distinctive accomplishments that impacted associates, the community and the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chamber recognized TIEM&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The establishment of a recovery plan soon after Japan&amp;rsquo;s 2011 earthquake and tsunami that adjusted work schedules and allowed associates to continue 40-hour work weeks.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Solar Power Plant to be built on Arizona State Campus</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Salt River Project (SRP), Arizona State University (ASU) and SunPower Corporation have announced an agreement to build a 1-megawatt solar photovoltaic power plant at ASU&amp;#39;s Polytechnic campus in Mesa, Ariz. The 1-megawatt facility will be the first commercial deployment of SunPower C7 Tracker technology, a solar photovoltaic tracking system that concentrates the sun&amp;#39;s power and is designed to achieve the lowest levelized cost of electricity for solar power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SunPower will engineer and construct the plant on the southeast corner of the ASU Polytechnic campus and will operate and maintain it. Under a purchase-power agreement, SRP will buy the entire output of the solar plant from SunPower, while ASU will purchase all of the energy attributable to the plant for use at its Polytechnic campus. The plant is expected to produce energy equal to that needed to serve about 225 SRP customers&amp;#39; homes. It will require minimal water use and will support ASU&amp;#39;s renewable energy goals. Construction of the plant is contingent on a number of factors, including receipt of all applicable permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The installation of SunPower&amp;#39;s ground-breaking technology helps move ASU closer to our 2014 20-megawatt solar-energy-generating goal,&amp;quot; said David Brixen, ASU&amp;#39;s associate vice president of facilities development and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As we continue to add resources to our sustainable portfolio, SRP is very interested in finding new low-cost and efficient renewable-energy technologies that can help keep our customers&amp;#39; prices low,&amp;quot; said John Sullivan, SRP&amp;#39;s chief resource executive. &amp;quot;SunPower&amp;#39;s C7 Tracker System is the type of promising technology that can provide both benefits.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The C7 Tracker combines single-axis tracking technology with rows of parabolic mirrors reflecting light onto efficient large-area solar cells. Using mirrors to reduce the number of solar cells required to generate electricity can lower the levelized cost of electricity by up to 20 percent compared to competing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The SunPower C7 Tracker leverages SunPower&amp;#39;s depth of experience developing reliable tracking systems and delivers bankable technology with guaranteed performance,&amp;quot; said Howard Wenger, SunPower president. &amp;quot;We applaud our partners on this project in selecting this advanced technology platform that will deliver cost-effective renewable energy for the long-term.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ASU solar plant will be the third commercial-scale solar facility in the Valley of the Sun to provide energy for SRP. Recently, SRP reached an agreement to purchase the output of a 19-megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in Queen Creek. Copper Crossing, a 20-megawatt facility located in Pinal County and designed and built by SunPower, began providing energy for SRP&amp;#39;s Community Solar program last year. More than 100 schools in 11 Valley school districts are tapping into the power of the sun from that plant to offset a portion of their electric needs through the program. Community Solar is also open to residential customers, allowing customers to invest in solar energy without the upfront costs or maintenance of a rooftop system.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Patti Engineering Completes Automation Project at Inman Mills Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/30/986cef41-59de-46df-8490-f9354b0b7b7f_inman3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 249px; height: 126px; float: left;" /&gt;Patti Engineering Inc. has announced the successful completion of an automation project at the Inman Mills plant in Inman, S.C., which manufactures a wide variety of yarns and fabrics. This is the sixth textile manufacturing facility Patti Engineering has modernized with custom-designed automation technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inman Mills purchased a pre-owned Autoflow system (conveyors, motors and control panels), including an obsolete electrical-control system. Inman hired Patti Engineering to design and install a state-of-the-art electrical-control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The latest PC hardware, Phoenix Contact&amp;rsquo;s Steeplechase Visual Logic Controller (VLC) and Iconics Graphical User Interface (GUI) software were used to build a fully integrated electrical-control system. In addition to the design and installation, Patti Engineering provided training to Inman&amp;rsquo;s maintenance personnel, operators and management team for optimal utilization of the new system to maximize production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Implementing cost-effective electrical-control system solutions in textile manufacturing facilities has been a growing niche for Patti Engineering, fueled by word-of-mouth referrals,&amp;rdquo; explained Sam Hoff, president of Patti Engineering. &amp;ldquo;It was a pleasure to work with Inman Mills. We were impressed with their commitment to implementation of the best automation technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Patti Engineering has worked with other textile manufacturers to retrofit their existing equipment with new and more advanced electrical-control systems. Retrofits cost just pennies on the dollar compared to replacing inefficient equipment, allowing manufacturers to double the life of the system, adding&amp;nbsp;an additional 15 to 20 years of run time with high reliability and a significant boost to productivity and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Patti Engineering&amp;rsquo;s solutions include additional features not available with the original machine control. New software programs are written for better support and debug. Configurations and logging databases are incorporated to provide a better history of events to improve debug. Enhanced functionality and management capabilities are also added to run the systems more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Lubricant Market Expands to Wind Turbines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Global lubricant demand is forecast to reach 40.5 million metric tons in 2012. According to a recent study, the market is estimated at $48.8 billion. Companies in this booming market are expanding their lubricant lines to include those for more industries such as wind. Wind equipment requires specialized lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, they may require certain blends of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings in wind-power stations. One trend has been toward reducing maintenance costs and simplifying lubrication routines in the nacelle. Also, as wind turbines are built higher and in more extreme conditions, the trends is toward using low-viscosity lubricants to address cold weather effects, produce more power, and decrease micropitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, engineers are using specialty synthetics instead of mineral oils, along with particle counters to control contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reduce maintenance costs and simplify lubrication in the nacelle, operators are using one lubricant for all bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Repairs on wind turbines can be costly, difficult, and dangerous,&amp;rdquo; says Jesse Dilk, wind industry manager at Kl&amp;uuml;ber. &amp;ldquo;Therefore, it is vital to use high-quality components at every opportunity. Bearings, seals, and lubricants are essential design elements when analyzing mechanical systems. Optimizing these elements leads to a more efficient, reliable machine design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Kl&amp;uuml;ber&amp;rsquo;s high-performance grease has a blend of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings. Another adhesive grease lubricates gears in pitch and yaw drives, while reducing the risk of migration inside the nacelle and onto the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, the industry has moved toward using synthetics instead of mineral oils to minimize maintenance. &amp;ldquo;The lubricants tend to be well balanced, and have been widely tested in laboratory rigs and in the field,&amp;rdquo; Dilk says. &amp;ldquo;The preference for synthetics include high wear protection, higher efficiency from lower friction, and a wide operating temperature range. Specialty synthetic lubricants typically outperform mineral-based versions under the same conditions. Synthetics are further driven by a requirement for extended lubrication intervals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Exxon Mobil Corp. engineers also say synthetic gear oil protects against micropitting, scuffing wear, and corrosion. Synthetic oils function over a wide temperature range and resist deposit formation. Furthermore, many new lubricants and greases extend oil change intervals from a matter of months to years, which significantly reduces time and cost of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shell Lubricants also says it recognizes the significance of reduced reliability and demands of operating wind farms in remote locations (on and offshore) and in harsh climates. Their engineers have developed a variety of lubricants to withstand extremely low temperatures and protect against micropitting and bearing wear. Another trend is to monitor the oil conditions, especially in gearboxes. Shell, for example, offers an oil-analysis program that can help operators monitor the condition of their lubricant along with equipment that helps avoid unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, particle counters, such as those from Parker Hannifin Corp., provide contamination control for lubricants. Such units independently monitor system contamination trends, and give early warnings. LEDs or digital displays indicate low, medium, and high contamination levels. Such advancements, keep oil clean and increase its lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/7HwL8cGG9wM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>First Oil Reprocessing Plant in New England Almost Complete</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ROLLINSFORD, N.H. &amp;mdash; Construction at Green View Technologies is about 80 percent complete and owners are excited their dream of creating New England&amp;#39;s first oil reprocessing facility has almost come to fruition.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View President Mark Wentworth, whose family owns Wentworth Greenhouses, said the state-of-the-art plant on Green View Drive will likely be completed in mid-to-late summer, something he and others involved in the project are eagerly awaiting.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;We think it&amp;#39;s going be good for the environment and reduce the amount of used motor oil put back into it by reblending it back into new oil,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;It should be a big benefit for the area. There are no other facilities like it. The technology&amp;#39;s fairly new, and it should become very popular as environmental concerns become greater over new oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The facility received local and state approval late last year. It is designed to clean used oil to be reused in commercial lubrication purposes, and Wentworth said his company plans to sell the cleaned oil to other companies to reblend it for a variety of retail purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said the facility adds 28 new jobs to the town and has the capacity to produce several million gallons of product a year. That total includes the byproducts of the process: distillate fuel, which is heavy-metal free and will be used to run the plant as well as sold to other businesses, such as Wentworth Greenhouses; and an asphalt product that can be used for roads and roof materials.&lt;br /&gt;
	Wentworth said only about 2 percent of the product volume is unusable, as wastewater is generated by the process, while roughly 75 percent of the total product volume will be reprocessed oil, about 15 percent is fuel and the remainder is asphalt.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said this efficiency, as well as the cleaner oils, will help reduce emissions because Green View isn&amp;#39;t disposing of used oil or waste in an incinerator, as well as the fact the fuel generated by the process is cleaner and will help companies using it reduce their emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once oil is burned, the resource is gone forever,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;Our process recovers that resource and we&amp;#39;re able to use it over and over again, basically forever, so it&amp;#39;s a good thing for the environment and energy conservation because it takes less energy to reprocess old oil than to refine new crude oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	Aside from concerns about odors from the plant, which Wentworth has said they have mitigated through the design process, town officials have also expressed satisfaction about bringing the facility to Rollinsford because it will help boost the tax base and bolster the local economy.&lt;br /&gt;
	Warren Daniel, the regional manager of the state&amp;#39;s Small Business Development Center, also said he thinks the plant will be a notable addition to the area.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;I think that the plant is going to be a tremendous job creator,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the kind of company we need in New Hampshire regarding sustainability and regarding bringing energy production to this country.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Small Business Development Center as well as the Southeast Economic Development Corporation assisted Green View in developing a business plan and secure financing for the project, the cost of which Wentworth declined to disclose.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View financed part of the project through two different loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration, as well as through a $480,000 loan through the community development block grant program.&lt;br /&gt;
	The block grant, loaned to Green View through the SEDC after the state and town approved the use of the grant, is the first-ever for Rollinsford, according to SEDC Executive Director Dennis McCann.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said that milestone is important because he said the facility could not have been built without the block grant, which is a federal program that funds projects that, among other things, benefit low-income circumstances and/or work toward the betterment of the community.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said he was grateful to have been a part of the process, and said he is looking forward to &amp;quot;celebrating&amp;quot; the end of the construction with Wentworth because Green View has been in the works for about 2 1/2 years.&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a while,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re pretty excited to participate in New England&amp;#39;s first recycling plant for lubricating oil, especially when other areas of the country (and world) have these facilities and we don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/GTSL0cJGWfg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Expanded Lubrication Oil Monitoring for Gas Compressors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Boston, MA &amp;ndash; Protecting their large hydrogen screw compressors while assuring refinery uptime, the largest US Gulf Coast refiner is adding in-line lube &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" size="3"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" size="3"&gt;oil viscometers &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;to all their new and existing units. The sensors will be used to provide real-time continuous monitoring of the compressor bearing lubrication fluid throughout equipment operations. A lead engineer at this facility says, &amp;quot;Despite using separators, the lubricant can become diluted by gas carry-over or contamination. If left unchecked, this can cause problems, especially during subsequent start-ups.&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity President Robert Kasameyer says that &amp;quot;when the compressor is running, the lubrication oil is hot and the entrained gas remains in gaseous phase. When the compressor is down, the lubrication oil cools and some of this gas can become liquid, which causes the lube oil viscosity to drop. Then, when the equipment is re-started but before it heats up, the equipment is operating with inadequate lubrication, which can be a disaster! If it makes it through this stage, the light hydrocarbons will again become gaseous, separating out of the lube oil, and the lube oil will regain its proper viscosity. But the damage will already be done.&amp;quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;The refinery is centralizing the viscosity sensor outputs with easy-to-access and use displays tied to the overall plant information system. The refinery uses centralized monitoring stations, each of which receives instantaneous information. One is currently tracking four viscometers while another connects with ten individual sensors on different gas compressors. This saves lab and technician time, as well as potential damage to the equipment itself. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: times new roman, times, serif"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;About Cambridge Viscosity&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity, the leader in small sample viscometry, provides automated viscometers for advanced laboratory and production viscometer systems worldwide. Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s global reach is important for providing application engineering support and service wherever and whenever needed &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="3"&gt;Cambridge Viscosity sets the standard for precise, reliable and low maintenance viscosity measurement and control systems. Patented oscillating piston technology ensures accurate, true results across a broad range of lab and in-line applications, including refining and petrochemicals, oil and gas, coatings, paints and inks, pharmaceuticals and other substances.

            <title>Universal Lubricants set to recycle used oil for Colorado company</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;WICHITA, Kan.&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;April 6, 2011&lt;/span&gt; /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Lubricants, America&amp;#39;s only true closed loop oil recycling company, today announced that &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt; on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair company Equipment Savers has hired them to recycle tens of thousands of used oil filters and approximately 55,000 gallons of used oil each year. The recovered oil from the filters and the used oil will be re-refined at the company&amp;#39;s advanced refinery in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt; to make its American Petroleum Institute (API) certified green motor&amp;mdash;ECO ULTRA&amp;reg;. The scrap steel from the oil filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products ensuring that nothing ends up in a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; tightly controlled closed loop oil recycling process gives us the piece of mind and confidence that our used oil filters and oil will be properly recycled,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Tom Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;, Service Manager at Equipment Savers Fleet Services. &amp;quot;For over two decades, Equipment Savers has been providing safe and environmentally responsible on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair services in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Arizona&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Texas&lt;/span&gt; and our relationship with Universal Lubricants furthers that corporate commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. produces approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used oil each year, and only 10% of it is re-refined. &amp;nbsp;The rest of the used oil is either improperly disposed of (damaging the environment) or burned as an industrial fuel and is gone forever. Additionally, over 400 million oil filters are used in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt; every year, containing 22 million gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, many of those filters end up landfills and the oil that they contain contaminates the environment and is gone forever. Universal Lubricants is working to reverse these trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants is dedicated to protecting the environment and conserving our natural resources&amp;mdash;each week we collect and recycle 150,000 used oil filters reclaiming thousands of gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;That reclaimed oil as well as the used oil will collect from around the country is re-refined back to high quality base stock oil and then blended to make our high performance, green ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; motor oil,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/span&gt;, Chief Executive Officer of Universal Lubricants. &amp;quot;We appreciate Equipment Savers commitment to making a difference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants collects used oil filters and oil from the government and private businesses such as repair centers, auto parts stores, dealerships, service stations, and oil change centers across &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt;. The company then transports those oil filters to its oil recovery center in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;. The oil recovered is put into the company&amp;#39;s technologically advanced re-refinery where it undergoes a state-of-the-art hydro-treating process to remove all of the water, fuel and solvents as well as metals, asphalt flux and other heavy contaminants. The purified high quality Grade II base stock oil is then blended with a synthetic formula and additives to make API certified ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products. The scrap steel from the filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants operates 28 facilities in 14 states, including a branch in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Denver, Colorado&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;For more information about Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products and used oil and filter collection services, visit &lt;a href="http://www.universallubes.com" s_oid="http://www.universallubes.com/" s_oidt="0" target="_blank"&gt;www.universallubes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/ljAX_tXIEU8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston facility earns LEED certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston&amp;rsquo;s Delhi, La., processing facility received its official Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification on January 20, awarded by the U. S. Green Building Council (USGBC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Delhi facility is the first frozen food manufacturing plant worldwide to earn LEED Platinum certification, the highest distinction available to green buildings. The design, construction and operations at the Delhi processing facility were all developed with environmental impact and sustainability in mind. The plant primarily processes sweet potatoes from Louisiana and the surrounding states &amp;ndash; prime sweet potato-growing regions &amp;ndash; and was built from the ground up using the newest and best processing and packaging technologies. Operations began in September 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state-of-the art equipment featured in the plant was uniquely designed to process sweet potatoes in the most efficient and environmentally responsible way &amp;ndash; key for long-term, economic sustainability. The plant will eventually convert fresh sweet potatoes into many different consumer and restaurant products prepared from frozen. Efficient operations mean more efficient use of natural resources within the community, including energy and water. Employees also benefit from the green building design; it is climate-controlled throughout to enhance productivity, safety and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had an opportunity to build something from scratch and set out to build a great sustainable plant because it was right for the business and who we are as a company,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Martin, vice president for manufacturing at Lamb Weston. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been producing quality sweet potato products for the past 10 years, which allowed us to bring the best of what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned during this time to the design and construction of the Delhi plant.&amp;rdquo; To earn this distinction as the first LEED Platinum frozen food manufacturing plant in the world reflects the entire project team&amp;rsquo;s hard work and ConAgra Foods&amp;rsquo; investment in innovation and excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To earn LEED Platinum certification, a building is evaluated by the USGBC on a number of specific criteria: sustainable sites (protecting the environment), water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and the innovation and design process. Notable features of the Lamb Weston LEED Platinum plant include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The entire plant is climate controlled to increase worker productivity, safety and comfort. Climate control in such a hot, humid environment reduces condensation build up and water on the floors, reducing slip and fall and hazards. Materials, such as low VOC (volatile organic compounds) carpeting, cleaning products and paints, are used in the interior of the plant to reduce occupant exposure to airborne pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy-saving equipment is projected to save 40% of the annual energy consumed at a comparable plant. By identifying and recovering potential wasted energy within the building systems and processes, energy demand is greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Biogas, produced by treating process waste water, is piped back to the plant boilers to produce steam. This process is expected to offset approximately 20% of the annual natural gas demand of the plant, and prevents methane, a harmful greenhouse gas, from entering the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than 100 acres of the property will be maintained as open space, including protected wetland areas, ponds and restored native vegetation. Water is conserved outside the building by landscaping with native plant species that require no irrigation once established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Priority parking is given to low-emission, fuel efficient vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Project partners included Fisher &amp;amp; Sons Design/Build, a leading design and construction firm with expertise in the food industry based in Burlington, Wash., and Paladino and Company, a Seattle, Wash.-based sustainability and green building consulting firm at the forefront of the green building movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are proud to have worked alongside the team at ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston to bring this project from the drawing board to a reality,&amp;rdquo; said Jerome Fisher, CEO of Fisher Companies. &amp;ldquo;The Delhi plant was our first project incorporating LEED design and building strategies. We pride ourselves on excellence and look forward to applying the experience and knowledge gained on this project for future projects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This LEED Platinum rating is really the icing on the cake for a well-designed sustainable project,&amp;rdquo; said Patrick Leonard, green building consultant, LEED AP, Paladino and Company. &amp;ldquo;LEED was used as a back check to validate the sustainable strategies implemented during design and construction. The Platinum rating is the positive outcome of our team&amp;rsquo;s focus on balancing the project&amp;rsquo;s impacts to the planet, employees and the community, and Lamb Weston&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lamb Weston, a brand of ConAgra Foods, Inc., is North America&amp;#39;s premier supplier of frozen potato, sweet potato, appetizer and other vegetable products, serving both the foodservice and retail industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/2bAsimC_C8M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Study yields better turbine spacing for large wind farms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Large wind farms are being built around the world as a cleaner way to generate electricity, but operators are still searching for the most efficient way to arrange the massive turbines that turn moving air into power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help steer wind farm owners in the right direction, Charles Meneveau, a Johns Hopkins fluid mechanics and turbulence expert, working with a colleague in Belgium, has devised a new formula through which the optimal spacing for a large array of turbines can be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I believe our results are quite robust,&amp;rdquo; said Meneveau, who is the Louis Sardella Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the university&amp;rsquo;s Whiting School of Engineering. &amp;ldquo;They indicate that large wind farm operators are going to have to space their turbines farther apart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The newest wind farms, which can be located on land or offshore, typically use turbines with rotor diameters of about 300 feet. Currently, turbines on these large wind farms are spaced about seven rotor diameters apart. The new spacing model developed by Meneveau and Johan Meyers, an assistant professor at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, suggests that placing the wind turbines 15 rotor diameters apart -- more than twice as far apart as in the current layouts -- results in more cost-efficient power generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meneveau presented the study results recently at a meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics. Meyers, co-author of the study, was unable to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The research is important because large wind farms &amp;ndash; consisting of hundreds or even thousands of turbines &amp;ndash; are planned or already operating in the western United States, Europe and China. &amp;ldquo;The early experience is that they are producing less power than expected,&amp;rdquo; Meneveau said. &amp;ldquo;Some of these projects are underperforming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier computational models for large wind farm layouts were based on simply adding up what happens in the wakes of single wind turbines, Meneveau said. The new spacing model, he said, takes into account interaction of arrays of turbines with the entire atmospheric wind flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meneveau and Meyers argue that the energy generated in a large wind farm has less to do with horizontal winds and is more dependent on the strong winds that the turbulence created by the tall turbines pulls down from higher up in the atmosphere. Using insights gleaned from high-performance computer simulations as well as from wind tunnel experiments, they determined that in the correct spacing, the turbines alter the landscape in a way that creates turbulence, which stirs the air and helps draw more powerful kinetic energy from higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The experiments were conducted in the Johns Hopkins wind tunnel, which uses a large fan to generate a stream of air. Before it enters the testing area, the air passes through an &amp;ldquo;active grid,&amp;rdquo; a curtain of perforated plates that rotate randomly and create turbulence so that the air moving through the tunnel more closely resembles real-life wind conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Air currents in the tunnel pass through a series of small three-bladed model wind turbines mounted atop posts, mimicking an array of full-size wind turbines. Data concerning the interaction of the air currents and the model turbines is collected by using a measurement procedure called stereo particle-image-velocimetry, which requires a pair of high-resolution digital cameras, smoke and laser pulses.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Further research is needed, Meneveau said, to learn how varying temperatures can affect the generation of power on large wind farms. The Johns Hopkins professor has applied for continued funding to conduct such studies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nissan obtains integrated ISO14001 certification for all main facilities in Japan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company Ltd. on January 20 announced that it had received integrated ISO14001 certification, an international standard for environmental management systems, for the company&amp;#39;s global headquarters and all of its main facilities in Japan covering the areas of research and development, production, distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December 2006, Nissan set objectives to bolster its environmental management through Nissan Green Program 2010, the company&amp;#39;s mid-term environmental action plan. Having already previously obtained the certification for its five production plants, Nissan Zama Operation Center, Nissan Technical Center (NTC), Nissan Advanced Technology Center (NATC), Nissan Research Center and its product/development processes, the company has now achieved a consistent environmental management, as additional certification was obtained at its new global headquarters, Honmoku Wharf, Customer Service Centers, Global Information System Center, Sagamihara Parts Center, Nissan Education Center and Hokkaido Rikubetsu Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This integrated environmental management has also been applied to Nissan Forklift Corporation and Automotive Energy Supply Corporation, which are affiliates or partner companies of Nissan. As a result, a combined workforce of more than 30,000 people is working on environmental activities with a higher consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In particular, the global headquarters (opened in August 2009), has already obtained the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE)&amp;#39;s highest ranking (Class S) in October 2009, in addition to proactively promoting the efficient utilization of natural energy. Today&amp;#39;s announcement proves that the Global Headquarters achieved the establishment of environmental management in all domains-buildings, working processes and business activities in roughly just one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan will continue activities to strengthen its environmental management, as well as providing models to the market with high environmental performance, &amp;quot;Zero Emission&amp;quot; with its focus on 100 percent electric vehicles and &amp;quot;PURE DRIVE&amp;quot; that are designed to achieve class-leading fuel economy with next-generation eco-technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/CyABAsspQK0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Energy projects transform trash to green power</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized six landfill methane capture projects and partners for their innovation in generating renewable energy and protecting the climate and people&amp;rsquo;s health by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. EPA has assisted with more than 490 landfill gas energy projects over the past 16 years, transforming waste into a green community asset. Landfill gas electricity generation projects have a capacity of 1,680 megawatts (MW) and provide the energy equivalent of powering more than 994,000 homes annually as a clean energy source. The United States currently has approximately 540 operational landfill gas energy projects.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The six winners, announced at the 14th annual Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) conference in Baltimore, include a project that powers manufacturing at a green business park in Indiana and a 10 megawatt combined cycle power plant in Ohio. These projects will contribute to job creation and provide energy savings and green power generation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Methane, a primary component of landfill gas, is a GHG with more than 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Using landfill gas has several benefits: it provides a significant energy resource, prevents GHG emissions, and reduces odors and other hazards associated with emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s winning projects will avoid the emissions of 165,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This reduction is equivalent to the annual GHG emissions from more than 31,600 passenger vehicles or the carbon dioxide emissions from 385,200 barrels of oil consumed. The direct-use projects will use 830 standard cubic feet per minute and the electricity-generating projects total 13.3 megawatts of generation capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Awardees are Montgomery Regional Solid Waste Authority Small Engine Project, Christiansburg, Va.; Frederick County Electricity Project, Winchester, Va.; Crow Wing County Small On-site LFG Boiler Project, Brainerd, Minn.; Hoffman Road LFG and Bay View WWTP Digester Gas 10-MW Project, Toledo, Ohio; and Newton County Renewable Energy Park LFG Direct-Use Project, Brook, Ind. The community partner of the year is Escambia County, Pensacola, Fla.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA&amp;rsquo;s LMOP is a voluntary assistance and partnership program that reduces GHG emissions by supporting landfill gas energy project development. The program also assists countries throughout the world in developing landfill methane reduction projects through the international Global Methane Initiative.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>GE ships 1,000th aeroderivative gas turbine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE on January 14 announced the shipment of its 1,000th LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbine to Black Hills Corporation as part of its Pueblo Airport Generation Station being constructed in Pueblo, Colo. GE&amp;rsquo;s 1,000 LM6000 gas turbines produced to date have accumulated 21.8 million operating hours for 260 customers in 43 countries on six different continents, including in 37 of the 50 United States.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GE&amp;rsquo;s innovative LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbines will allow us to provide the best service possible to our customers,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Lux, vice president and general manager, Power Delivery, Black Hills Corporation. &amp;ldquo;We have a long history with GE and are excited to help them mark this important milestone and celebrate their history of providing solutions that help increase productivity and efficiency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Of the 1,000 LM6000 gas turbines produced by GE, 748 have single annular combustors and 252 have dry low emissions combustors. The customer with the largest fleet is Petrobras with 42 units, and GDF Suez Group has the largest DLE fleet installed with 28 units.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From the time the first unit began commercial operation in 1992 at the Ottawa Health Services facility to the shipment of the 1,000th unit, our LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbine has become the only gas turbine in the world with simple-cycle efficiency greater than 40 percent and dry low emissions combustion technology that guarantees less than 15ppm NOx,,&amp;rdquo; said Darryl Wilson, vice president of aeroderivative gas turbines for GE Power &amp;amp; Water. &amp;ldquo;This latest milestone exemplifies GE&amp;rsquo;s commitment to providing innovative technology that aims to meet environmental challenges throughout the world and helps our customers be successful and productive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Other facts about the LM6000 that make this milestone significant include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		High time unit has more than 114,000 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Units have been installed as far north as Statoil&amp;rsquo;s Snohvit LNG plant (north of the Arctic Circle) and units closest to the Equator are in Guayquil, Ecuador.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In addition to today&amp;rsquo;s announcement near the Pueblo, Colo. airport, LM6000 gas turbines have been installed at other major airports such as Toronto, New York&amp;rsquo;s JFK and Paris Charles de Gaulle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		GE&amp;rsquo;s LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbines back up wind farms in Texas and Kansas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The LM6000 supports the grids in or near major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Moscow, Mexico City and Tokyo.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Of the 1,000 units installed worldwide, 13 have been installed offshore.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The LM6000 has been installed in many various industries including: more than 20 in mining operations for gold, nickel, iron and coal; in the food processing industry as sugar, chocolates and orange juice; and in industrial applications such as automobile, tires, cement plants, aluminum smelters, refineries, chemicals and paper mills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Black Hills Corporation is scheduled to set its four LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbines from GE on their foundation in February 2011. The generation facility is expected to be in service by January 1, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Pueblo Airport Generation Station will consist of four units: two Black Hills Energy &amp;ndash; Colorado Electric utility-owned, natural gas-fired GE LMS100 units and two Black Hills Colorado IPP-owned, high-efficiency, combined-cycle units. Each of the combined-cycle units will consist of two 40-megawatt natural gas-fired GE LM6000 turbines and one 20-MW steam turbine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The January 14 milestone announcement builds on GE&amp;rsquo;s announcement on October 7, 2010, that the LM6000-PG and LM6000-PH, the latest enhancements of the proven LM6000 aeroderivative gas turbine product line, had both hit critical validation testing milestones. The LM6000-PG completed more than 160 hours of validation testing and exceeded performance expectations. The LM6000-PH, which is the dry low emissions equivalent of the PG, began first engine to test qualifications in late 2010. The new LM6000-PH engine package includes the latest advancements in dry low emissions (DLE 2.0) technology. In addition, the next-generation LM6000-PG with single annular combustor began package testing at GE&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing facility in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/BGNOGe-kBwQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>13 Japanese companies eye smooth domestic launch of FCVs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Nissan Motor Company, Honda Motor Company, JX Nippon Oil &amp;amp; Energy Corporation, Idemitsu Kosan Company, Iwatani Corporation, Osaka Gas Company, Cosmo Oil Company, Saibu Gas Company, Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, Tokyo Gas Company and Toho Gas Company jointly announced the following details regarding the launch of mass-produced fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) &amp;mdash; one of a number of potential next-generation vehicles &amp;mdash; in the Japanese market in 2015 and the development of the hydrogen supply infrastructure necessary for the successful adoption of the vehicles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="20"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;As development of fuel-cell systems progresses, Japanese automakers are continuing to drastically reduce the cost of manufacturing such systems and are aiming to launch FCVs in the Japanese market &amp;mdash; mainly in the country&amp;#39;s four major metropolitan areas&amp;mdash;in 2015. &amp;nbsp;The automobile industry hopes to popularize the use of FCVs after their initial introduction as a way of tackling energy and environmental issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Hydrogen fuel suppliers are aiming to construct approximately 100 hydrogen fueling stations by 2015, based on the number of FCVs expected to initially enter the market, to ensure a smooth launch and to create initial market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;With an aim to significantly reduce the amount of CO&lt;span class="small"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emitted by the transportation sector, automakers and hydrogen fuel suppliers will work together to expand the introduction of FCVs and develop the hydrogen supply network throughout Japan. The two groups are looking to the government to join them in forming various strategies* to support their joint efforts and to gain greater consumer acceptance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="small"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;As a specific initiative in the immediate future, the companies plan to approach local governments and other concerned parties to discuss strategies for creating initial consumer demand for FCVs and for the optimal placement of hydrogen fueling stations, targeting Japan&amp;#39;s four major metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/N7nPGz5538o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE buys in to one of largest U.S. wind energy projects starting operations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE Energy Financial Services, a unit of GE, and Bankers Commercial Corporation, a unit of UnionBanCal Corporation, announced January 10 that they have purchased the first wind farm to start operations in one of the largest wind energy projects in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Energy Financial Services and Bankers Commercial Corporation acquired the 150-megawatt Alta Wind I wind farm in Tehachapi, in Kern County, California, and are leasing it back to its developer, operator and manager, Terra-Gen Power LLC. The wind farm, using 100 GE 1.5-megawatt SLE turbines, was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. GE Energy Financial Services &amp;ndash; a major global investor in multiple energy generation and distribution projects and companies &amp;ndash; and Bankers Commercial Corporation each own 50 percent of the wind farm. Funds from the sale will be used to pay off construction loans Terra-Gen entered into for the project last March. Financial details were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Alta Wind I farm is the first phase of the Alta Wind Energy Center, a planned 3,000-megawatt project. The first 1,550 megawatts of the center, including this phase, is contracted to Southern California Edison. When complete, the center will be able to provide electricity for 1.3 million California homes. Terra-Gen estimates the center will create more than 3,000 domestic manufacturing, construction, operations and maintenance jobs, and will contribute more than $1.2 billion to Kern County&amp;rsquo;s economy. According to Terra-Gen, the center is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 52 million metric tons over the next decade, equivalent to taking 890,000 cars off the road. The wind farms will help California meet its goal of ensuring that by 2020, 33 percent of the power it consumes comes from renewable sources. Alta Wind I is the first project to connect with Southern California Edison&amp;rsquo;s Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project, the first major transmission project in California to be constructed specifically for accessing a renewable-rich resource area. When completed, the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project will consist of more than 250 miles of new and upgraded high-voltage transmission infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This transaction, our first using a lease for a wind farm, demonstrates our ability to tailor structures to meet our customers&amp;rsquo; needs, in this case enabling Terra-Gen to free up cash while enabling it to continue to operate and manage the project,&amp;rdquo; said Kevin Walsh, a managing director and leader of power and renewable energy at GE Energy Financial Services. &amp;ldquo;In addition, it builds on our recently achieved target of accumulating $6 billion in renewable energy investments by the end of last year, and it reinforces our commitment to ecomagination, GE&amp;rsquo;s program to help its customers meet their environmental challenges while expanding its own portfolio of cleaner energy products.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lance Markowitz, president of Bankers Commercial Corporation, said: &amp;ldquo;We look forward to the long-term success of Alta Wind 1, one of the premier wind projects in the United States. The quality of Alta 1 and the expertise required to develop the greater Alta Wind Center are a credit to the Terra-Gen team. This investment demonstrates how we apply our structuring expertise and industry knowledge to attractive financing solutions for the renewable energy market. We now have committed investments in projects aggregating more than 2,000 megawatts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	John O&amp;#39;Connor, chief financial officer of Terra-Gen, said: &amp;ldquo;The 150-megawatt Alta Wind I project represents the important first phase of the Alta Wind Energy Center, which when complete is expected to comprise approximately 3,000 megawatts. This transaction will allow Terra-Gen to free up capital and maintain operating control of Alta I.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project is eligible for a US Treasury grant created under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It allows renewable energy project owners to access a cash grant in lieu of tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/cBacqsMpvZo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IBM study: Electric cars stir interest but face obstacles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many automobile industry executives believe that sales of traditional vehicles will peak before 2020 and are looking to electric-only vehicles (EVs) as one of the next hot products, but they will first have to address stringent consumer requirements about EV performance, recharging, and convenience, according to a new IBM survey of consumer attitudes and a recent study of auto industry executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taken together, the two studies uncover significant differences between the automobile industry executives IBM spoke to and consumers on the factors motivating consumers to purchase electric vehicles, with auto execs placing greater emphasis than consumers on government incentives and oil prices. The executives were also skeptical of consumers&amp;#39; willingness to pay a premium for green vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The insights, from IBM&amp;#39;s Institute for Business Value (IBV), are derived from a new survey of 1,716 U.S. drivers(i) and interviews with 123 auto industry executives.(ii) The study indicates that, even in these early days, there is a potentially large market for EVs. Nineteen percent of drivers surveyed said that they were either &amp;quot;very likely&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; to consider purchasing an electric-only vehicle when shopping for a new car. This is notable, given that 42 percent of drivers know only &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot; about EVs or have &amp;quot;only heard of them,&amp;quot; suggesting that automakers could increase the pool of potential buyers with sustained educational campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thirty percent of drivers surveyed said that they would consider switching to an EV that got 100 miles or less per charge. Current EVs get about 50 to 100 miles per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And 40 percent of drivers said they would pay up to 20 percent more for an electric-only vehicle compared with a similarly-featured gas-, diesel or hybrid-powered vehicle, with 27 percent saying they would pay 10 percent more and 13 percent saying they would pay 20 percent more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To drive the price of electric vehicles into this more affordable zone, the IBV research indicates that automakers should initially focus on sales to both consumers and commercial fleets, building scale and creating economic efficiencies in production. Automakers may also need to develop new business models for electric vehicles to overcome the higher initial price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home charging: a sticking point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nevertheless, price of the home charging installation often required to support an EV could pose an obstacle to EV adoption. Only 13 percent of drivers said they would consider spending more than &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$1,000&lt;/span&gt; to retrofit their residence to support recharging of an electric vehicle. According to industry estimates, retrofitting to a 240 volt outlet accessible to vehicles averages between &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$1,000 and $2,000&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, two-thirds of consumers expect a price discount on their electricity for charging at home overnight. &amp;nbsp;This expectation could place increasing focus on utilities for time-based pricing to encourage home charging, or more public charging will be required if an electricity discount is not available. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Home charging is considered important to the success of EVs. Of the drivers surveyed, 83 percent said they park their primary vehicle in the driveway or garage of their private residence, as opposed to in a parking lot, on the street, in a shared garage or some other location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Even under optimal circumstances, fully recharging an electric-only vehicle takes hours,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Kal Gyimesi&lt;/span&gt;, IBV automotive lead and co-author of the IBV study. &amp;quot;So, it is crucially important that we build an infrastructure that can charge vehicles where their owners park them for extended periods of time &amp;ndash; whether that is at home or at work, school, or the store.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to put those charging stations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Perhaps a reflection of America&amp;#39;s consumer culture, 62 percent of drivers surveyed said they most often parked in a mall or store parking lot when not at home or work. That&amp;#39;s substantially higher than any other location &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;on the street&amp;quot; was number two at 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When deciding where to put charging stations, retail hubs like malls and shopping centers are good locations,&amp;quot; Gyimesi said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy to envision charging stations in these commercial locations coupled with an advertising and promotion-based business model for local stores &amp;ndash; which will help make the economics more feasible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partnering with large employers in target regions to create charging infrastructure in the workplace also makes sense, Gyimesi added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consumers were asked what would motivate them to switch from using a vehicle that currently runs on gasoline, diesel or hybrid to an electric-only vehicle. The same question was posed to automobile industry executives, who were asked to rate the importance consumers place on each choice. A chart summarizing responses follows:&lt;/p&gt;

	The answers illustrate that the automobile industry executives IBM interviewed for this study place far greater weight than consumers on government incentives/regulations (73 percent to 41 percent) and significantly higher oil prices (76 percent to 51 percent). The executives also place less emphasis than consumers on green image/sustainability concerns (33 percent to 48 percent).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the IBV study, when asked executives how automakers could develop mobility solutions, 83 percent said that the best direction would be to shift their product portfolio from conventional vehicles to electrified vehicles (EVs). About half said they expect the annual sales of conventional vehicles to have begun to decline by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urban/Suburban/Rural Divide?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Responses for the driver survey were similar across urban, suburban and rural areas&amp;nbsp;-- with some notable exceptions. For example, rural respondents were the most likely (59 percent) to say they would pay nothing more for an electric-only vehicle compared with a similarly-featured gas-, diesel or hybrid-powered vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(i) &amp;nbsp;To better understand consumer perceptions of electric vehicles, the IBM Institute for Business Value created a survey of general consumers whose primary mode of transportation is an automobile. The survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,716 American drivers (802 Urban, 469 Suburban and 445 Rural) has a margin of error for the base sample of &amp;nbsp;+/- 2.4% at the 95 percent confidence level and was fielded by Opinion Research Corporation (ORC) on &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;December 9-13, 2010&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tools enable energy savings throughout Owens Corning</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Through a combination of technical assistance, tools and training provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program (ITP), Owens Corning has achieved significant energy savings across its operations. Energy efficiency measures implemented at its Santa Clara, Calif., plant alone have resulted in significant annual savings &amp;ndash; and the company did not stop there. Owens Corning took the knowledge and know-how acquired through its work with ITP and pursued energy efficiency projects on its own. Using DOE software tools, the company conducted a plant-wide energy assessment at one of its fiberglass insulation facilities, which identified energy-savings opportunities that, when fully implemented, will reduce the plant&amp;rsquo;s total energy intensity by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, Owens Corning is a leading global producer of residential and commercial building materials, glass-fiber reinforcements and engineered materials for composite systems. A Fortune 500 Company for 56 consecutive years, Owens Corning is committed to driving sustainability by delivering solutions, transforming markets and enhancing lives. Founded in 1938, Owens Corning is a market-leading innovator of glass-fiber technology, with sales of $4.8 billion in 2009 and approximately 16,000 employees in 28 countries on five continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Owens Corning is a company that takes its commitment to energy efficiency very seriously. Each of the company&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing facilities has an appointed &amp;ldquo;energy leader&amp;rdquo; who is responsible for the efficiency of the plant&amp;rsquo;s process operations. Energy leaders collaborate with their counterparts at other plants to share ideas and best practices for saving energy and deploying new tools and methodologies to reduce energy use, as well as work closely with local utilities and vendors to implement energy-savings ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2007, Owens Corning has worked closely with DOE in its drive to improve efficiency. The partnership has proved to be incredibly successful and mutually beneficial. The company has taken full advantage of the technical assistance, expertise, and tools offered by ITP to achieve significant savings. A prime example of Owens Corning&amp;rsquo;s energy efficiency efforts is its Santa Clara plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Achieving Significant Savings in Santa Clara&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Built in 1949, the Owens Corning Santa Clara facility was the first industrial plant in the United States designed specifically to manufacture insulation. Today, the plant employs 300 people and produces approximately 250 million pounds of insulation annually. Because the plant is served by two large electric furnaces, electricity consumption is significant. The plant is also served by several pumping and fan systems, as well as two compressed air systems. Improving the efficiency of such systems, of which Owens Corning has many, can generate noteworthy energy-savings opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2007, a DOE Energy Expert performed an energy assessment on the Santa Clara plant&amp;rsquo;s pumping systems. The Energy Expert used DOE&amp;rsquo;s Pumping System Assessment Tool (PSAT) to identify several opportunities for reducing pumping system energy use, including consistent operation of the most efficient pumps, retrofitting inefficient pumps, replacing valves, and installing variable speed drives. The combined annual energy savings for pump-related improvements was estimated at more than $100,000. Subsequently, additional assessments were conducted on the plant&amp;rsquo;s compressed air and fan systems using the respective DOE software tools &amp;ndash; the Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT) and AIRMaster+. The assessments led to the implementation of several energy efficient upgrades, including the installation of variable frequency drives on fans and upgrading to a larger compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, some of the recommendations that were identified during the assessments were too costly to qualify for immediate project financing &amp;ndash; the implementation costs were too high to meet the company&amp;rsquo;s established three-year return on investment requirement. However, financial incentives provided by local utility company, Silicon Valley Power (SVP), enabled Owens Corning to pursue energy-saving measures that were generated from the assessments. SVP leveraged its Customer Directed Rebate program, awarding the Santa Clara facility approximately $250,000 in rebates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The recommendations implemented at the Santa Clara plant resulted in aggregate annual energy cost savings of about $250,000. With $250,000 in incentives from SVP and implementation costs, the Santa Clara projects yielded a 1.3-year simple payback period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applying a Successful Methodology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Large industrial companies like Owens Corning often have multiple facilities that manufacture the same product. These similar facilities provide an excellent opportunity to replicate ITP&amp;rsquo;s model for identifying and pursuing energy-savings opportunities. Since receiving its initial energy assessment in 2007, Owens Corning has applied the technical expertise, tools, and training provided by ITP to pursue additional energy efficiency efforts on its own, without direct assistance from DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2009, the company conducted a plant-wide energy assessment at one of its fiberglass insulation plants. Plant personnel evaluated the facility&amp;rsquo;s fan, pumping, compressed air, and process heating systems using DOE software tools &amp;ndash; FSAT, PSAT, AirMaster+ and the Process Heating Assessment Tool. The assessment resulted in a number of identified improvement opportunities that, when fully implemented, will result in a 12 percent reduction in the plant&amp;rsquo;s total energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The sustainability projects across Owens Corning&amp;rsquo;s operations have yielded valuable findings related to energy efficiency project planning and implementation, and have allowed the company to achieve substantial energy and cost savings. Leveraging the technical assistance, tools and resources supplied by ITP not only helped Owens Corning identify efficiency improvement opportunities, but also provided the company with the technical expertise and know-how to replicate similar projects without direct support from DOE. The success Owens Corning has achieved on its own serves as an encouraging example for other energy-conscience companies looking to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/8Pg6oI0cwQA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Research: Nanotechnologies cut cost of green energy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	World investment in renewable energy will top $2 trillion on a cumulative basis from 2010 through 2015, driven by growth in Asia, North America and Europe as these regions lead in their efforts to increase production of energy from renewable sources. Were the companies building these generating plants to utilize existing, commercially available nanotechnologies, ABI Research estimates, over the same five-year period green power producers in the solar and wind markets could save nearly $300 billion in capital expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, says research director Larry Fisher of NextGen (ABI Research&amp;rsquo;s emerging technologies research incubator), &amp;ldquo;Incorporating nanomaterials into wind turbine blades can make them stronger, lighter and more durable, so they last longer while generating more electricity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the US Department of Energy (DOE) expects world energy consumption to grow 44 percent from 2008&amp;rsquo;s 283 quadrillion BTUs to 678 quadrillion BTUs (7.15 exajoules) by 2030. This increase will be driven by growing energy demand from developing nations such as China and India. Concurrently, the monetary and environmental costs of fossil fuel-based power are making it necessary for governments around the world to shift electricity production to alternative forms of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fisher observes that, &amp;ldquo;The addition of nanomaterials to the manufacturing processes makes solar cells, wind turbines and fuel cells cheaper to produce, while improving their efficiency in generating electricity. These factors together make even more convincing the argument that we need to move our electrical production away from fossil fuels and increasingly toward renewable sources.&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABI Research anticipates that between 2010 and 2015 new solar photovoltaic installations and new wind installations implemented over the forecast period will total 652 GW (gigawatts) of new energy production. Fuel cell shipments will total more than 35 million units over that period as well, indicating that sector is on the cusp of global commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new study by ABI Research, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abiresearch.com%2Fresearch%2F1005396-Nanotechnologies_for_Green_Power_Generation&amp;amp;esheet=6565951&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Nanotechnologies+for+Green+Power+Generation&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=5744a2097232304a7432f42ab8196820" target="_blank"&gt;Nanotechnologies for Green Power Generation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abiresearch.com%2Fresearch%2F1005396&amp;amp;esheet=6565951&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abiresearch.com%2Fresearch%2F1005396&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=ae82c3d4c071b69209e0d15c67b12d80" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abiresearch.com/research/1005396&lt;/a&gt;) examines how the use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in the production of solar (photovoltaic) cells, wind turbines and blades, and fuel cells, can increase these products&amp;rsquo; efficiency in generating electricity, as well as reducing manufacturing costs and improving durability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/NHWyCpP5QUs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>General Motors, Powermat to put added 'charge' in Chevy Volt</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors and Powermat, a pioneer in wireless charging technology, announced a commercial agreement January 6 that will eliminate the need for charging cords for personal electronic devices in many future Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac products beginning mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM Ventures, the company&amp;rsquo;s venture capital subsidiary, will invest $5 million in Powermat to accelerate the technology&amp;rsquo;s development and support efforts to grow Powermat&amp;rsquo;s business globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powermat&amp;rsquo;s technology allows electronic devices &amp;ndash; smart phones, MP3 players and gaming devices &amp;ndash; to be charged safely and efficiently, according to Powermat CEO Ran Poliakine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Chevrolet Volt, conceived as a reinvention of the automobile that would help reduce America&amp;rsquo;s dependence on oil, while providing the assurance of an extended driving range, will be one of the first GM vehicles to offer this technology.&amp;nbsp; The technology is expected to revolutionize how electronic devices are charged in a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Imagine a mat or shelf where you could put your iPhone, your Droid or other personal device and charge it automatically while you commute to work, run errands or as you&amp;rsquo;re driving on a family vacation,&amp;rdquo; said Micky Bly, GM&amp;rsquo;s lead electronics executive, including infotainment, hybrids and battery electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Chevy Volt will be one of the first applications, but we intend to expand it across our vehicle portfolio,&amp;rdquo; Bly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Powermat, a private firm, was founded in 2007 and offers wireless charging products for the home in a number of retail stores, including Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Poliakine is excited to start with the Chevrolet Volt, which has swept major Car of the Year awards to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GM is among the rarest of giants in today&amp;rsquo;s business climate: a forward-thinking innovator with the courage and good sense to care about the well-being of the consumer and the well-being of our planet,&amp;rdquo; Poliakine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jon Lauckner, who helped create the Volt concept and now is President of GM Ventures, has been dreaming about a technology like Powermat for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We first developed the Volt concept car in 2006,&amp;rdquo; Lauckner said. &amp;ldquo;The intent was to revolutionize every aspect of the car, not just the propulsion system.&amp;nbsp; We had something like this in mind even then, and we think it will have widespread appeal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/c72-fQ_izxg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Mannington Mills tackles sub-metering system issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Ask the Energy Expert is an ongoing column with the intent of providing information and solutions for some of industry&amp;#39;s most pressing questions. This issue&amp;#39;s Energy Expert is Richard Miller, corporate energy manager at Mannington Mills. Miller&amp;#39;s role involves developing, coordinating and implementing the aims and objectives of Mannington Mill&amp;#39;s strategies and policies to reduce the company&amp;#39;s energy consumption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Energy Expert:&lt;br /&gt;
	I work as a facilities engineer for a mid-sized manufacturing firm and recently assumed the unofficial title of energy manager for our production unit. Lately, we have been experiencing communication gateway issues within our sub-metering system. What challenges has your company faced with its sub-metering system, and how can we capitalize on this experience at our facility? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mannington Mills is a manufacturer of residential and commercial resilient, laminate, hardwood and porcelain tile, as well as commercial carpet and rubber floor covering. In business since 1915 and family-owned for four generations, Mannington Mills operates under the mission of being &amp;ldquo;the best people to do business with in the flooring industry.&amp;rdquo; We take extreme pride in our dedication to our products, our customers and our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a leader in product innovation and environmental stewardship, our organization regards energy as a critical company resource. We view efficiency as an important element of corporate sustainability and effective energy-management strategies. As such, we have developed a rigorous energy-management plan and energy-use and intensity baselines that strengthen our commitment to energy efficiency and place heightened importance on the reduction of industrial energy intensity. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s Industrial Technologies Program, we have committed to ambitious energy intensity reduction goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metering System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Industrial organizations utilize sub-metering systems to account for and monitor the energy use of their individual facilities. Properly maintained systems allow an organization to establish metrics for these facilities and to gauge their overall energy performance. Most importantly, though, these systems facilitate the establishment of energy documentation and management systems, capable of handling data from multiple and distinct facilities, and set a precedent of explicable granularity in data reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1995, our corporate facility in Salem, N.J., was seeking to implement a metering system that would provide us with a picture of our overall and individual facility energy use. We installed 40 Schneider Electric POWERLOGIC Series 2000 Circuit Monitors throughout our campus. These multi-purpose control monitors featured real-time and demand readings, as well as energy readings and power analysis values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, the system was only set up as a means of performing cost summaries for budget allocation and was owned and operated by our accounting department. Sub-meters were not monitored for energy use or data collection, and software upgrades were not maintained. As a result, the meters fell into disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By 2008, though, were we beginning to look more closely at our corporate energy-management systems and identified our metering system as problematic. We conducted a comprehensive review of the system and quickly discovered that various control devices on four of our sub-meters were malfunctioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing the Issues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We decided to take immediate action to address these issues. We began taking regular, manual meter readings and ran server reports once a week to identify any possible defects in our sub-meters. We contacted United Electric, a local distributor, whose sales staff assembled our original system. They assisted us with a system assessment and partnered with us in a one-year system-support program to provide remote troubleshooting and onsite support for our meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These efforts continue today. We properly maintain our meters with a preventive maintenance plan that involves our staff recording real-time data and reporting any abnormalities. Another part of our maintenance plan is keeping current with upgraded series software versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our corporate management would also like to ensure that the metering system is addressed as a whole. We are currently in the process of verifying that each wire in the system is functioning and interacting with the system properly. This is being done to ensure that communication gateways and systemic network issues are also addressed. We have also identified the Schneider Electric POWER LOGIC Series 3000 meters as part of our system upgrade. Each unit will cost around $1,000 and will include all communications software and wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Mannington Mills recognizes that our metering system is vital to our operations and that sub-meters are necessary to maintaining reporting granularity and system accuracy. We feel that the system enables us to communicate to facility managers where they are, what our expectations for them are, and where we need them to go in terms of their performance. Our sub-metering system also helps us to understand energy use patterns and trends. It also helps us evaluate the performance of our facilities&amp;rsquo; equipment and systems to determine improvement potential as we move farther into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Harnessing coke oven gas: Company converts waste gas into power</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Helping to meet China&amp;rsquo;s strict emission standards, Jiangsu Tianue Energy &amp;amp; Chemical Group Company Ltd. is building a high-efficiency gas turbine power plant to utilize industrial dismissed gas into power and steam to meet increasing energy needs in the region. The power plant will be equipped with three GE aeroderivative gas turbines, which are the first LM2500+G4 units sold in China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GE&amp;rsquo;s innovative technology allows us to turn a previously environmentally harmful gas into a useful tool to produce energy for our customers. In addition, we will be able to reduce CO2 emissions by 300,000 tons per year and supply stable electricity to Pei County,&amp;rdquo; said Teng Daochun, chairman, Jiangsu Tianue Energy &amp;amp; Chemical Group Company Ltd. &amp;ldquo;This project is an important step in increasing the value of coke oven gas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	GE&amp;rsquo;s LM2500+G4 aeroderivative gas turbines will use coke oven gas (COG) as fuel and turn it into electricity for the region. COG is a byproduct of the coking manufacturing process. Among all of the current treatment methods, GE&amp;rsquo;s solution is more reliable, cleaner for the environment and uses the residual energy at a higher efficiency rate. GE also is providing a 12-year services agreement with one spare engine to ensure maximum operability at the new plant.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our LM2500+G4 is a powerful gas turbine with high efficiency, which has the potential to translate into operational savings and increased revenue potential for the customer&amp;rsquo;s operations,&amp;rdquo; said Darryl Wilson, vice president of aeroderivative gas turbines for GE Power &amp;amp; Water. &amp;ldquo;Using our aeroderivative technology for low-calorie, coke-oven gas is a technology breakthrough, and this project is another example of GE&amp;rsquo;s commitment to invest in progressive solutions to meet environmental challenges throughout the world. Through this endeavor, GE and Tianue are responding to the Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s call to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by conserving energy and making contributions to a cleaner economy in the country.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The announcement is part of a series of commitments GE has made in China. On November 9, 2010, GE announced plans to invest more than $2 billion into its efforts in China through 2012 to help tackle the country&amp;rsquo;s pressing energy and infrastructure needs. GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt announced that the company plans to commit $500 million to enhance China R&amp;amp;D capabilities and establish new Customer Innovation Centers to better serve west, north, central and south China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On the same day, as part of the $2 billion investment, GE and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), China&amp;rsquo;s top power distributor and one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest utilities, announced plans for several joint ventures to address China&amp;rsquo;s growing energy needs and to electrify its vast transportation infrastructure. These joint ventures will play a vital role in supporting the country&amp;rsquo;s energy demand through the development of a smarter grid that will help achieve environmental and economical goals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Jiangsu Tianue Energy and Chemical Group Company Ltd. is a large and advanced private enterprise group, dealing mainly in coal washing, coking, power generation, coal-gas supply, mining, etc. Formerly known as Xuzhou Huanyu Molybdenum Industry, it is the first Sino-foreign joint venture in Xuzhou. It has passed ISO9002 quality system authentication, gained coking industry access in 2008 and also passed OHSMS occupational health and safety management system authentication.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hitachi Plant Technologies develops solar-activated air conditioning system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Hitachi Plant Technologies Ltd. has recently developed an environmentally friendly solar-activated air conditioning system employing its own developed solar energy collector. The system reduces consumption of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions remarkably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hitachi Plant Technologies is actively expanding its marketing activities, targeting at local-air conditioning in buildings or district cooling facilities for the regions of the Mediterranean, the interior of North America, Western Asia and Australia, &amp;ldquo;Sunshine Belts&amp;rdquo; which are sufficiently exposed to huge amount of sunlight. The company expects to break in its sales up to 5 billions yen in fiscal year 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solar power is increasingly in focus as a source of renewable and sustainable energy, thus avoiding the use of fossil fuels. Hitachi Plant Technologies has considerable experience in a wide range of plants employing solar energy for power and heating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hitachi Plant Technologies combines this experience with its plentiful expertise in air conditioning, accumulated over many years, in the development of the solar-activated air conditioning system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This system is designed to drive a refrigerator directly with thermal energy generated from the solar energy collector to obtain chilled water for air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the key to this system, Hitachi Plant Technologies developed its own original designed high-efficiency parabola trough-type solar energy collector. The collector is improved through design features such as its simple and easily-handled structure, and the use of computer simulations to develop a design for control of displacement of the focal point in the presence of wind and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hitachi Plant Technologies supplies a total system incorporating the solar energy collector, as well as presenting proposals for combinations of energy-efficient technologies for air conditioning systems, and water treatment technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This system also has application beyond air conditioning systems, and future development is expected to involve wider application in a variety of heat sources.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Sustainability report illustrates environmental progress for electronics industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) on January 4 released the &lt;em&gt;CEA 2010 Sustainability Report&lt;/em&gt; to highlight the tremendous progress the industry has made in its green initiatives, from designing more energy efficient products to cutting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at facilities, to developing a national electronics recycling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report, an update to CEA&amp;rsquo;s first-ever sustainability report in 2008, tracks the industry&amp;rsquo;s green efforts throughout a consumer electronics (CE) product&amp;rsquo;s entire life cycle. The &lt;em&gt;CEA 2010 Sustainability Report &lt;/em&gt;contains 21 separate case studies from a variety of CE companies illustrating progress in their environmental efforts. The report further provides transparency on green practices across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The consumer electronics industry is committed to greening its products and practices for the benefit of consumers, communities and the overall environment,&amp;rdquo; said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. &amp;ldquo;In the past three years, we&amp;rsquo;ve made great strides in our environmental efforts, by creating more green products, improving energy efficiency and deepening our commitment to electronics recycling. We know there is work remaining, and we will press forward with these initiatives in 2011 and beyond.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some highlights of environmental progress evidenced in the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Greener designs:&lt;/strong&gt;Industry-wide unit sales of U.S. products registered with EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) grew by 10 percent in 2009, to a total of 48.5 million products. Individual companies also made noteworthy milestones in green design. One manufacturer, for instance, conducted a comprehensive life cycle analysis for every product it ships to determine where greenhouse gases are created. After discovering 97 percent of the emission derived from manufacturing and product use, the company focused on designing new products that use less material, smaller packaging, and are as energy efficient and recyclable as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Green packaging&lt;/strong&gt;: Many consumer electronics companies are switching to renewable materials, including bio-based plastics, or recyclable materials instead of clamshell packaging and are looking to reduce the amount of packaging they use. For instance, one video service provider consolidated its shipments and decreased its use of cartons by more than one million in 2009 &amp;mdash; a 75 percent reduction from the previous year. In 2011, all of the providers&amp;rsquo; products will be packed with 100 percent recyclable materials.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More efficient facilities:&lt;/strong&gt;Many manufacturers have set ambitious goals for reducing GHG at their facilities. Meanwhile, other companies have launched efforts to cut power consumption at their data centers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More energy efficient products:&lt;/strong&gt;According to the EPA, 27,000 CE product models currently meet ENERGY STAR specifications. The average energy savings of ENERGY STAR electronics devices range from 20 to 55 percent. An example of this progress is one semiconductor design company created a chip that can reduce its GHG by up to 40 percent by combining the processing and graphics processing units and the Northbridge chipset onto a single chip.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;eCycling: &lt;/strong&gt;The consumer electronics industry recycled 200 million pounds in 2009, and industry supports more than 5,000 permanent collection sites nationwide. Some examples of these efforts include one CE retailer collecting 100 million pounds at its 1,200 U.S. locations and one computer manufacturer operating an eCycling program at more than 2,200 U.S. Goodwill sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The CE industry&amp;rsquo;s commitment to sustainability is unmistakable,&amp;rdquo; said Walter Alcorn, CEA&amp;rsquo;s vice president of environmental affairs and industry sustainability. &amp;ldquo;More and more, our member companies are finding what makes good environmental sense also makes good business sense in the form of reduced costs and invigorated employees. Our sustainability efforts will continue in earnest this year, and CEA will continue to provide the resources to member companies to help bolster these initiatives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The full report is available at &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CE.org%2Fgreen&amp;amp;esheet=6560590&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.CE.org%2Fgreen&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=4c90175f6d8e2c8eb37727963e91ea88" target="_blank"&gt;www.CE.org/green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About CEA:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is the preeminent trade association promoting growth in the $170 billion U.S. consumer electronics industry. More than 2,000 companies enjoy the benefits of CEA membership, including legislative advocacy, market research, technical training and education, industry promotion, standards development and the fostering of business and strategic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/hlS_godXA7s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The history of electric vehicles: A 21st-century timeline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The past decade has been the most significant 10-year period for electric vehicles (EVs) since the first 10 years of the 20th century, when 38 percent of cars in 1900 were &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/in-1917-electric-vehicles-reigned-and-edison-charged-them/" jquery1293737240702="8"&gt;charging up, many with the aid of Thomas Edison-designed electric technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The renewed excitement that EVs garnered among carmakers in the late 1990s gave way to &amp;hellip; almost nothing. But in the past few years, EVs have suddenly been reborn, and they&amp;rsquo;re now becoming a central aspect of development strategy for major car manufacturers. (&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-30/tesla-says-electric-car-battery-plan-means-profit-at-low-volume.html" jquery1293737240702="9"&gt;Just today, Tesla Motors said&lt;/a&gt; that cheaper batteries will mean its $57,000 Model S sedan, which uses cells like those in laptops, can turn a profit with fewer unit sales).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DuPont earns prestigious sustainability award for recycling program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont recently received the 2010 Premio ECO Award in the Product Sustainability category for its role in a closed-loop recycling process for agrochemical multilayer bottles.&amp;nbsp;DuPont Latin America president Eduardo Wanick accepted the award during an international ceremony in S&amp;auml;o Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;Virtuous Cycle using Fusabond&amp;rdquo; project relies on the unique characteristic of DuPont&amp;nbsp;Fusabond&amp;nbsp;coupling agent to compatibilize and bond dissimilar polymers in the recycling process. Fusabond also improves impact resistance, surface finish and processability of parts and films so the recycled product can be used to form other articles with little material loss and great added value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right" style="height: 253px" width="217"&gt;

		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				In the award-winning &amp;ldquo;Virtuous Cycle using Fusabond&amp;rdquo; program, agrochemical multilayer bottles are recycled into high-value industrial applications - shown here in flexible corrugated pipes.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Empty agricultural chemical packaging is collected by the National Institute for the Processing of Empty Packaging (inPEV), launched by government mandate and initially supported by 22 founding companies, including DuPont.&amp;nbsp;Since 2002, more than 150,000 tons of empty packaging has been collected, eliminating the need for 374,000 barrels of crude oil and more than 160,000 tons of CO2 equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	Brazil is a leader in collecting used agricultural chemical packaging with a 95 percent&amp;nbsp;collection rate, compared with Canada (73%), Germany (76%), France (66%) and the United States&amp;nbsp;(30%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	The ECO Award, organized by Amcham (American Chamber of Commerce) and newspaper Valor Economico, was launched in 1982 and awards socially responsible companies and emerging sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" alt="" border="0" hspace="2" src="http://www2.dupont.com/Media_Center/en_US/assets/images/2010/dn_123010_photo_white_agrochemical_bottle.jpg" title="" /&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is a great honor to be recognized not only for the environmental impact of this recycling program, but for the science behind it,&amp;quot; Eduardo said. &amp;quot;Multilayer containers pose a great recycling challenge due to the variety of plastic materials used in their construction. Innovative programs such as these evolve when the entire value chain is engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;DuPont contributes to global food production by providing products and services that help ensure food safety, higher crop yields and healthier foods,&amp;rdquo; Eduardo said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;DuPont is uniquely focused across the value chain allowing us to introduce customized solutions based on our holistic view of global food production. Reducing the negative effects on the environment requires collaborative innovation throughout the value chain focused on a common goal of a sustainable future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/1yz6e8qaJNI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Fiat factory in India improves its power quality, productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A power quality solution has boosted the power factor at a state-of-the-art Fiat car factory in India to 99.5 percent, and brought significant productivity benefits in terms of better welding quality and improved network stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution comprises two ABB power technologies &amp;ndash; STATCON and DYNACOMP &amp;ndash; that provide fast and smooth dynamic reactive power compensation and solve a variety of industrial network power quality problems associated with fast and variable loads such as low power factor, voltage sags, flicker and high harmonic levels.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Fiat factory at Pune has been in operation since 2007 and is among the most modern automotive production facilities in India, although the reactive and rapidly fluctuating loads in its various manufacturing shops had been seriously affecting power quality.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Spot welding in particular causes short, sudden bursts of current that create disturbances in the power network. The disturbances in turn reduce welding quality and lead to higher levels of rejects and electrode wastage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ABB solution has successfully helped to achieve an impressive power factor of almost 100 percent even in the spot welding shop, which is a classic example of an application continuously subjected to fast dynamic reactive loads.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Besides network stability and energy savings, the improved power factor has also reduced maintenance in the welding shop and lowered the wastage of costly electrodes. In addition, the solution&amp;rsquo;s innovative power save mode restarts automatically when loads are sensed, thereby saving on auxiliary power and eliminating manual starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/12/28/quick/19e3b1bb-50d5-474d-bdea-50fa5d202b35_fiat.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. A line of ABB IRB 6400 robots performing spot welding in an automotive factory. Spot welding produces voltage spikes that require reactive power compensation to maintain the efficiency of the factory&amp;rsquo;s power network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	STATCON is a technology based on IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor &amp;ndash; a fast switching and highly efficient power semiconductor) that provides ultrafast dynamic reactive power compensation with a response time of only 20 to 30 milliseconds. It provides smooth, step-less compensation by generating inductive or capacitive power, and is an ideal solution for improving power quality in weak networks. Typical applications include railways, welding, rolling mills, furnaces and similar industrial loads that rapidly draw reactive power.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	STATCON was designed and developed by ABB India. The latest generation features control, operational, optimization, protection diagnostics and user interface enhancements that meet the market&amp;rsquo;s growing needs for advanced functionality. It is the only reactive power compensator to be approved for use on India&amp;rsquo;s railways.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to STATCON, the ABB solution includes DYNACOMP, an advanced thyristor-switched capacitor that provides ultra-rapid and transient-free power factor compensation for the low voltage network. A total of 23 DYNACOMP panels of various power ratings were installed at substations that feed the powertrain, body-in-white, paint and assembly shops, as well as the R&amp;amp;D facility and utility systems.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The result of the ABB solution has been the stabilization of the site&amp;rsquo;s power network, a significant decrease in power consumption, the avoidance of penalties from the grid operator for consuming excessive amounts of reactive power, improvements in welding consistency and productivity, and less maintenance in the welding shop.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Fiat India is a 50-50 joint venture between Fiat and Tata Motors. The factory has the capacity to produce up to 100,000 cars and 200,000 engines a year.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>FERC conference to advance smart grid interoperability standards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On December 21, 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced it will hold a technical conference* on smart grid interoperability standards. The purpose of the technical conference is to obtain further information to aid FERC&amp;#39;s determination of whether there is &amp;quot;sufficient consensus&amp;quot; that the five families of standards posted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology are ready for the commission&amp;#39;s consideration in a rulemaking proceeding, as directed by section 1305(d) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The agenda for the conference will be issued in a subsequent notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The FERC technical conference represents an essential next step in the realization of the Smart Grid interoperability framework,&amp;quot; said George Arnold, the national coordinator for smart grid interoperability at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;This is an important milestone, since under the Energy Independence and Security Act, FERC must make an independent determination of whether NIST&amp;#39;s work has led to sufficient consensus before it can initiate a rulemaking.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;* Docket No. RM11-2-000. The technical conference will be held at 1 p.m. January 31, 2011, at FERC headquarters at 888 First Street NE, Washington, D.C., and is open to the public. For more information, visit the &lt;a href="http://www.ferc.gov/"&gt;Event Calendar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/4pJa-x9FyNY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mark C. McCullough has been named executive vice president of generation for American Electric Power, effective January 1, 2011. He has been senior vice president for fossil and hydro generation since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	McCullough will succeed Nicholas K. Akins, who was elected president of the company beginning January 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his new position, McCullough will have responsibility for the management of AEP&amp;#39;s fossil, hydro and wind generating units. This includes engineering, construction and operation of generating units, and activities related to fuel procurement and emission monitoring and logistics. He will report to Akins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Mark has clearly demonstrated the leadership skills and technical knowledge needed to lead our power generation activities,&amp;quot; Akins said. &amp;quot;He is the right person to address the strategic and operational objectives for our fleet while ensuring that our customers have an efficient and reliable supply of energy available to them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	McCullough, 51, has worked his entire career at AEP. He joined the company in 1981 at AEP&amp;#39;s Tanners Creek Plant in Lawrenceburg, Ind. He held a variety of positions at Tanners Creek, including maintenance superintendent and operation superintendent, before being named assistant plant manager at AEP&amp;#39;s Amos Plant in St. Albans, W.Va., in 1994. From 1995 to 1997, McCullough was manager, Northern Region Service Organization, responsible for the management of scheduled outages and major project work for more than 10,000 megawatts of coal-fueled generation. In 1997, he was named manager, strategic planning, Power Generation, leading the AEP Generation merger team and developing, coordinating and tracking strategic initiatives for AEP&amp;#39;s Power Generation Group. McCullough was named region director, Region 2, Wholesale Generation with responsibility for AEP&amp;#39;s generation in Ohio and West Virginia in 2000. He was named region director &amp;ndash; Ohio, unregulated generation in 2002 and then became vice president, fossil and hydro generation &amp;ndash; baseload assets in 2003. In 2008, he was named senior vice president &amp;ndash; fossil and hydro generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	McCullough has a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from Rose Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	American Electric Power is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, delivering electricity to more than 5 million customers in 11 states. AEP ranks among the nation&amp;#39;s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation&amp;#39;s largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile network that includes more 765-kilovolt extra-high voltage transmission lines than all other U.S. transmission systems combined. AEP&amp;#39;s transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in ERCOT, the transmission system that covers much of Texas. AEP&amp;#39;s utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas).

            <title>Caterpillar facilities achieve zero waste to landfill in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In line with Caterpillar Inc.&amp;#39;s global commitment to sustainable development, two Caterpillar facilities achieved zero waste to landfill in 2010. The Caterpillar Remanufacturing &amp;amp; Components Division United Kingdom Hose Assembly (UKHA) plant in Leicester, England, and the Caterpillar Logistics Services (Cat Logistics) Desford, England operations have reached 100 percent recycling in their respective facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Caterpillar recognizes that providing sustainable solutions starts with having sustainable operations. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve established corporate long-term goals focused on sustainability for all of our operations worldwide,&amp;quot; said Caterpillar chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman. &amp;quot;One of those operational goals is to eliminate waste by reducing waste generation and reusing or recycling all that remains.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Cat Logistics Desford facility consists of several buildings housing both warehouse operations and administrative offices. It provides a wide range of logistics services to many different customers and distributes materials worldwide. A global operation of this magnitude generates tons of waste each year, and the facility has had a longstanding recycling program in place. In 2008, a project team set the goal of zero landfill and 100-percent of waste recycled. Implemented in March 2009, the new processes quickly improved recycling percentages to such an extent that on October 2010, the site was able to record one full year of 100-percent recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cat Logistics&amp;#39; site services manager, Paul Morris, applauds the remarkable achievement. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re extremely proud of the results of this project. It&amp;#39;s a great thing for the environment but it&amp;#39;s also great for our business. We&amp;#39;ve taken what used to be a cost and turned it into an asset.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cat Logistics Desford facility results include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Segregation of waste has increased considerably from an original six different streams to more than 30 today and so increasing recycling opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Many of the waste streams are now baled/bundled. Baling waste has many advantages including increased weight per volume and reduced transportation costs. The baling has reduced transportation involved by 50-percent when moving waste off site. The best example is shipping cardboard, which was previously only two tons per vehicle, and baling has increased loads to 22 tons per vehicle &amp;ndash; an 11-fold improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Office waste was originally all collected in a single bin and sent to landfill. The introduction of smaller desktop bins has encouraged everyone to generate less waste, and segregated collection points has ensured all material is recycled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Through increased knowledge of the recycling industry, the facility has been able to increase recycling and prepare waste to ensure it can be recycled and the best price obtained.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A $183,984 (pounds Sterling 116,372) cost saving was realized in the first year following implementation of the new processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Desford facility achievements have been recognized throughout England. It has received the Green Apple Award from The Green Organization and reached the finals of the National Recycling Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The UKHA facility achieved zero landfill by effectively increasing the facility&amp;#39;s recycling rate by an additional 25 to 30 percent from previous years. &amp;quot;This was a great team effort by everyone at UKHA to achieve 100-percent facility recycling in 2010,&amp;quot; said Pete Lee, UKHA Environmental Health and Safety Specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	UKHA project results include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A total waste management system was developed to maximize revenues generated from recyclables and to start recycling waste rubber hydraulic hoses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A system was created to ensure UKHA reaches and maintains 100-percent facility recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The environmental metrics reporting procedure was simplified and streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A $15,562 (pounds 9,843) cost savings has been realized since the implementation of the project in September 2009.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>American Foods Group honored for excellence in energy management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	American Foods Group (AFG) of &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Green Bay, Wis.&lt;/span&gt; was recently honored for earning the prestigious Wisconsin Governor&amp;#39;s Award for Excellence in Energy Management. This award is in recognition of American Foods Group&amp;#39;s dedication to adopt energy-efficient and sustainable practices in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt;. AFG, home to 1,500 employees, harvests 2,100 head of cattle daily and sends its meat products to grocery stores and food service establishments nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the help of Focus on Energy, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s statewide program for energy efficiency and renewable energy, in partnership with &lt;a href="http://www.wisconsinpublicservice.com/"&gt;Wisconsin Public Service&lt;/a&gt; and more than &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$437,000&lt;/span&gt; in financial incentives, the beef processor has launched aggressive energy saving efforts and continues to investigate new technologies and find more ways to save energy throughout its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2009, American Foods Group has saved more than four million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity and 234,000 therms of natural gas annually&amp;mdash;enough energy to power 650 Wisconsin homes for a year. The company will also benefit from &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$572,000&lt;/span&gt; in savings on its energy bills each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reduce energy usage American Foods Group implemented several energy-efficiency projects at its plant including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Installing a ThermoSorber, which uses steam to heat water and to cool liquid ammonia. Since AFG uses large amounts of hot water and has a large ammonia refrigeration system this technology has saved the company &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$10,000&lt;/span&gt; per month in energy costs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Utilizing a condensing economizer on two of its boilers to recover waste heat and reuse it in the boiler make-up water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Upgrading to energy-efficient lighting and installing occupancy sensors throughout its warehouse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Installing an anaerobic digester that is fueled by paunch manure from the harvested cattle. The digester, equipped with two 600-kilowatt generator sets, can produce 1,200 kilowatts of electricity per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Starting an energy management team and making energy efficiency a key consideration in all project planning.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Attending Focus on Energy training courses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keeping up with preventive maintenance which improves equipment operating efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Completing numerous feasibility studies to examine its systems and find custom solutions to save energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The annual environmental benefits of the American Foods Group efficiency efforts are equivalent to offsetting more than 12,000 barrels of oil from being burned &amp;ndash; eliminating four million pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) from being released into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Energy efficiency has really helped our bottom line,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Bucky Derouin&lt;/span&gt;, plant engineer at American Foods Group. &amp;quot;We started an energy team eight years ago and it&amp;#39;s been very rewarding to see all that we&amp;#39;ve accomplished. Focus has been a big help doing a lot of the legwork and research on projects.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And AFG isn&amp;#39;t stopping there. Its energy management team continues to move forward, identifying and acting on new opportunities with Focus on Energy and the &lt;a href="http://www.energy.gov/"&gt;U.S. Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re proud to honor American Foods Group with the Governor&amp;#39;s Award for Excellence in Energy Management,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Ken Williams&lt;/span&gt;, Focus on Energy&amp;#39;s business programs director. &amp;quot;We applaud their commitment to efficiency and recognize them as positive examples for other businesses to follow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2001, Focus on Energy has delivered cost effective energy solutions to &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt; consumers, farms, and businesses. Focus can help businesses identify and evaluate energy saving opportunities, develop energy management plans, and arrange technical training opportunities about energy conservation &amp;ndash; helping improve bottom lines and lower operating cost.

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About American Foods Group&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	American Foods Group&amp;#39;s growth in the beef industry has made them an efficient partner for customers. AFG is a privately-held family business. Even with its growth and success, one thing has remained the same, AFG is a tight-knit group of hard working people who care about its customers, and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/VQMTODWNxsE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

					&lt;span class="s"&gt;Testing vehicles and solar-powered charging station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Conducted in real-world urban transportation environments, the program will focus on motorcycles, automobiles and power products based on electromotive technologies. The comprehensive program will also use advanced communications &amp;amp; telematics and solar-powered charging technologies to explore future forms of personal mobility and their potential of CO2 emissions reduction.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major objectives of the Electric Vehicle Testing Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In March 2009, Honda and Saitama Prefecture concluded an agreement to collaborate on environmental issues. Based on this agreement, Honda will start an Electric Vehicle Testing Program in the cities of Saitama, Kumagaya and Chichibu that features advanced electromotive technology and communications &amp;amp; telematics to realize a low-carbon mobility society in the future. The program will study the following:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="566"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr align="left" valign="center"&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="15"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" height="14" src="http://world.honda.com/news/2010/image/shiromaru.gif" width="11" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

            <title>Arizona Public Service, SunEdison announce construction of 10-megawatt solar power plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SunEdison, a subsidiary of MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., and Arizona Public Service Company on December 16 announced construction of a utility-scale photovoltaic solar power plant located two miles north of the Prescott Regional Airport. SunEdison will own and operate the plant with APS purchasing the entire output. APS estimates the 10-megawatt facility can provide enough power to meet the annual energy needs of 2,500 Arizona customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The announcement event, held at the Hassayampa Inn in Prescott, spotlighted the new solar deployment, which is anticipated to become active in the fall of 2011. The plant is expected to generate more than 25 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean energy in its first year of operation alone and approximately 653 million kWh over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;APS&amp;rsquo;s investments in renewable energy &amp;ndash; well-diversified by technology, ownership, size and location &amp;ndash; are forging a sustainable energy future for Arizona,&amp;rdquo; said Don Robinson, APS president and chief operating officer. &amp;ldquo;With five solar facilities operating or under construction, Prescott is becoming an important hub for solar development. It is an ideal location because of its abundant sunshine, cooler weather, available land and access to the transmission system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	APS&amp;rsquo;s decade-long history of solar in Prescott includes a 194-kilowatt system at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (completed in 2001), a small system on the roof of Prescott College (completed in 2004) and a 3.6-megawatt plant near the Prescott Regional Airport (completed in 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this month, APS and SunEdison announced plans for two other Arizona solar plants, a 20-megawatt facility in Chino Valley &amp;ndash; another Prescott-area solar plant &amp;ndash; and a 17-megawatt facility in Hyder. Those plants also will be developed by SunEdison. However, instead of purchasing the power, APS will own the facilities after construction is completed. With these two solar plants plus today&amp;rsquo;s announcement, APS&amp;rsquo;s renewable portfolio totals approximately 851 megawatts, of which 282 is in operation and serving customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;SunEdison offers smart, cost effective, solar solutions that utilities have come to expect and trust,&amp;rdquo; said Carlos Domenech, president of SunEdison. &amp;ldquo;We have a global demonstrated utility track record and welcome the opportunity to partner with a progressive utility like APS.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2004, SunEdison has deployed close to 100 megawatts of utility-scale solar including the recently activated 70-megawatt solar power plant in Rovigo, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About SunEdison &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	SunEdison is a global provider of solar energy services. The company develops, finances, installs and operates distributed power plants using proven photovoltaic technologies, delivering fully managed, predictably priced solar energy services for its commercial, government and utility customers. In 2009, SunEdison delivered more kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy than any other solar services provider in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About MEMC &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	MEMC is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of wafers and related intermediate products to the semiconductor and solar industries. MEMC has been a pioneer in the design and development of wafer technologies over the past 50 years. With R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia, MEMC enables the next generation of high performance semiconductor devices and solar cells. With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC is now a developer of solar power projects and North America&amp;#39;s largest solar energy services provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About APS &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	APS, Arizona&amp;#39;s largest and longest-serving electric utility, serves more than 1.1 million customers in 11 of the state&amp;#39;s 15 counties. With headquarters in Phoenix, APS is the principal subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/vhfpKsPODJM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Crown Equipment recognized by EPA for environmental stewardship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Crown Equipment Corporation, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading forklift manufacturers, was recently recognized for its sustainability efforts by earning Ohio&amp;rsquo;s annual award for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship. Crown&amp;rsquo;s New Knoxville, Ohio, manufacturing facility received the award for accomplishing zero landfill waste output and achieving ISO 14001 Certificate of Registration. This is the third year Crown has received the award for its sustainability initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse, Chris Korleski, director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, recognized Crown&amp;rsquo;s commitment to minimizing waste, managing energy and maximizing lifespan. Crown is one of only two winners selected from a number of Ohio corporations, nonprofit organizations and state government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Winners of the award are selected based on a sound track record of environmental compliance and a commitment to go above and beyond regulations to improve environmental performance; a mature Environmental Management System that has been integrated into core business functions; aggressive environmental performance goals; and a process for communicating with the local community about program activities and progress on performance goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These award winners employ forward-thinking individuals and have developed innovative concepts for waste reduction and prevention that can serve as examples for other manufacturing facilities,&amp;rdquo; Korleski said. &amp;ldquo;They have shown a commitment to being good environmental stewards, protecting Ohio&amp;#39;s environment and natural resources, increasing company efficiency and improving the quality of life and the environment in local communities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown was previously honored by the Ohio EPA in 1992 and 2008, and has been recognized at the federal level in 2004 and 2005 as part of the U.S. EPA&amp;rsquo;s Waste Minimization Partner and National Partnership for Environmental Priorities programs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s New Knoxville, Ohio, facility achieved zero landfill status in late 2009. The 40,000-square-foot facility, which manufactures electric motors and plastic parts, recycles 96 percent of its waste. The remaining four percent (less than 1 ton per month) is converted into energy at a state-of-the art, waste-to-energy facility. Crown was also able to reduce plant usage by six percent. Additionally, the New Knoxville plant now uses 30 percent recycled-content paper and environmentally friendly cleaners. The facility later received ISO 14001 certification in January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of the most important steps in achieving zero landfill status and receiving ISO 14001 certification is creating an open channel for internal communication. To a great extent, achieving these types of goals depends on the level of employee buy-in and involvement,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Duffy, director of corporate environmental and manufacturing safety at Crown Equipment Corporation. &amp;ldquo;This award could not have been achieved without the hard work and dedication of the New Knoxville plant employees. They took ownership of the initiative and kept the momentum going.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tonja Hardin, Crown environmental administrator, accepted the award on Crown&amp;rsquo;s behalf, along with plant employees Troy Flenar, Paula Fischer and Dorothy Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability is evident throughout numerous aspects of its operations. The company releases an annual Crown ecologic Report highlighting the company&amp;rsquo;s sustainability initiatives and accomplishments. To download a copy of the 2009 report, visit &lt;a href="http://www.crown.com/"&gt;www.crown.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Ohio Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since 1986, the Ohio EPA has coordinated the Annual Governor&amp;rsquo;s Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention to recognize companies and organizations that have made outstanding achievement in reducing pollution through source reduction of the recycling of waste. Ultimately, these efforts help protect Ohio&amp;rsquo;s environment and public health. In 2008, the Awards were renamed the Ohio Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship to broaden the program&amp;rsquo;s scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Johnson Controls helps others â and Itself â with energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For Johnson Controls of Milwaukee &amp;ndash; a company that offers products and services to dramatically improve energy efficiency in buildings &amp;ndash; the commitment to sustainability dates back to the company&amp;#39;s roots in 1885 with the invention of the first electric room thermostat. The company focuses on its own environmental performance with the same discipline that it applies with its customers, reviewing operations and supply chain to identify continuous improvement opportunities to make products in more earth-friendly ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the improvements at Johnson Controls have come to fruition by using the company&amp;#39;s own resources. To record, track, forecast, and report energy use and greenhouse gas emissions across its global operations, Johnson Controls uses its own information technology &amp;ndash; specifically, the company&amp;#39;s Energy and Emissions Management System. At its global headquarters, Johnson Controls is using its new Sustainability Management System to integrate solar energy generation sub-systems with its building management system to provide real-time monitoring, metering, and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the company&amp;#39;s Energy Hunt training and continuous improvement drives culture change toward more efficient energy use and waste elimination. In 2009, 137 low- or no-cost projects resulted in more than $2.5 million in savings. Another 135 projects are in progress in 2010. These projects have earned Johnson Controls accolades from the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s Industrial Technologies Program (ITP), which recently bestowed an Energy Saver Award on the company for realizing significant energy savings after implementing recommendations that were identified during an ITP-sponsored energy assessment. Johnson Controls&amp;#39; Red Oak, Iowa, facility achieved the award by saving more than 10,100 million British thermal units, equaling 9.9 percent total energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>California carpet manufacturer on a sustainability 'mission'</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As the largest commercial carpet manufacturer in California, Bentley Prince Street produces and ships more than four million yards of carpet each year at its 280,000-square-foot facility. At its City of Industry manufacturing plant, Bentley Prince Street is rapidly becoming recognized for its industry-leading sustainability practices, including a philosophy titled &amp;quot;Mission Zero.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Anthony Minite, president of Bentley Prince Street, the goal of Mission Zero is to eliminate any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020. It is also a way for Bentley Prince Street to influence other manufacturers to take action by demonstrating what the manufacturing sector can &amp;ndash; and should &amp;ndash; be doing to help the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through strategies that encompass manufacturing processes, product innovations, and renewable energy use, Bentley Prince Street has produced some impressive numbers regarding industrial sustainability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Renewable sources provide 100 percent of electrical energy requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste sent to landfills has been reduced by 97 percent since 1994&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Absolute greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 48 percent since 1996&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water use per unit has been reduced by 52 percent since 1994&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Energy use per unit has been reduced by 40 percent since 1994&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Nitrogen oxide has been reduced by 66 percent since 1996.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bentley Prince Street is committed to sustainable commerce and innovations to integrate style and function with environmental practices. With the carpet industry&amp;#39;s most comprehensive vertical carpet manufacturing facility, the company maintains third-party certification to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 quality management system and the ISO 14001 environmental management system. Additionally, Bentley Prince Street was just accepted as a Superior Energy Performance (SEP) pilot plant within the California Energy Management Demonstration project that is being supported by the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s Industrial Technologies Program. As a demonstration site, Bentley Prince Street will test the elements of SEP, a forthcoming American National Standards Institute-accredited energy management certification program currently under development by the U.S. Council for Energy-Efficient Manufacturing.

            <title>General Motors surpasses landfill-free facilities commitment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors said December 13 that 52 percent of its worldwide facilities are now landfill-free, meaning all waste generated from normal operations is reused, recycled or converted to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM now has 76 landfill-free facilities, achieving a global operations commitment established in 2008 to convert 50 percent of its 145 plants to landfill-free status by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re committed to reducing our environmental impact,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Mike Robinson&lt;/span&gt;, vice president of Environment, Energy and Safety Policy at GM. &amp;quot;Whether it&amp;#39;s a facility that&amp;#39;s already achieved landfill-free status or one of the many that are nearly there, every site is serious about finding ways to reduce and reuse waste.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM employees focus first on decreasing the amount of waste generated, and then work to recycle the unavoidable waste. This year alone, GM has recycled or reused 2.5 million tons of waste materials at its plants worldwide &amp;ndash; enough to fill 6.8 million extended-cab pickup trucks that, if parked end-to-end, would stretch around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through this annual recycling rate, it is estimated that GM has eliminated 8.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from entering the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all about being creative, lean and rethinking traditional manufacturing processes,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;John Bradburn&lt;/span&gt;, manager of GM&amp;#39;s waste-reduction efforts. &amp;quot;When you think of what it would take for a family of four to not produce any trash for a year, that&amp;#39;s quite a task. This is 76 sites around the world and about 70,000 employees committed to the cause.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM&amp;#39;s first facility to achieve landfill-free status was an engine plant in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Flint, Mich.&lt;/span&gt;, in 2005. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM plants monitor, measure and report monthly on how they perform against waste-reduction goals. This data, which set the stage for the landfill-free initiative, shows what materials are being generated, reused and recycled, and reveals areas for improvement. The resulting insight helped form a process that enables facilities to replicate best practices globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, more than 97 percent of waste materials from GM&amp;#39;s zero-landfill plants are recycled or reused and less than 3 percent is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities, replacing fossil fuels. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I believe our employees were willing to engage because they could relate to what it means,&amp;quot; said Bradburn. &amp;quot;People don&amp;#39;t want to be wasteful; they want to help the environment. It&amp;#39;s become a sense of pride for those that work at those facilities, and it reflects in quality and throughput.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Larry Chalfan&lt;/span&gt;, founder and now senior adviser of the &lt;a href="http://www.zerowaste.org/"&gt;Zero Waste Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;This is another environmental leadership move for GM. In all of my experience, there are few companies that have taken zero waste to this level. GM&amp;#39;s workforce &amp;ndash; from the assembly line to the executives -- should be recognized for their dedication and commitment to be efficient and reduce their environmental impact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Critical to the landfill-free designation is the ability for GM to turn material byproducts from routine manufacturing operations into new-vehicle components. &amp;nbsp;Plant managers view this waste as potentially useful and marketable, and they work with their teams and suppliers to develop these closed-loop systems. Other operational waste comes full circle, as well, and is often recycled into plant supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cardboard shipping materials from the GM &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Marion Stamping&lt;/span&gt; and Fort Wayne Assembly plants are recycled into sound-absorber material in the Buick Lacrosse&amp;#39;s headliner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plastic caps and shipping aids from the Fort Wayne facility are converted into radiator shrouds for the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups built at the plant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tires from vehicle performance testing at Milford Proving Ground are shredded and used in the manufacturing of air and water baffles for a variety of GM vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Paint sludge from the Lansing Grand River plant is turned into plastic material and used for shipping containers durable enough to hold Chevrolet Volt and Cruze engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In addition to the environmental benefits, recycling provides a strong business case,&amp;quot; said Robinson. &amp;quot;GM has generated more than &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$2.5 billion&lt;/span&gt; in revenue since 2007 through its various recycling activities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, metals from stamping and powertrain operations are valuable, especially considering the amount GM generates. What metal grindings and scraps GM doesn&amp;#39;t re-melt or reuse are sold to third parties like foundries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM was one of the first organizations &amp;ndash; and to date is the only auto manufacturer &amp;ndash; inducted into the U.S. EPA WasteWise Hall of Fame, which recognizes continued outstanding waste reduction. GM&amp;#39;s worldwide facilities combined recycle 90 percent of the waste they generate. The company has reduced total non-recycled waste 75 percent between 2000 and 2010 at manufacturing sites around the world. During the last five years, it decreased waste generated per vehicle by 28 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM has made great progress in reducing its environmental impact. In November, Chevrolet announced a &lt;a href="http://www.chevycarbonreduction.com/"&gt;multi-year commitment&lt;/a&gt; to invest &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$40 million&lt;/span&gt; in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce another 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/XbXX6ZMH3b4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Expanded use of nuclear energy will advance energy security, tech leadership and exports</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nuclear power is a great export opportunity for America, but U.S. reactor suppliers like GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) face unique hurdles in the global marketplace because they compete with companies owned or supported by foreign governments, according to GEH Chairman Jack Fuller. Fuller, a participant in the bipartisan New Millennium Nuclear Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., on December 7, released the following statement about the industry&amp;rsquo;s future prospects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;America invented civilian nuclear technology, and American companies remain at the forefront of nuclear technology development. GEH, for example, is licensing and investing in advanced nuclear technologies. GEH is developing even more advanced Generation IV reactor technology, including small modular reactors that can reduce the initial capital costs of a nuclear power plant. GEH also is developing nuclear recycling technology to extract more energy from nuclear fuel and dramatically reduce the long-term radioactivity of used fuel &amp;ndash; an advanced technology that is smarter, safer, more efficient and a U.S. innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;America and the world can benefit from advanced U.S. nuclear power technology but only if government levels the playing field for U.S. companies. A nuclear energy policy partnership, led by Sens. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) and Tom Carper (D-Delaware) will help drive policy decisions that will launch renewed expansion of nuclear power in the United States and, if done right, the reemergence of America as a nuclear energy technology export powerhouse. The economic and national security benefits of a robust domestic civilian nuclear power industry cannot be overstated. In order for the United States to lead the conversation on non-proliferation, it is critical that the domestic nuclear industry is strong and that it is selling into the countries that are moving forward with new plants. It behooves the U.S. government to adopt policies that strengthen the ability of U.S. companies to compete internationally &amp;ndash; and thereby contribute to economic growth and job creation here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The partnership, which includes experts from Wall Street, also can potentially help create a new financing model to support reactor construction. The cost of electricity from nuclear energy is among the lowest from any fuel source, but the initial capital investments required are daunting. Loan guarantees and other tools that lower the financial barriers to plant construction are investments in the future that will yield dividends for decades to come in the form of economical and reliable low-carbon energy for America&amp;rsquo;s homes and factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the global race for energy technology leadership, America is still a leading innovator of nuclear energy technology, but with other nations modernizing their power infrastructure at a more rapid pace, we need to quicken ours to continue a leadership role. Let&amp;rsquo;s take stock as we have many inherent advantages. U.S. prowess in nuclear engineering, technology development and plant management is still the best in the world. The newly elected 112th Congress has a golden opportunity to set America on a new course. With the right policies in place, America can capitalize on her advantages, build new power plants here in the United States &amp;ndash; the surest route to greater U.S. energy security &amp;ndash; and start exporting high value-added energy technology to the rest of the world. This week&amp;rsquo;s summit will begin charting a roadmap for renewal in the U.S. power sector. That&amp;rsquo;s something policy makers in both parties can agree on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The New Millennium Nuclear Energy Summit was organized by the Idaho National Laboratory and Third Way, a Washington, D.C., think tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Wilmington, N.C., GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) is a world-leading provider of advanced reactors and nuclear services. Established in June 2007, GEH is a global nuclear alliance created by GE and Hitachi to serve the global nuclear industry. The nuclear alliance executes a single, strategic vision to create a broader portfolio of solutions, expanding its capabilities for new reactor and service opportunities. The alliance offers customers around the world the technological leadership required to effectively enhance reactor performance, power output and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/j2lL-7_yoVE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Research aims to enhance efficiency of wind turbines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A milestone in the history of renewable energy occurred in the year 2008 when more new wind-turbine power generation capacity was added in the United States than new coal-fired power generation. The costs of producing power with wind turbines continues to drop, but many engineers feel that the overall design of turbines is still far from optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New ideas for enhancing the efficiency of wind turbines were presented recently at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Long Beach, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One issue confronting the efficiency of wind energy is the wind itself &amp;ndash; specifically, its changeability. The aerodynamic performance of a wind turbine is best under steady wind flow, and the efficiency of the blades degrades when exposed to conditions such as wind gusts, turbulent flow, upstream turbine wakes and wind shear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now a new type of air-flow technology may soon increase the efficiency of large wind turbines under many different wind conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Syracuse University researchers Guannan Wang, Basman El Hadidi, Jakub Walczak, Mark Glauser and Hiroshi Higuchi are testing new intelligent-systems-based active flow control methods with support from the U.S. Department of Energy through the University of Minnesota Wind Energy Consortium. The approach estimates the flow conditions over the blade surfaces from surface measurements and then feeds this information to an intelligent controller to implement real-time actuation on the blades to control the airflow and increase the overall efficiency of the wind turbine system. The work may also reduce excessive noise and vibration due to flow separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initial simulation results suggest that flow control applied on the outboard side of the blade beyond the half radius could significantly enlarge the overall operational range of the wind turbine with the same rated power output or considerably increase the rated output power for the same level of operational range. The team also is investigating a characteristic airfoil in a new anechoic wind tunnel facility at Syracuse University to determine the airfoil lift and drag characteristics with appropriate flow control while exposed to large-scale flow unsteadiness. In addition, the effects of flow control on the noise spectrum of the wind turbine will be also assessed and measured in the anechoic chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another problem with wind energy is drag, the resistance felt by the turbine blades as they beat the air. Scientists at the University of Minnesota have been looking at the drag-reduction effect of placing tiny grooves on turbine blades. The grooves are in the form of triangular riblets scored into a coating on the blade surface. They are so shallow (between 40 and 225 microns) that they can&amp;rsquo;t be seen by the human eye, leaving the blades looking perfectly smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using wind-tunnel tests of 2.5-megawatt turbine airfoil surfaces (becoming one of the popular industry standards) and computer simulations, they are looking at the efficacies of various groove geometries and angles of attack (how the blades are positioned relative to the air stream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riblets like these have been used before, in the sails on sailboats taking part in the last America&amp;rsquo;s Cup regatta and on the Airbus airliner, where they produced a drag reduction of about 6 percent. The design of wind turbine blades was, at first, closely analogous to that of airplane wings. But owing to different engineering concerns, such as turbine blades having a much thicker cross-section close to the hub and wind turbines having to cope with peculiar turbulence near the ground, drag reduction won&amp;rsquo;t be quite the same for wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	University of Minnesota researchers Roger Arndt, Leonardo P. Chamorro and Fotis Sotiropoulos believe that riblets will increase wind turbine efficiency by about 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/O2AQucd3wEo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GM receives Energy and Environmental Excellence Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors received an Energy and Environmental Excellence Award from Hart Energy Publishing, recognizing the company&amp;rsquo;s progress toward the sustainable use of global natural resources and reducing its environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The award was presented Thursday at the &amp;ldquo;Meeting the Clean Fuels Challenge&amp;rdquo; conference in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We work hard to reduce our environmental impact throughout all of our business practices from sustainable facilities and greener vehicles to recycling and reusing materials,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Robinson, vice president of environment, energy and safety policy at GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When designing new vehicles, GM engineers use materials from renewable resources whenever economically and technically possible. Materials come from many sources, including old soft drink bottles, nylon carpet, used tires and recycled vehicle bumpers. For example, the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze&amp;rsquo;s sound insulation material is made from recycled blue jeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of their lifecycles, GM vehicles are at least 85 percent recyclable and 95 percent recoverable by weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy and Environmental Excellence Award comes on the heels of a recent &lt;a href="http://www.chevycarbonreduction.com/" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; by Chevrolet to invest $40 million in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The company also received industry accolades for its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle with extended range, including &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/bvRejH" target="_blank"&gt;Green Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt; by Green Car Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hart Energy Publishing provides specialized data/information products and member-only services to targeted audiences worldwide and ranks among the leading providers of news, data and analysis for the global energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/NwmoTE32fAA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

With enough interior space to accommodate five adults, Nissan LEAF features a driving range of 200 km (on JC08 mode), enough to satisfy the needs of most customers. Nissan LEAF also utilizes an advanced IT system, providing customers with convenient functional support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The price of Nissan LEAF starts from 3,764,250 yen, including the consumption tax. Since customers in Japan are eligible to receive up to 780,000 yen through government EV incentives for fiscal year 2010, the consumer&amp;#39;s net price for Nissan LEAF starts from 2,984,250 yen. Nissan LEAF also qualifies for preferential tax breaks under the Japanese &amp;quot;tax system to promote the diffusion of environmentally friendly vehicles&amp;quot; as next generation automobiles, thereby fully exempting it from the automobile acquisition tax and automobile weight tax until fiscal year 2011. Since it also qualifies for the &amp;quot;Automobile Green Tax Scheme,&amp;quot; the automobile tax is reduced by 50% for one year starting from the next fiscal year following registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help ensure comfortable, convenient and safe use of the new EV, Nissan offers a &amp;quot;Nissan zero-emission Support Program&amp;quot; for individual customers. The program which includes EV-IT communication charge, maintenance support such as regular inspections and the first car safety inspection, charging at Nissan dealers, discount service for Nissan Rentacar and emergency support in case of trouble - at the monthly rate of 1,500 yen. For corporate customers, Nissan provides &amp;quot;Nissan EV Fleet Maintenance Service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan dealers nationwide also provide &amp;quot;one-stop service&amp;quot; - from vehicle purchase to arranging for the preparation of a charging environment for detached houses. In addition, 200-volt normal charging is available at about 2,200 Nissan dealers nationwide. About 200 of these dealers are equipped with quick chargers that can charge the battery up to 80% of its full capacity in about 30 minutes. At least one quick-charge unit is available within a 40-kilometer radius throughout the country for the convenience of Nissan LEAF drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the goal of becoming a global leader in zero-emission mobility, Nissan, in conjunction with Renault, has signed more than 80 partnerships for zero-emission mobility with governments, municipalities and companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;
	Key features of the new Nissan LEAF are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Zero-emission&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unique driving experience&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 class="newsTitle"&gt;
	Overview of Nissan LEAF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An advanced EV powertrain that supports &amp;quot;zero-emission&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;The all-new Nissan LEAF is designed to provide &amp;quot;unique driving experience&amp;quot; with extraordinary acceleration performance, quietness and handling stability. Key powertrain components include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;High capacity lithium-ion battery (storage battery)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Vehicle performance, cost and interior comfort are greatly affected by the battery. Nissan LEAF adopts a lightweight, compact, high-capacity lithium-ion battery that achieves double the energy density compared to a conventional EV battery (such as used on the Nissan Hypermini, which was first released in February 2000). Delivering 24 kWh battery capacity and maximum power output of more than 90 kWh, a full charge provides a driving range of 200 km (on JC08 mode).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s advanced battery design utilizes a thin, compact laminated cell structure. The simple configuration of the individual cells, the smallest unit of the battery, allows a high battery capacity - along with very practical and flexible packaging without sacrificing interior comfort. Since the laminated cells have a large surface area and excellent cooling performance, stable performance is ensured in various usage environments. The structure also reduces cost through less parts complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Since manganese, which is used for positive electrode, is an abundant resource, with stable spinel structure, low cost and high reliability are ensured.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The battery pack is fitted below the floorboard at the center of the body, providing superior weight balance and a low center of gravity. In addition to enhancing body rigidity, this helps provide responsive handling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Electric motor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A three-phase AC synchronous motor delivering maximum power output of 80kW and maximum torque of 280Nã»m is used, which can instantly generate maximum torque from a starting position. With Nissan&amp;#39;s proprietary motor control technology, strong continuous acceleration with instantaneous force - which cannot be provided by a gasoline vehicle - is realized. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s acceleration performance in the low-to-medium speed range is equivalent to that of a 3.0-liter gasoline engine vehicle, and offers a maximum speed of 145km/h.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Unlike a gasoline engine, no vibrations are generated by the electric motor. This, along with and adoption of superior noise insulation technology, helps Nissan LEAF achieve extraordinary quiet operation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When the vehicle is decelerating, part of the braking energy is regenerated as electric power. This energy can be reused with this system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Inverter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The inverter controls power output from the motor by controlling the current, converting direct current into alternating current. Its components, including the power module, are originally developed by Nissan.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;DC/DC converter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Since electric components such as the audio system, headlights and the navigation system are operated at 12V voltage, the lithium-ion battery&amp;#39;s voltage of 360V for driving is reduced through a DC/DC converter for charging a 12V battery.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Special EV platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A spacious interior environment is provided by the new, specially designed EV platform and compact lithium-ion battery. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s cargo space capacity is 330L, which provides room for carrying two 9-inch golf bags without folding rear seats.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;span class="small02"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Capacity under the waist level (calculation based on the VDA method)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A flat, smooth floor configuration, unlike a gasoline vehicle, contributes to reduced air resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Vehicle body rigidity is improved through adopting a double frame structure and front joint configuration, helping provide stable ride comfort and direct, responsive handling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unique EV design, advanced features&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Along with its special EV platform and advanced drivetrain technology, Nissan LEAF offers uniquely designed EV exterior styling and an interior with advanced EV features and equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Exterior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Created around the principle of &amp;quot;smart fluidity,&amp;quot; Nissan LEAF offers smart styling with the ultimate level of flowing lines and aerodynamics.&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Replacing a gasoline engine with a compact motor allows the use of a simple front-end design without a radiator grille. Its flowing lines are linked to a large roof spoiler expressing dynamic movement in the rear.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The large vertically oriented LED headlights feature a sophisticated original design that is unique to the Nissan EV. The headlights protrude from the body and are positioned in a deep V-shape to help control airflow to the side mirrors and reduce drag and wind noise - a critical design consideration since wind noise is more noticeable in EVs with their quiet motor operation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A cross section of the roof antenna has a newly adopted shape, which helps reduce wind noise.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Excellent aerodynamics performance is realized through the use of thin, high-intensity LED rear combination lamps and a large diffuser with an aero fin mounted below the rear bumper - which features pronounced corners and no tailpipe.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A solar cell module is adopted to provide an auxiliary charge for the 12V battery used for the navigation system and other equipment. (Standard on G grade)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF is available in a choice of five exterior colors, including Aqua Blue (three-coat pearl metallic) - a new color inspired by the view of Earth as seen from space.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				An EV Iconic Blue is used as an accent color to evoke the image of Nissan LEAF in various components, including the headlight inner units and the emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Interior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s simple and elegant interior creates a light, clean and open EV image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The simple yet elegant interior space is equipped with features that provide great visibility, operability and a comfortable feel to the touch, helping provide outstanding comfort. The interior is offered in a light, refreshing color, Airy Grey.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The door trim combines synthetic leather and suede materials where it touches the body, providing a comfortable and soft feeling, while plated inside door handles express a luxury feel. The seat cloth is made of recycled plastic bottles and provides a suede-like texture and comfortable feel to the touch.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A flat-panel center cluster, designed like an advanced, smart digital device, has switches of the same shape, creating a sense of unity. With functions concentrated in the one area, user-friendly operation is realized.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				As with the Nissan LEAF exterior, an EV Iconic Blue is used as an interior accent color to intensify the image of EV in various parts, including a CI badge on the steering wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		Equipment&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Twin Digital Meter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF adopts an elegant twin digital meter layout, with a two-tier display focused on functionality and user-friendliness. An Eco Indicator, which gives the driver instant fuel economy readouts, and the speedometer are shown on the easier-to-read upper meter. ECO TREE&lt;span class="sup01"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shows cumulative results of eco driving. On the lower meter, a Power Meter displaying power output and regeneration of the lithium-ion battery and a Multi Information Display, which imparts charging and electricity efficiency information, battery remaining capacity, driving range and various warnings, are shown.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;span class="small02"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* ECO TREE is a trademark of Hino Motors, Ltd.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Electric Shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A new mouse-type electric shift can easily be operated just with a flick of the wrist by wrapping the palm around it. Nissan&amp;#39;s first by-wire system provides a light operational feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Start-up Sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When the power switch is on and the vehicle is ready to start, a pleasant tone (rather than a harsh engine sound) tells the driver that the vehicle is ready. The driver can easily switch between a choice of three different sounds. Along with the Twin Digital Meter, hospitality and a sophisticated EV feel is provided.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;&amp;quot;Approaching Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians&amp;quot; System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When driving at a low speed, the &amp;quot;Approaching Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians&amp;quot; system emits a sound to alert pedestrians that a vehicle is approaching.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Charging Method and Equipments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Charging ports are located in the front hood for &amp;quot;normal charge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;quick charge.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				It takes about 8 hours after the charge warning light is on to fully charge the battery for 200V normal charge. The battery can be charged up to 80% in about 30 minutes by quick charge.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A 7.5-meter charging cable for 200V normal charge is fitted as standard.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Safe charging is ensured by making a charging cable and charging ports waterproof and by installing drainage ports in the charging connecter and the charging ports. In case water enters and causes a short circuit, a control box that cuts electricity is installed in the charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Information function to be always &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; to EV&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;EV-IT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A global common ICT (Information and Communication Technology) system designed specifically for EV is adopted for application with Nissan LEAF. It not only provides on-board always-connected driving support on the car&amp;#39;s navigation display, but also supports EV driving even before the driver gets in the car and after getting out by accessing a dedicated Website for EV owners via mobile phones (including smart phones) or computers. This ICT system offers features unique to EV, including driving history and battery condition management, remote control for battery charging and climate control, and energy management for the coming renewable energy era. The NISSAN CARWINGS Data Center, an information control center, communicates with the car&amp;#39;s navigation system via the onboard Telematics Communication Unit (TCU). With the ICT system, Nissan LEAF owners are connected at all times to the data and information they need to optimize their EV experience.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Onboard EV service (while driving)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li class="normal"&gt;

&lt;ol class="comment"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		*1: Nissan LEAF qualifies for &amp;quot;Subsidies for measures designed to promote introduction of clean energy vehicles.&amp;quot; Subsidies are granted for the purchase by applying to the Next Generation Vehicle Promotion Center, which conducts examinations and decides to provide subsidies. Some local governments have their own subsidies. As for passenger vehicles for private use, those who receive the subsidies must continuously possess a vehicle for six years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		*2: Nissan LEAF qualifies for preferential tax breaks under the &amp;quot;tax system to promote the diffusion of environmentally friendly vehicles&amp;quot; as next generation automobiles, thus they are fully exempt from the automobile acquisition tax on vehicles newly registered by March 31, 2012, and the automobile weight tax on vehicles newly registered by April 30, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
		Meanwhile, the automobile tax on vehicles newly registered by March 31, 2012 is reduced by 50% for one year starting from the next fiscal year following the registrations.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>The top 10 signs that electric vehicles have gone mainstream</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Electric vehicles have stormed into the American consciousness with news like the release of the Chevy Volt and the development of &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-unveils-residential-wattstation-ev-charger/" jquery1291384497270="8"&gt;home chargers&lt;/a&gt; fueling the EV enthusiasm. But have EVs thoroughly penetrated mainstream culture? Here are the 10 clearest signs that EVs have officially hit the big-time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	10. Leo&amp;rsquo;s got one. So do Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. &lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2890118730_79672ff4e7.jpg?v=0" jquery1291384497270="9"&gt;Clooney&amp;rsquo;s even got 2 of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	9. Tokyo taxis are running on batteries that are switched out at stations in just 73 seconds (hard to believe? &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-better-place-to-partner-on-ev-infrastructure" jquery1291384497270="10"&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the video&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;a href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/bloomberg-powers-up-new-electric-car-charging-program/" jquery1291384497270="11"&gt;NYC is powered up&lt;/a&gt; and ready to drive (emissions-free, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	8. EVs are now the topic of pop songs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/top-10-signs-evs-have-gone-mainstream/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gereports%2Ffeed+%28GE+Reports%29"&gt;http://www.gereports.com/top-10-signs-evs-have-gone-mainstream/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gereports%2Ffeed+%28GE+Reports%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	3. On &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/gmchevyvolt" jquery1291384497270="16"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, more people &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; the Chevy Volt than &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2.

            <title>Grupo Bimbo begins construction on world's largest wind farm for food industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On December 2, Daniel Servitje, chief executive officer of Grupo Bimbo, accompanied by the Secretary of Energy, Dr. Georgina Kessel, senior managers of the Comision Federal de Electricidad (Federal Commission for Electric Power), and the Energy Regulation Commission and with the presence of Officials from the Government of the State of Oaxaca, announced the start of construction work at the Piedra Larga wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When completed, it will generate almost 100 percent of the electrical power consumed by Grupo Bimbo in Mexico. With an installed power of 90 megawatts, the farm will be able to supply the electric power consumed by 65 of the company&amp;#39;s facilities (production plants and other operation centers). Grupo Bimbo has also invited Grupo Calidra, Frialsa Frigorificos and Papalote Museo del Nino to participate in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The wind farm will be located in Union Hidalgo, State of Oaxaca. It was made possible thanks to the strategic alliance fostered by the Government of Mexico, the private sector and banks. The operation of the wind farm will be possible through the partnership of Grupo Bimbo with DEMEX (Mexican Wind Farm Developments), an affiliate of the Spanish company Renovalia Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grupo Bimbo has focused its attention on the implementation of wind energy to comply with the group&amp;#39;s permanent commitment to the environment and to the well-being of future generations. &amp;quot;The construction of this wind farm is the cornerstone in our effort to continue growing with nature&amp;#39;s force; making us the first company in the food industry to make this great change to use renewable energy sources,&amp;quot; said Servitje. &amp;quot;It represents an unprecedented effort in the use of renewable, clean and virtually endless energy: The green energy,&amp;quot; Servitje added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chairman of Renovalia Energy, Juan Domingo Ortega Martinez, said, &amp;quot;This construction constitutes a landmark in the expansion policy of renewable energies in Mexico. The total investment for wind project is approximately US$ 200 million. This wind farm will begin commercial operations for Grupo Bimbo at the end of 2011.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Georgina Kessel said, &amp;quot;There is no question that these types of actions contribute to reaching the goal of substituting clean energies. The challenge in Mexico is to make better use of this type of energy to strengthen the country&amp;#39;s power safety, and consolidating at the same time, active work to face climate change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Dr. Kessel, &amp;quot;These actions will allow the country to obtain a total of 35 percent of power generation with clean energies by 2024.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grupo Bimbo is constantly trying to reduce its environmental footprint, that is why it operates under the highest performance standards,&amp;quot; said Servitje. &amp;quot;This is an effort we have been carrying out for 10 years and is gaining more importance within our five axes of environmental sustainability: energy savings, water savings, emissions reduction, waste management and social entrepreneurial responsibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grupo Bimbo has had a role in the GEI Mexico Program since 2005. This year, for the fifth consecutive year, Grupo Bimbo has been acknowledged by SEMARNAT for declaring and publishing the GEI inventory of all its facilities and vehicles in Mexico and for the effort it has made to decrease its emissions,&amp;quot; said Luis Rene Martinez Souverville, Grupo Bimbo corporate affairs director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/8xoPAkjWZGY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dow secures renewable biomass energy source at Brazilian facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Dow Chemical Company on December 1 announced that its largest manufacturing facility in Brazil, the Aratu Complex, will add biomass to its portfolio of clean energy sources by the end of 2012. Upon project completion in December 2012, Aratu will be more than 75 percent sourced for power and steam through hydropower and eucalyptus cogeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eucalyptus wood biomass will be used to produce steam for the site&amp;rsquo;s chlor-alkali and chlorohydrin production processes. Dow has signed a supply agreement with Energias Renov&amp;aacute;veis do Brasil (ERB), which will invest, install and operate the biomass co-generation plant. The plant is expected to reduce the site&amp;rsquo;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 180,000 metric tons annually, and conserve 200,000 m3 of natural gas daily. The agreement will also enable carbon credits for Dow through the CO2 emission savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Dow, we&amp;rsquo;re focused on energy solutions that will unlock dramatic improvements in our energy profile as well as that of our customers and partners,&amp;rdquo; said Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow. &amp;ldquo;Our commitment to a sustainable energy future, like the Aratu project, will continue to drive unparalleled economic and societal benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Aratu site currently receives all of its electricity from hydropower, and will be the first petrochemical user of biomass in Brazil through the supply agreement. The steam produced by the co-generation plant will be integral to the manufacture of materials for the automotive, building and industrial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The new agreement at Aratu represents a significant milestone in our strategy to implement clean energy technology in our operations and advance our leadership in energy efficiency and carbon management,&amp;rdquo; said Doug May, vice president of energy and climate change at Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From 1994 to 2009, Dow has conserved over 1,700 trillion Btu of energy from its operations, which is the equivalent to the electrical energy used by all residential buildings in California for a full year. Dow&amp;rsquo;s energy efficiency efforts have also prevented more than 90 million metric tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Dow Chemical Company &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Dow connects chemistry and innovation with the principles of sustainability to help address many of the world&amp;rsquo;s most challenging problems such as the need for clean water, renewable energy generation and conservation, and increasing agricultural productivity. Dow&amp;rsquo;s diversified industry-leading portfolio of specialty chemical, advanced materials, agrosciences and plastics businesses delivers a broad range of technology-based products and solutions to customers in approximately 160&amp;nbsp;countries and in high growth sectors such as electronics, water, energy, coatings and agriculture. In 2009, Dow had annual sales of $45&amp;nbsp;billion and employed approximately 52,000&amp;nbsp;people worldwide. The company&amp;rsquo;s more than 5,000&amp;nbsp;products are manufactured at 214&amp;nbsp;sites in 37&amp;nbsp;countries across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/pwpN2U4YQbA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Survey: Only 7% of shoppers likely to consider electric car for next vehicle purchase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kelley Blue Book, &lt;a href="http://www.kbb.com/?scid=3099"&gt;www.kbb.com&lt;/a&gt;, the leading provider of new car and used car information, on November 30 reports the results of a recent Kelley Blue Book Market Intelligence study gauging consumer attitudes on electric vehicles. The latest results show that only 7 percent of car shoppers say they are likely to consider an electric vehicle for their next new-vehicle purchase or lease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the majority of survey respondents, the primary concerns about electric vehicles included the drivable range on a single charge (87 percent) and availability of charging stations (84 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most car shoppers (78 percent) said that if they were to purchase an electric vehicle, it would primarily be used as an everyday or commuter vehicle. In addition, on average, respondents said they would expect an electric vehicle to get 340 miles per charge in order for it to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Concerning value, nearly all car shoppers (91 percent) feel that electric vehicles are expensive, and 43 percent expect that electric vehicles will not retain their value as well as conventional gas cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less than half of respondents (45 percent) said they are interested in electric vehicle technology. For those interested in electric vehicle technology, the primary reason cited was reduction in reliance on foreign oil (85 percent), reduction in pollution (83 percent) and reduction in vehicle emissions (83 percent). Only 37 percent said they were interested in electric vehicle technology due to potential tax credits, and a mere 8 percent said they were interested because of potential access to carpool lane stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of those interested in electric vehicle technology, the majority (65 percent) said they were open to purchasing an electric vehicle from a company that has not previously sold vehicles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In gauging awareness of particular electric vehicle models, shoppers identified that they were most aware of the Chevrolet Volt at 71 percent, followed by the Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid at 68 percent. The Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid came in third for awareness at 46 percent, while the Nissan LEAF came in fourth at 45 percent. The Tesla Roadster came in fifth, with 39 percent awareness among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When shown pictures of electric vehicles that are currently or soon-to-be available for purchase/lease in the United States, the highest percentage of respondents (44 percent) said they would consider purchasing or definitely purchase the Chevrolet Volt, with the Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid coming in close second (43 percent), the Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid placing third (42 percent), the Ford Focus Electric reported in fourth (39 percent), and the Nissan LEAF finishing in fifth (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, according to recent new-car shopper activity on kbb.com, the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan LEAF are trending quite similarly. Since hitting kbb.com in August 2010, both vehicles have had triple digit month-over-month activity increases, with the Volt increasing 138 percent and the LEAF increasing 191 percent for September 2010. The latest activity levels for October 2010 indicate the Volt has a 178 percent month-over-month increase in new-car shopper activity on kbb.com, while the LEAF has a 167 percent month-over-month increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While it seems the car-shopping public still has a long way to go concerning electric vehicle consideration and understanding the realities of electric vehicle technology, the fact that there are all-new methods of propulsion becoming available to drivers is another great step forward for the automotive industry,&amp;quot; said James Bell, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com. &amp;quot;The Volt versus LEAF race continues to heat up, and there are many other players coming to market in the alternative energy space in the near future. Time will tell whether this technology will be readily adopted by a large number of mainstream car buyers, or if this will just be another flash in the pan of vehicle history.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This Kelley Blue Book Market Intelligence study gauging consumer attitudes on electric vehicles was fielded to 219 in-market car shoppers on Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com from October 10-25, 2010. Cited new-car shopper activity was based on month-over-month page view changes for the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan LEAF on Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com. Month-over-month changes were compared for August vs. September and September vs. October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/uTpXh9zoA9U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Nissan LEAF named 2011 European Car of the Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In a historic moment for Nissan Motor Company Ltd. and zero-emission vehicles, the 100 percent electric Nissan LEAF was awarded 2011 European Car of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The world&amp;#39;s first mass-marketed, affordable, zero-emission vehicle for the global market beat 40 contenders to win motoring&amp;#39;s most important accolade. This is the first time in the 47-year history of the annual competition that the award has gone to an electric vehicle. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s rivals included vehicles from brands such as Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Dacia, Ford, Opel/Vauxhall and Volvo. The jury included 57 leading motoring journalists from 23 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The jury acknowledged today that the Nissan LEAF is a breakthrough for electric cars. Nissan LEAF is the first EV that can match conventional cars in many respects,&amp;quot; said Hakan Matson, president of the jury, Car of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company president and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: &amp;quot;This award recognizes the pioneering zero-emission Nissan LEAF as competitive to conventional cars in terms of safety, performance, spaciousness and handling. It also reflects Nissan&amp;#39;s standing as an innovative and exciting brand with a clear vision of the future of transportation, which we call sustainable mobility. With three other electric vehicles in the pipeline from Nissan - and with the imminent market introduction of four additional electric vehicles from our Alliance partner Renault - Nissan LEAF represents a significant first step toward a zero-emission future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF is powered by a compact electric motor in the front of the car, which drives the front wheels. The AC motor develops 80 kilowatts of power and 280 Nm of torque, enough for a maximum speed of 145 kilometers per hour (90 mph). The electric motor is powered by a Nissan-developed laminated lithium-ion battery with an output of more than 90 kW. The car has a range of 175 km (New European Driving Cycle) between charges making it a practical proposition for many urban drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vehicle is fully equipped with features such as regenerating braking, air conditioning, satellite navigation, parking camera and advanced on-board IT and telematics systems. Innovative connectivity will allow an owner to set charging functions to monitor the car&amp;#39;s current state of charge and the remaining battery capacity, as well as to heat or cool the interior of the car remotely via mobile phone or computer. The Nissan LEAF will be available in five colors in Europe - blue metallic and pearl, white pearl, silver metallic, black solid and red pearl. The single option is a solar panel mounted in the rear spoiler that supports charging of the car&amp;#39;s 12-volt battery used for powering accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deliveries in Japan and the United States begin this December. In Europe, deliveries start in early 2011 to Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The zero-emission car is currently being built in Japan, but will also be produced in North America and Europe when new manufacturing facilities open in late 2012 and early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan&amp;#39;s innovative thinking extends beyond zero-emission mobility. Under the PURE DRIVE label, Nissan manufactures an extended line-up of environmentally friendly, internal combustion engine vehicles offering class-leading fuel efficiency supported by advanced green technologies. In Europe, the company will soon launch an advanced petrol-electric hybrid luxury sedan wearing the Infiniti badge, while hugely popular crossover vehicles, such as Nissan Qashqai and Nissan Juke, have created new and exciting vehicle segments dominated by Nissan. Next year will also see the arrival of the fourth generation Nissan Micra powered by a supercharged version of an all-new 1.2-litre three cylinder direct injection petrol engine with an Idling Stop system to offer spirited performance and CO2 emissions of just 95 grams per kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>PSEG applauds move to accelerate offshore wind development</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Scott Jennings, president of PSEG Global, issued the following statement regarding Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar on November 23 announcing an initiative to facilitate siting, leasing and construction of offshore wind projects off the Atlantic Coast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is welcome news, a promising step forward. Secretary Salazar should be commended for taking this initiative to reduce red tape and help create an environment that supports clean energy investments. Streamlining the leasing process by eliminating unnecessary steps is an important component in making offshore wind a commercially viable business. Today&amp;#39;s announcement &amp;nbsp;shows that the Interior Department recognizes that a more certain and expedited process can help unlock the potential of America&amp;#39;s offshore wind resources and that they are taking action to advance those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Developers continue to face many challenges to ensure that offshore wind meets the needs of various stakeholders &amp;ndash; environmental objectives, achieving economic development benefits through job creation and developing projects in a cost-effective manner for consumers. We continue to work within New Jersey&amp;#39;s balanced policy that establishes a net positive benefits test where economic development and other system benefits must outweigh the cost of the program. &amp;nbsp;A more certain and streamlined leasing and permitting timeline improves the prospects of meeting these objectives and launching this industry. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We look forward to working with the Interior Department and the State of New Jersey in the next step in this process when they issue a Request for Interest for New Jersey sites.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Programs help Harrison Steel improve energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When Harrison Steel Casting Company made the decision to advance its energy-efficiency efforts, the company took stock of the resources available to industry and made a strategic decision to partner with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;rsquo;s (EPA) Energy Star program and the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) Save Energy Now LEADER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel joined both of these programs because it allows the company to take advantage of the multitude of resources available from both Energy Star and the Save Energy Now LEADER programs. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s participation in both programs serves as an example that can be followed by other industrial companies interested in making improvements in energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Harrison Steel discovered, the programs differ in their scope and resources to provide complementary resources for industry. Where Energy Star focuses on assisting companies in establishing effective energy management teams and corporate energy management programs, Save Energy Now LEADER offers technical expertise and assistance for successfully implementing efficiency improvements to industrial systems and processes. Industrial companies that are interested in reducing energy consumption and the associated costs should examine the results that Harrison Steel has realized by partnering with both the Save Energy Now and Energy Star programs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/7fde0248-bbd8-45a3-bcf6-cd34938fc7cd_Harrison.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Ductile iron is poured into casting molds at the Harrison Steel facility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Harrison Steel energy manager Jeremy Allyn points to 2006 as the year that Harrison Steel began a clear commitment to energy reduction; that was the year when the company received an energy audit from Jack Staley of Balance Engineering. The audit produced a fairly extensive list of energy conservation measures. Although Harrison Steel did pursue some of the recommendations, the true value of that initial audit was opening the eyes of the company&amp;rsquo;s leaders and plant staff to the potential of realizing cost savings through the implementation of energy-efficiency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saving Energy to Improve the Bottom Line &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Energy costs at Harrison Steel typically constitute 5 to 8 percent of sales. In 2008, the company was operating at full capacity, and it spent approximately $5 million on electricity and $4 million on natural gas. However, it should be noted that Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s natural gas costs were slightly above average that year due to the higher-than-normal prices at the time. The company&amp;rsquo;s electricity prices in 2008 were 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) with approximately 73.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of usage that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008, the average operating profit for steel foundries with more than $25 million in annual sales, such as Harrison Steel, was 6.6 percent of sales. This slim profit margin is typical for steel foundries, and reducing operating costs through energy savings can help increase that margin and provide a competitive edge. Because rising energy costs can negatively affect profits, Harrison Steel understood that every dollar saved on energy spending would go directly to the bottom line. Additionally, the company understood that energy efficiency measures could have a more immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a company with a profit margin similar to Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s that cuts energy spending by $66,000 through efficiency measures like lighting or stopping air leaks would have to increase its total sales by $1 million to achieve the same financial impact. Also, an energy-efficiency project is a constant source of savings that a company can continue to experience year after year, while increasing sales volume on a constant basis is much more difficult. Harrison Steel understands these business-side benefits associated with capturing energy savings, in addition to the benefits that increased energy efficiency has for the environment. In fact, the company has even considered creating a different &amp;ndash; and higher &amp;ndash; internal rate of return (IRR) for energy projects since they include positive externalities and dependable, consistent savings. Nonetheless, even with using the same IRR as for other projects in the company, Harrison Steel has been able to identify and complete projects with high enough savings to justify implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initiating Energy Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The 2006 energy audit helped Harrison Steel to realize the potential savings that were available by upgrading equipment and improving production processes to increase efficiency. The company began to undertake projects with promising energy cost savings based on the audit recommendations. One such project involved an upgrade to the natural gas burners used for preheating ladles that hold molten metal. The burners were old and obsolete, using a less-than-optimal air and gas mixture and producing a poor flame shape. Harrison Steel chose to implement this project because of its capacity to reduce operating expenses while only costing approximately $17,500 to implement. The estimated energy savings from the improved burners is an impressive $73,857 per year, which means the repayment period for this project was less than three months. To achieve the same annual affect on the bottom line through increased sales, Harrison Steel would have had to generate an additional $1,119,045 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since that initial implementation, Harrison Steel has continued to make progress, including activities undertaken during the company&amp;rsquo;s 2009 Christmas shutdown. Allyn took advantage of the unusually quiet plant to perform his own assessment to locate air leaks. A single 1/16-inch diameter air leak in a compressed air system at 100 pounds per square inch (psi) loses air at 6.5 cubic feet per minute. At a $.06 per kWh rate, based on 24-hour-a-day operation, such leaks can result in added costs of $633 per year. Equipped with nothing but the naked ear, Allyn was able to locate around 100 air leaks. Harrison Steel uses approximately 5,000 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) of compressed air &amp;ndash; or 2.6 billion standard cubic feet (SCF) annually &amp;ndash; with the largest end-use being the pneumatic transportation of sand for making molds. Fixing those air leaks identified by Allyn was believed to have produced approximately $15,000 in annual energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another project identified in the 2006 energy audit that Harrison Steel is currently implementing is a variable speed drives project for its well pumps. This upgrade will allow the company to actually slow down the pumps to control the plant&amp;rsquo;s water pressure rather than using demand valves to throttle the pressure while the machine is running at full speed. This variable speed drives upgrade will cost $25,000 to implement and will save the company approximately $16,800 per year in electricity costs &amp;ndash; a payback period of less than 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the fall of 2009, Harrison Steel began its partnership with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star for Industry program, a voluntary government partnership program aimed at helping companies develop and improve energy management programs. Harrison Steel became aware of Energy Star through its work in the Energy Star Focus on Energy Efficiency in the metalcasting industry. The Energy Star program offers guidance to its partners focused on strengthening energy management and establishing corporate energy programs and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In making the decision to partner with EPA, Harrison Steel was particularly attracted to the idea of associating the company with the popular Energy Star brand, a national symbol of energy efficiency and environmental protection. Harrison Steel saw joining the Energy Star program as a way of building a sustainable energy management framework for its energy efforts, making them more personal to employees, not just a list of engineering items to complete. The program also provided Harrison Steel access to a network of companies undertaking similar efforts. Under the program, a Strategic Energy Advisor (SEA) was assigned to Harrison Steel; that SEA is now working with the company to help it build an Energy Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, Harrison Steel has experienced two main benefits from partnering with Energy Star. First, the company has been able to interact one-on-one with its SEA in order to learn from the experiences of other companies in establishing an Energy Team. Second, the company has gained valuable insights from Web conferences that offer the opportunity to network with and learn from other professionals involved in energy management at organizations with similar goals and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to Energy Star&amp;rsquo;s partnership for industry, Harrison Steel also values Energy Star as a resource for improving building envelope systems. Energy Star has resources for energy management in buildings such as office and warehouse facilities. For example, the 2006 energy audit had a recommendation for Harrison Steel to upgrade lighting within certain storage and office buildings. Although Harrison Steel had this report for years, it was unable to implement the recommendation until Energy Star assisted in the formation of the Harrison Steel Energy Team. This team has been able to focus on moving ahead with such projects, and Harrison Steel has now approved a lighting project costing around $10,000 for one of the company&amp;rsquo;s storage facilities. This project will install more efficient lighting in the storage facility, as well as use motion sensor lighting controls, which will compound the cost savings by automatically turning off lights when no one is in certain parts of the building. The lighting upgrade is expected to save the company between $2,500 and $4,500 per year in electricity costs, the equivalent of increasing annual sales by $38,000 to $68,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to partnering with the EPA, Harrison Steel decided in the spring of 2010 to partner with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER initiative. The company quickly recognized the added value that Save Energy Now offered. Once the company began looking at the Save Energy Now resources online, it realized that ITP offers technical expertise and engineering applied to industrial energy. Harrison Steel appreciated Save Energy Now&amp;rsquo;s technical tools that could be applied to the company&amp;rsquo;s systems. This DOE expertise compliments the work the company had begun with Energy Star. Harrison Steel decided it should also join the Save Energy Now LEADER initiative after recognizing ITP&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise in industrial systems, which are in-depth and detail-specific to industrial processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel immediately benefitted from Save Energy Now through the use of the initiative Web site materials like information on improving energy efficiency through upgrading existing standard belts to newer V-belts for belt-driven equipment, such as fans. Standard belts are approximately 95 percent efficient in transferring mechanical energy, but the V-belts improve efficiency by an additional 2 percent since they require less energy to bend and do not slip. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s energy team also utilized ITP&amp;rsquo;s online materials to gain insight and instruction that may allow the company to implement a new project dealing with combustion efficiency of heat treatment furnaces. This project would focus on controlling the oxygen level, making sure there is not too much air in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example for Other Industrial Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The complementary nature of the resources provided by the Energy Star and Save Energy Now initiatives is an important take-away concept for other industrial companies interested in advancing energy management programs. As Allyn noted, where Energy Star for Industry shines in terms of its energy management resources, including energy team support and motivating brand, Save Energy Now brings the engineering tools needed to achieve implementation. Companies partnering with both programs will find themselves equipped with the full spectrum of tools needed to plan and achieve energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hasbro sets new environmental sustainability goals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Hasbro Inc. announced November 22 that it will be taking a wide range of steps in the coming years to build upon its successes in the areas of corporate responsibility and environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in 2011, the company will eliminate all wire ties from its packaging. In addition, for 2011 the company has set a goal that at least 75 percent of its paper packaging will be derived from recycled material or sources that practice sustainable forest management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By 2015, Hasbro has set a goal of 90 percent usage of these materials and sources for all of its paperboard packaging and in-box game content. Hasbro is also working with its core toy and game licensees to help them put similar standards in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To further support and ensure the success of the company&amp;rsquo;s efforts in sustainability, Hasbro will be hiring a director of product and packaging sustainability, reporting directly into the global chief development officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Walmart applauds Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s industry leadership position in the area of environmental sustainability, which includes its initiative to systematically reduce, and eventually replace, wire ties with sustainable and innovative materials made from paper rattan and other materials,&amp;rdquo; said Laura Phillips, Walmart&amp;rsquo;s senior vice president of toys and seasonal merchandising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s commitment to sustainability has been, and continues to be a high priority in virtually all facets of our operations,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Goldner, Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s president and CEO. &amp;ldquo;The company&amp;rsquo;s ongoing focus on sustainability is critically important to Hasbro and to the consumers around the world who enjoy our brands and products. Importantly, we will be taking additional steps in the area of sustainability going forward, building upon what we have already accomplished in recent years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advances in sustainability announced by Hasbro reflect its leadership position and an ongoing corporate responsibility commitment, with a specific focus on making improvements that will promote sustainable sourcing of materials. In 2010, Hasbro significantly reduced plastic bags from its product instructions, removing some 800,000 pounds of material worldwide from the waste stream. Currently, more than 90 percent of solid waste generated at the company&amp;rsquo;s owned and operated manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts and Ireland is recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Hasbro Inc. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Hasbro is a branded play company providing children and families around the world with a wide-range of immersive entertainment offerings based on the company&amp;rsquo;s world class brand portfolio. From toys and games, to television programming, motion pictures, video games and a comprehensive licensing program, Hasbro strives to delight its customers through the strategic leveraging of well-known and beloved brands such as TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, PLAYSKOOL, MY LITTLE PONY, G.I.

            <title>Researchers look to convert tidal energy into electricity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Interest in developing alternative energy sources is driving the consideration of a promising technology that uses underwater turbines to convert ocean tidal flow energy into electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now lessons learned from the ocean&amp;#39;s largest mammals has inspired United States Naval Academy researchers to tackle one of the serious challenges of this technology: the low velocity associated with many tidal flows and the difficulty of extracting useful energy from low speed flows using current designs. They will present their findings November 22 at the American Physical Society&amp;rsquo;s Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) meeting in Long Beach, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We designed a novel blade modification for potential turbine performance improvement, which was inspired by humpback whale flippers, with the addition of tubercles, or bumps, to the leading edge of each blade,&amp;rdquo; explains Mark Murray, a Naval Academy engineering professor. Previous research demonstrated the addition of biomimetically derived protuberances (technology that mimics nature) improved stall characteristics and aerodynamic performance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The researchers&amp;rsquo; modified blades proved to be more effective in extracting energy at low speeds. Importantly, the blades did not degrade performance at high flow speeds or increase the mechanical complexity of the turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applications of this research may include the development of turbine designs that are more effective in converting low velocity tidal flow energy into useful electricity and more economically feasible to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This project was conducted as an undergraduate independent research study by Ensign Timothy Gruber, who is currently attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology&amp;rsquo;s masters program, with Murray and associate professor David Fredriksson in the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department acting as his faculty advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/wEk5CQ9w_Fs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>With commercialization of electric cars, planes are close behind</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Now that &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/in-largest-single-commitment-ge-to-buy-25000-electric-vehicles/" jquery1290456817274="8"&gt;electric cars have hit the mainstream&lt;/a&gt;, it raises the question, what about other forms of transportation running on electricity? Specifically, will we ever see electric planes flying over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Believe it or not, they&amp;rsquo;re already here. The battery-powered &lt;a href="http://yuneeccouk.site.securepod.com/Aircraft.html" jquery1290456817274="9"&gt;Yuneec E430&lt;/a&gt; two-seater is currently in production (you can fly away with one for less than a hundred grand). And the &lt;a href="http://www.lange-aviation.com/htm/english/products/antares_20e/antares_20E.html" jquery1290456817274="10"&gt;Antares 20E sailplane&lt;/a&gt; has electric propulsion that can take it to 10,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/electric-flight1.jpg" /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Ready to go:&lt;/span&gt; The Yuneec E430 above was turning heads at this &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/oshkosh-part-2-flying-smart-grids-a-salute-to-vets/" jquery1290456817274="11"&gt;summer&amp;rsquo;s Oshkosh Air Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what about commercial flight? You know, the big Trans-Atlantic planes, with flight attendants and snacks? Not only would electric planes make zero-emission flight a reality, but they could fly much more quietly than conventional jets &amp;mdash; which would be more pleasant for passengers, and could ultimately bring airports closer to city centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even these are a definite possibility: Pranav Patel, Chief Marketing Officer at GE Aviation Systems, says electric planes the size of 737s could be flying commercial routes by 2040 or 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the electric evolution is already underway for conventional planes. &amp;ldquo;If you look at new jets such as &lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/" jquery1290456817274="12"&gt;Boeing&amp;rsquo;s Dreamliner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.jsf.mil/" jquery1290456817274="13"&gt;Joint Strike Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, large portions of their systems are [already] electrified,&amp;rdquo; Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next generation of commercial jets will have &amp;ldquo;more dynamic power management, allowing essentially a &amp;lsquo;SmartGrid on Aircraft,&amp;rsquo; with open rotor types of high-efficiency jet engines,&amp;rdquo; according to Patel. The eventual goal is &amp;ldquo;electric propulsion zero-emission aircraft,&amp;rdquo; which will have an &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-and-nasa-to-test-open-rotor-jet-engine-systems/" jquery1290456817274="14"&gt;open-structure propulsion&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; so &amp;ldquo;when the plane becomes all electric, the motor will still have a propeller-type open-fan structure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So just how fast will these electric planes fly? As fast &amp;mdash; or faster &amp;mdash; than today&amp;rsquo;s conventional jets. &amp;ldquo;[Electric planes would be] no different than cars today,&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;Take the electric car and look at the torque and speed it gives you. It&amp;rsquo;s actually more torque than you get with a regular [gas-powered] engine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the Chevy Volt is fully comparable to a 747. &amp;ldquo;The biggest difference between electric cars and electric planes is you need a significantly higher energy density storage system [for planes],&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;Weight is very important, because with planes you&amp;rsquo;re talking about the lift, as well as the range.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In pursuit of that high density power, engineers who will soon be located at &lt;a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/EPISCENTER_Nov_2010.pdf" jquery1290456817274="15"&gt;Electrical Power Integrated Systems&lt;/a&gt; (EPISCENTER), GE&amp;rsquo;s new electrical-power R&amp;amp;D center in Dayton, Ohio, are working on aircraft systems that will use solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power, with lithium batteries as intermediate storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here is &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/new-electric-flight-rd-center-to-bring-jobs-to-ohio/" jquery1290456817274="16"&gt;EPISCENTER&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; road map to electric commercial flight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Shrink the on-board components of the plane to roughly one-third of their current weight and volume, (via advances in high power semiconductor devices ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Migrate flight control systems away from hydraulic and into electro-mechanical, in order to integrate with electric propulsion systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Finalize SOFC fuel cell development. Batteries alone don&amp;rsquo;t have the power density required for long flights &amp;mdash; but will remain an important link in the power chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Optimize high-speed superconducting motors to make the most efficient use of precious on-board power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So will there someday be 747&amp;rsquo;s that run like the Chevy Volt? &amp;ldquo;Sure,&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all about energy-optimized aircraft. Some say 50 or 60 years down the road is aggressive, some say maybe not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And oh by the way, how about helicopters? &amp;ldquo;The short answer is Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota outlines eco-car plans, battery research progress</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announced details of its plans for &amp;quot;eco-car&amp;quot; development and launches and of progress in next-generation secondary-battery research &amp;mdash; both part of environmental technology efforts aimed at limiting oil consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions through the use of electricity and other alternative energies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="bnormal"&gt;Details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1. Hybrid Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC plans to introduce 11 models by the end of 2012, consisting of all-new models and redesigned models. Of the planned new models, one is a compact with fuel efficiency in excess of 40 km/L under the 10-15 Japanese test cycle.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	By early 2012, TMC plans to begin sales of a &amp;quot;Prius&amp;quot;-based PHV, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe. Sales are targeted at more than 50,000 units annually, and the price for Japan is expected to be in the 3-million-yen range.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Electric Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	In 2012, in addition to the U.S. market, an iQ-based EV will also be introduced in Japan and Europe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Launch preparations call for road trials in Japan, U.S., and Europe starting in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Launch in China is also being considered, with road trials planned for 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Separately, the &amp;quot;RAV4 EV&amp;quot; concept, which was developed jointly with Tesla Motors, will be on display until November 28 at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, United States.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	4. Fuel Cell Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is continuing development of a sedan-type fuel-cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV), with sales aimed to start in around 2015 in Japan, the U.S. and Europe &amp;mdash; markets in which hydrogen supply infrastructure is expected to develop. Although currently a price under 10 million yen seems attainable, TMC aims to further reduce costs to bring the vehicle to market at a more-affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	5. Next-generation Secondary Batteries&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is researching development of next-generation secondary batteries with performance that greatly exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries. Such research is aimed to help bring about the revolutionary advances in battery performance that will be necessary for the broad adoption of electric-motor-propelled eco-cars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solid-state batteries: TMC has successfully reduced what is known as particle resistance and has made progress toward creating full solid-state batteries in a promising compact package.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metal-air batteries: TMC has determined the reaction mechanism of lithium-air batteries and has clarified its research policy regarding the batteries as rechargeable secondary batteries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;In January 2010, TMC established a division charged with studying production of next-generation batteries. &amp;nbsp;The division, with a staff of approximately 100 researchers, is accelerating its research.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC believes that eco-cars can have a positive impact on the environment only if they are widely used.&amp;nbsp;TMC will continue to improve the fuel efficiency of its conventional combustion-engine cars, which account for the majority of its sales, while raising performance, reducing costs and expanding the company&amp;#39;s product lineup. Within these efforts, hybrid technologies &amp;mdash; consisting of the basic technologies necessary for development of various eco-cars &amp;mdash; are positioned as key technologies to achieve both high fuel efficiency and driving performance, and to facilitate the use of various fuels with the aim of creating a low-carbon society through response to the need to diversify energy sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/WzuLMaHEDYI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chevrolet invests in clean energy projects across America</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Chevrolet announced last week that it will invest $40 million in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The initiative is based on projects that promote energy savings, renewable energy, responsible use of natural resources and conservation in communities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, 8 million metric tons equals the CO2 emissions of one year of electricity use in 970,874 homes or the annual carbon reduction from 1.7 million acres of pine forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chevrolet&amp;rsquo;s clean energy investments to be implemented in the next three to five years may include projects such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Providing energy efficient technology such as smart energy sensors and solar panels to schools and other community-based facilities in need of upgrades to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and reduce heating bills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supporting wind farms and solar projects that deliver renewable energy to the grid and also help family farms increase their revenues per acre.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Capturing flammable methane from community landfills that delivers clean energy to the grid and improves local air quality and safety.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Contributing to forestry projects throughout America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GM has made great progress in reducing our environmental impact, but we know we can do more,&amp;rdquo; said General Motors CEO Dan Akerson. &amp;ldquo;Chevrolet&amp;rsquo;s investment is an extension of the environmental initiatives we&amp;rsquo;ve been undertaking for years because the solution to global environmental challenges goes beyond just vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is an opportunity to connect with Chevy customers through clean energy projects that directly impact them,&amp;rdquo; Akerson said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM estimates its new carbon-reduction goal equates to the emissions in 2011 from driving the 1.9 million vehicles Chevrolet is expected to sell in the United States over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy is an iconic emblem of America and it is a big deal that it is stepping forward to address one of our greatest challenges &amp;ndash; moving us toward a low-carbon future,&amp;rdquo; said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. &amp;ldquo;Chevy is clearly demonstrating that companies can act now and help propel clean energy solutions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1990, GM has decreased its manufacturing emissions by 60 percent. GM also has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build fuel-efficient vehicles like the Chevrolet Cruze Eco, which gets an EPA-estimated 42 mpg on the highway, and the Chevy Volt electric car with extended-range capability. The Volt allows 25-50 miles of pure electric driving on a single charge after which a small gasoline engine/generator creates electricity for an additional 300 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy&amp;rsquo;s Volt and its clean energy investment both exemplify the bold leadership businesses can take today to address our changing climate,&amp;rdquo; Claussen said.&amp;rdquo; Its commitment to community-focused clean energy and energy efficiency investments will drive change and increase awareness across the country.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other GM initiatives include reducing water use by nearly 35 percent between 2005 and 2009 at manufacturing facilities worldwide; decreasing fossil fuel at GM plants by using landfill gas, hydro and solar power; recycling 90 percent of the waste the company generates; and operating 75 landfill-free facilities, more than half of its manufacturing plants globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chevy will be making investments through third-party organizations such as Bonneville Environmental Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Portland, Ore. To define project criteria and the program&amp;rsquo;s investment portfolio, GM has engaged environmental experts, non-government organizations and academics through the Climate Neutral Business Network. Advisors include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bob Sheppard, vice president of corporate programs at Clean Air-Cool Planet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Derik Broekhoff, vice president of policy at Climate Action Reserve&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mark Kenber, deputy CEO at The Climate Group&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Snehall Desai, Sustainability Marketer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Janet Peace, vice president at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eban Goodstein, director of the Center for Environmental Policy, Bard College&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy understands that to lead in the environmental arena it needs to collaborate with experts from outside its industry,&amp;rdquo; said Goodstein. &amp;ldquo;Their engagement of NGOs and academia in development of the scope and strategy of this initiative shows their commitment to projects that will make the most impact across America&amp;rsquo;s communities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Verso Paper launches renewable energy project at Maine mill</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Verso Paper Corporation announced November 19 the launch of a $40 million Renewable Energy Project at its Bucksport, Maine, mill. This project will provide a 43 percent increase in thermal energy production from renewable biomass at the Bucksport Mill and will generate additional green power &amp;ndash; equivalent to the amount needed to supply electricity to 30,000 Maine households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This project represents what Verso stands for when it comes to our position as a green energy company and as a leader in environmental stewardship. We will have the ability to generate more green energy from renewable biomass, which reduces our carbon footprint, all while increasing overall energy efficiency,&amp;rdquo; says Verso president and chief executive officer Mike Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bucksport Mill will achieve these energy efficiency improvements by replacing coal with biomass in the #8 Boiler and installing a new 25-megawatt turbine generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partnering with people and organizations at the local, federal and state levels is a key element in making this project a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The forest products industry needs to change, and Verso is at the forefront of innovative practices such as improving energy efficiency by pursuing biofuel opportunities. Doing so also has the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing overall energy consumption in Maine. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working aggressively to expand renewable power generation and have been recognized nationally for our efforts to promote energy efficiency. Partnering with private industry like Verso is essential for us to meet our goals,&amp;rdquo; says Maine Governor John Baldacci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Funding for the Bucksport Renewable Energy Project includes a grant from Efficiency Maine. Efficiency Maine is an independent trust that invests in cost-effective energy efficiency or alternative energy projects to reduce energy costs and improve Maine&amp;rsquo;s business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This project illustrates Verso&amp;rsquo;s commitment to Maine and its surrounding community. Such an investment shows the company&amp;rsquo;s strong belief in this area, and also demonstrates its ability to adapt as a manufacturing business, thus keeping jobs at the mill. This project is another step in innovation that is helping to make Bucksport competitive in a tough global economy,&amp;rdquo; says Bucksport Town Manager Roger Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Verso is committed to continuing energy-saving efforts in Maine and company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob Gemmer, technology manager with the Department of Energy Office of Industrial Technologies, says, &amp;ldquo;Verso is a great example of our industry partnership, the &lt;em&gt;Save Energy Now &lt;/em&gt;LEADER program. The company is fully committed to reducing energy intensity by 25 percent in 10 years and producing green power in a sustainable way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bucksport Renewable Energy Project is scheduled to begin construction before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Verso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Memphis, Tenn., Verso Paper Corporation is a leading North American producer of coated papers, including coated groundwood and coated freesheet, and supercalendered and specialty products.

            <title>Just how loud is a wind turbine?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Because wind turbines are such a great source of clean, renewable energy, they&amp;rsquo;re usually &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/wind-expo-3000-blade-signatures-a-great-lakes-1st/" jquery1290182903921="8"&gt;greeted with a great deal of enthusiasm&lt;/a&gt;. But some complaints have been made that they can cause &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/energy-environment/06noise.html " jquery1290182903921="9"&gt;too much noise for residents&lt;/a&gt; living within a mile of the blades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So just how noisy are these turbines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The closest that a wind turbine is typically placed to a home is 300 meters or more. At that distance, a turbine will have a sound pressure level of 43 decibels. To put that in context, the average air conditioner can reach 50 decibels of noise, and most refrigerators run at around 40 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At 500 meters (0.3 miles) away, that sound pressure level drops to 38 decibels. In most places, according to Keith Longtin of &lt;a href="http://ge.geglobalresearch.com/" jquery1290182903921="10"&gt;GE Global Research&lt;/a&gt;, background noise ranges from 40 to 45 decibels, meaning that a turbine&amp;rsquo;s noise would be lost amongst it. For the stillest, most rural areas, Longtin says the background noise is 30 decibels. At that level, a turbine located about a mile away wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. Foodservice deploys Orion Energy Systems LED technology at multiple sites</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font size="2"&gt;Orion Energy Systems Inc. on November 18 announced that U.S. Foodservice will deploy Orion&amp;#39;s LED technology and intelligent occupancy sensors in freezers at five of its facilities, including Little Rock, Ark.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Boca Raton, Fla.; Norwich, Conn.; and Zebulon, N.C.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As part of U.S. Foodservice&amp;#39;s commitment to sustainable business practices, the company is completing a major lighting retrofit project that includes the installation of Orion&amp;#39;s new LED lighting platform.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Designed for freezer applications and launched in June of this year, Orion&amp;#39;s I-Frame configuration, reflector design, and adjustable optical lens have proven to provide superior performance in field tests, including a test at U.S. Foodservice&amp;#39;s Norwich facility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In a freezer application, Orion&amp;#39;s LED technology turns from completely off to full brightness instantly compared to traditional High Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting which can take up to 20 minutes. Because of the LED lamp&amp;#39;s ability to operate at extremely low temperatures, the fixture doesn&amp;#39;t require an enclosure which results in more efficient light output in addition to making it lightweight and easy to install, saving money on installation and maintenance costs. In a freezer application, the life of Orion&amp;#39;s LED fixture will exceed 100,000 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;In addition to the substantial energy savings and 30 percent increase in light levels, the instant on/off feature of Orion&amp;#39;s LED technology was attractive to us,&amp;quot;said Michael Frank, vice president of operational excellence. &amp;quot;The on/off feature also allows us to easily integrate Orion&amp;#39;s InteLite wireless dynamic occupancy sensors into the system, which increases the savings significantly.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	U.S. Foodservice will replace 400-watt High Intensity Discharge (HID) fixtures with 150-watt Orion LED fixtures. The actual number of new fixtures installed will be 15 percent less than what is currently installed. The dramatic reduction in watts consumed, coupled with the InteLite control system, is expected to decrease the amount of electricity the food-service distributor uses in its freezers by 1.5 million kilowatt-hours a year, while at the same time increase light levels by 30 percent.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The LED platform is the newest addition to Orion&amp;#39;s suite of products and technology that delivers energy savings without compromise. All products are designed to save customers money, while reducing electric load on the grid.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	U.S. Foodservice began deploying Orion technology in 2009. To date, the company is reducing its energy consumption for lighting by 30 million kilowatt-hours and saving $3.3 million per year. As a result, U.S. Foodservice will reduce 19,076 tons of greenhouse gasses annually including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury, which are all byproducts of electricity generation. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the electricity reduction is the air scrubbing equivalent of a 5,390-acre forest or like saving 4.5 million gallons of gasoline a year.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Orion has deployed its energy management systems in 6,128 facilities across North America, including 126 of the Fortune 500 companies. Since 2001, Orion technology has displaced more than 574 megawatts, saving customers more than $1 billion and reducing indirect carbon dioxide emissions by over 8 million tons.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Orion Energy Systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Orion Energy Systems Inc. is a leading power technology enterprise that designs, manufactures and deploys energy management systems, consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient lighting platforms, intelligent wireless control systems and direct renewable solar technology for commercial and industrial customers without compromising their operations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/B3jALWpDIUs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE, partners name five winners of 'ecomagination Challenge'</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE unveiled on November 16 the five innovation award winners of its $200 million open innovation challenge, the &amp;ldquo;GE ecomagination Challenge: Powering the Grid.&amp;rdquo; The Challenge, launched in July, is part of GE&amp;rsquo;s ecomagination commitment to accelerate development of the next generation power grid and global energy transformation through open collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The five innovation award winners submitted ideas that could contribute to creating a smarter, cleaner, more efficient electric grid and represent the entrepreneurial spirit of the Challenge, They were selected by an independent panel of judges including challenge advisor, Wired magazine editor Chris Anderson, GE executives and leading academics and technologists. Videos of the winners are available at &lt;a _extended="true" class="bhv_external" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecomagination.com%2Fannouncements&amp;amp;esheet=6513823&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.ecomagination.com%2Fannouncements&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=32d22f14166567b9fc60315b33c32269"&gt;www.ecomagination.com/announcements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The winning ideas are a lightweight inflatable wind turbine; a technology that instantly de-ices wind turbine blades so they never slow or shut down; an intelligent water meter that can generate its own power; a cyber-secure network infrastructure that allows two-way communications grid monitoring and substation automation from wind and solar farms; and a technology solves short-circuiting and outages from overloaded electric grids by enabling precise control over their flow and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Challenge generated nearly 4,000 ideas and facilitated robust conversations across the open innovation platform between 70,000 entrepreneurs in more than 150 countries over a 10-week period. GE partnered with four leading venture capital firms, Emerald Technology Ventures, Foundation Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byer and RockPort Capital, to conceive and implement the Challenge, calling for innovation ideas in three categories: Renewables, Grid and Eco Homes/Eco Buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We launched the Challenge to encourage new thinking and spur innovation at every level of development,&amp;rdquo; said Beth Comstock, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, GE. &amp;ldquo;The first step toward modernizing our grid is to uncover ideas and transform them into game-changing technologies and the Challenge has demonstrated that many great ideas exist out there. The smart thinking and compelling business cases presented make these innovation award winning ideas examples of pioneering entrepreneurship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The five innovation Challenge award winners will each receive $100,000 to develop their ideas. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE explains why fleets are ideal for early EV adoption</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How close are we to a tipping point for large-scale electric vehicle adoption? Following GE&amp;rsquo;s move last week &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/in-largest-single-commitment-ge-to-buy-25000-electric-vehicles/" jquery1289920066906="8"&gt;to buy 25,000 electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; for its own fleet and its fleet customers, on November 16 the non-profit Electrification Coalition released its detailed, 80-page analysis, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://electrificationcoalition.org/reports/EC-Fleet-Roadmap-screen.pdf" jquery1289920066906="9"&gt;Fleet Electrification Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It spells out the advantages, challenges, and policies necessary to spur electric drive technology in commercial and government vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report underscores that the nation&amp;rsquo;s fleet vehicles stand out as &amp;ldquo;possessing unique characteristics&amp;rdquo; that could make them clear beneficiaries of EV technology. Those attributes can accelerate early adoption, which in turn will help drive down EV costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, one of the biggest items in favor of fleets is that they drive predictable routes every day. That means &amp;ldquo;range anxiety&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; the worry that your battery charge will run out on a longer trip &amp;mdash; is less of an issue for large commercial customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the coalition report points out, most consumer vehicles travel less than 30 miles per day, but automakers are gearing up to produce EVs with bigger batteries to address range anxiety. &amp;ldquo;Providing 100 miles of range could add as much as $14,400 to the cost of a vehicle for the battery alone &amp;mdash; 33 percent of the total vehicle cost,&amp;rdquo; they note. On the other hand, fleet customers can cut EV costs by not having, or needing, extended range batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://electrificationcoalition.org/reports/EC-Fleet-Roadmap-screen.pdf#page=31&amp;amp;zoom=125,0,620" jquery1289920066906="10"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/daily-miles-sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Now and then:&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ldquo;In essence, today&amp;rsquo;s EVs and PHEVs are being designed to provide for consumers&amp;rsquo; longest expected trips, even if those trips rarely occur.&amp;rdquo; Click the chart to see a larger view on the report itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other factors also make EVs great cost-cutters for fleets. Because fleets use their vehicles so frequently (more than a regular consumer), they can recoup their upfront costs earlier. When it comes to charging, they usually have their own depots, which brings down the cost of initial investment in charging infrastructure. And EVs are also expected to bring down maintenance costs vs. traditional gasoline engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://electrificationcoalition.org/reports/EC-Fleet-Roadmap-screen.pdf#page=28&amp;amp;zoom=100,0,400" jquery1289920066906="11"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sectors-chart1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Big Dent:&lt;/span&gt; The report points out that the fleet opportunities in the U.S. are immense, with more than 16 million public and private fleet vehicles on the road. While fleet sizes vary, the top 50 fleet operators together manage more than half a million cars and trucks. That concentrated buying power offers &amp;ldquo;a significant opportunity to assist the early development of the electric drive vehicle industry,&amp;rdquo; the report notes. Click to enlarge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fleet adoption also creates an unknown &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; factor when it comes to EV technology. As David Crane, president and CEO of NRG Energy, said at the coalition&amp;rsquo;s panel discussion in Washington, D.C. this morning, widespread adoption of EVs will spur unintended technological advances &amp;mdash; and radically change daily habits. EVs aren&amp;rsquo;t just cars, he said, &amp;ldquo;they are a disruptive technology.&amp;rdquo; He compared them to smart phones, which started out as simply better communication devices but soon became interwoven into the fabric of our daily lives &amp;mdash; in ways we never expected at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda suppliers earn environmental achievement awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As part of its global initiative to reduce the impact of manufacturing on the environment, Honda presented its prestigious Green Factory Environmental Achievement Award to eight parts suppliers in North America that have excelled at conserving natural resources, reducing energy use and eliminating waste to landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda presented the awards during its 18th annual Environmental, Safety and Ergonomics Symposium held November 10-11 at Honda of America Manufacturing Inc.&amp;#39;s campus near Marysville, Ohio. In addition to recognizing top environmental achievements, the suppliers attended seminars and roundtable sessions on environmental topics ranging from energy and waste reduction to environmental compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The awards recognize environmental stewardship among Honda&amp;#39;s nearly 600 parts suppliers in North America, and reflect Honda&amp;#39;s ongoing commitments to protect the environment through its products and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Through this symposium and awards program, Honda encourages all suppliers to achieve excellence in energy reduction, pollution prevention and conservation of natural resources,&amp;quot; said Rich Spivey, senior manager in Honda&amp;#39;s North American Purchasing Division. &amp;quot;It is both gratifying and educational to see how our suppliers are benefitting society by working to reduce their impact on the environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several award winners presented their initiatives to more than 100 suppliers attending the symposium, while many other companies attending the symposium had displays showcasing their environmental improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2010 Honda Green Factory Environmental Achievement Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Conservation of Natural Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;AK Steel Corp.&amp;#39;s Coshocton Works&lt;/strong&gt; restored more than 10 acres into native Ohio prairie land with a walking trail. The restored property at its facility in Coshocton, Ohio, includes nesting boxes for bluebirds and purple martins, as well as native flowers and grasses. The company plans to expand the prairie to more than 20 acres in the future. AK Steel produces flat-rolled steels for the automotive, appliance construction and other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Energy Reduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Delphi Electronics &amp;amp; Safety,&lt;/strong&gt; Reynosa, Mexico, significantly reduced utility usage by improving the efficiency of compressed air use, including eliminating leaks, reducing air pressure, and turning off equipment during non-production and peak periods of electricity use. This facility supplies immobilizers for Honda and Acura automobiles to prevent them from operating under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Highland Industries, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Cheraw, S.C., reduced energy use with efficiency improvements in lighting, compressed air and steam systems. Highland supplies fabric for safety airbags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Neaton Auto Products Mfg., Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Eaton, Ohio, formed an &amp;quot;Energy Conservation Committee&amp;quot; to facilitate efficient use of equipment, compressed air, air conditioning chillers and use of injection molding presses. Neaton manufactures airbag modules, steering wheels, consoles and other plastic injected molded parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Pollution Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Celina Aluminum Precision Technology, Inc. (CAPT),&lt;/strong&gt; Celina, Ohio, reduced wastewater treatment sludge by 58 percent by assembling a team to evaluate pre-treatment operations. CAPT manufactures pistons, cylinder heads, lower blocks and brake knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Nishikawa Standard Company, LLC,&lt;/strong&gt; Topeka, Ind., reduced landfill waste by 83 percent through the recycling and reuse of scrap rubber. Honda is the largest customer for its weather stripping, seals and other rubber materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;TS Trim Industries, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Canal Winchester, Ohio, reduced landfill waste by more than 60 percent through various activities that included recycling metal, wood and other materials, and by reducing waste in the use of adhesives. TS Trim manufactures door liners and other components for Honda and Acura automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Van Rob Stampings, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Manchester, Tenn., became a zero-waste-to-landfill manufacturing facility by recycling packaging, wrapping, office paper, cafeteria waste and other materials. Van Rob manufactures metal stamped components and welded assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Honda in North America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on a philosophy to build products close to customers, Honda began U.S. production of motorcycles in 1979 and automobiles in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio. Since then, the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing has grown to nine U.S. plants among 14 major manufacturing plants in North America. In addition to the Marysville and East Liberty auto plants in Ohio, Honda has established auto plants in Alliston, Ontario; El Salto, Mexico; Lincoln, Alabama, and Greensburg, Ind., and as a result, more than 83 percent of Honda and Acura cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. in 2009 were built in North America. Honda&amp;#39;s parts purchasing totaled more than $13 billion last year from nearly 600 North American suppliers. Honda vehicles are manufactured using domestic and globally-sourced parts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tour of a 'green' tortilla chip manufacturing plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lee Patrick Sullivan tours the Shearer&amp;#39;s tortilla chip factory, the world&amp;#39;s first LEED Platinum certified snack food plant, and interviews its manager, Ken Brower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It starts in the room where Shearer&amp;#39;s unloads its corn from trucks and cooks it using recycled heat from the infrared oven that&amp;#39;s used to bake the chips. That allows water to come into the cooking kettles at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The plant also uses real corn, right off the cob, not corn mash like some other plants. The room is lit using skylights and large windows, and the in-house lighting is adjusted according to the amount of natural light coming in. Brower says this lighting system is the key component that allows the factory to use 30 percent less energy than others of the same size. Brower says it allows the company to buy higher-quality materials and produce a better product than its competitors, while offering it to consumers at a competitive cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brower says the energy-saving components aren&amp;#39;t all that revolutionary, just a lot of commonsense ideas that are being put together in a manufacturing plant for the first time. Brower says the reason other plants don&amp;#39;t have these features is because it would cost a lot of money to retrofit an existing building, Shearer&amp;#39;s was able to save some money by incorporating them into a new plant, but it is getting ready to put some of the same features into an older plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The centerpiece of the plant is its infrared oven, which bakes the chips before they are fried. Brower says the oven is built to save energy by drawing the air it heats from its own output. he compares it to a home chimney, which pulls in air from the bottom, heats it, and sends most of that eat up the chimney. This oven starts with air that has already been heated, so it does not require as much energy to reach the proper baking temperature. He says it&amp;#39;s the first one of its kind and about 47 percent more efficient than others on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Energy management and green manufacturing in the food and beverage industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	When people need energy, they often grab a snack. But have you ever thought about how snack foods could actually save energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Sustainable Snacks, Lee Patrick Sullivan looks at building practices and manufacturing practices that could change not only the food industry, but industry in general. Lee Patrick visits the world&amp;#39;s first LEED Platinum certified snack food factory in Ohio, one that uses the sun for most lighting and an infrared oven to heat its corn chip cooking water. He talks to Energy Secretary Steven Chu at the plant&amp;#39;s opening.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then he buys a Wisconsin man a beer at a sustainable brewery that uses solar power for both heating and beer production, and uses equipment that&amp;#39;s been repurposed from other plants. The factory and brewery owners think the practices he&amp;#39;s seen here can make for more energetic snacks, with less energy wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Preserving and protecting the environment for generations to come is an important aspect of General Mills&amp;rsquo; mission of Nourishing Lives,&amp;rdquo; said Jerry Lynch, chief sustainability officer for General Mills. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re proud of the progress we&amp;rsquo;re making, and we are setting more aggressive goals for even greater progress in the next five years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="bwuline"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Global environmental sustainability goals for 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s new, expanded environmental sustainability goals include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;1. Reducing water usage by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;2. Reducing solid waste generation by 50 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;3. Reducing energy usage by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;4. Reducing greenhouse gas emission by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four global environmental sustainability goals measure the company&amp;rsquo;s global manufacturing operations using rates normalized per metric ton of product. The water usage goal is measured against a 2006 baseline, while the solid waste, energy and greenhouse gas goals are measured against a 2005 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Mills has also established a U.S. transportation goal of reducing the amount of fuel used to ship each pound of product by fiscal 2015, using fiscal 2009 as a baseline. Achieving the U.S. transportation goal would reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions generated by shipping the company&amp;rsquo;s products by 35 percent by fiscal 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Mills also detailed its progress in each category through the end of the company&amp;rsquo;s 2010 fiscal year. Specifically, the company said it has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its water usage rate by 9 percent &amp;ndash; nearly twice the 5 percent goal set in fiscal 2006;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its solid waste generation rate by 33 percent &amp;ndash; more than twice the 15 percent goal set in fiscal year 2005;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its energy consumption rate by 6 percent &amp;ndash; short of the company&amp;rsquo;s 15 percent goal set in fiscal 2005, and;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its greenhouse gas emission rate by 8 percent &amp;ndash; about half the company&amp;rsquo;s 15 percent reduction goal from fiscal 2005.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our 2005 goals were aggressive,&amp;rdquo; said Lynch, &amp;ldquo;and we did not achieve them all. But our progress has been substantial and we are raising the bar. We are learning and improving our capabilities in this area every day. We want to set goals that will stretch us to do more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s continuous improvement initiatives have been especially important in creating even better systems across the company, Lynch explained. &amp;ldquo;Those efforts have really increased our momentum in just the past two years,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;For example, all of the 6 percent reduction we have achieved in energy consumption came in just the last two years. We are gaining momentum, which in turn encourages us to set more aggressive goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are on a journey to stand among the most socially responsible consumer food companies in the world,&amp;rdquo; Lynch concludes. &amp;ldquo;We have a lot of work ahead. But by setting aggressive goals &amp;ndash; and continuing to work to advance our capabilities in this important area &amp;ndash; we are putting in place a road map to the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Smart grid efficiency could make 2010's energy usage 'disappear'</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whenever smart grid experts talk about transforming the nation&amp;rsquo;s aging power grid, the focus is usually on the efficiency that will result. And for good reason &amp;mdash; the potential gains are so huge, they might just exceed our current electrical usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this week&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Energy 2010 Conference in New York City, GE&amp;rsquo;s Bob Gilligan laid out a scenario in which the total U.S. energy consumption and emissions saved between 2010 and 2030 could exceed the entire electrical consumption and electrical CO2 output for all of 2010. &amp;ldquo;The net result would be like 2010 never happened,&amp;rdquo; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gilligan, vice president of digital energy for GE Energy Services, said that in addition to the energy and pollution savings, that scenario would create 140,000 sustainable new jobs and an electrical landscape that includes 3.3 billion fewer customer outage minutes. These improvements could result in savings of $65.7 billion from reduced power interruptions by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, all this good news comes with an ever-growing backdrop of bad news. Gilligan noted that as cities continue to grow around the world, they will house more than 60 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population and consume a vast majority of its power by 2030 &amp;mdash; something that an electricity infrastructure designed a century ago can&amp;rsquo;t supply. For example, approximately half of the transformer equipment powering the U.S. grid is currently at or approaching the end of its design life, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is happening as global electricity demand is forecasted to increase 75 percent by 2030 &amp;mdash; with more than 40 percent of our emissions already coming from electricity generation. At the same time, costs are also rising &amp;mdash; in the U.S., rates increased an average of 42 percent between 2000 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The good news is that we are not talking gloom and doom,&amp;rdquo; he said, underscoring that the technology is ready now and deployable. The key to an energy revolution, he says is to take &amp;ldquo;measured, affordable evolutionary steps.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If that evolution begins now, Gilligan estimates that the power saved will be equal to the output of 64 average coal plants (500 megawatts each) while the CO2 impact will be the equivalent of taking over 25 million cars off the road. Another upside: &amp;ldquo;These are conservative adoption estimates,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;so imagine the benefits if we move more quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Baby steps start now:&lt;/span&gt; Click to enlarge. The smart grid is more than just smart meters. The pie charts indicate the level of adoption/deployment of other key smart grid technologies by 2030. They include: Smart meters, efficiency and reliability technologies, visualization tools to monitor energy use and fully integrated networks that automate power distribution functions.

            <title>Menasha Corporation installs five wind turbines at Wisconsin complex</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Menasha Corporation on November 11 announced that it plans to install five wind turbines for electrical generation at its office and manufacturing complex on the southwest side of Neenah, Wis., along Highway 41. The installation of five wind turbines is the largest announced by a business to date in northeastern Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our renewable energy project is part of the corporation&amp;rsquo;s support of alternative energy solutions and our focus on becoming a leader in sustainability,&amp;rdquo; said Jim Kotek, Menasha Corporation&amp;rsquo;s president and CEO. &amp;ldquo;Earlier this year, we identified sustainability as one of the critical areas in which Menasha must step forward and take a market leadership position. We have now made an important commitment to our community, customers, employees and shareholders by demonstrating that we are serious about improving the environment by using clean energy sources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Menasha Corporation is purchasing five 20-kilowatt wind turbines from Renewegy LLC in Oshkosh, Wis., which specializes in manufacturing wind energy turbines. The turbines are expected to produce enough electrical power to provide for the basic office needs for the 115 employees at the headquarters of the Corporation and Menasha Packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Both of our companies &amp;ndash; Menasha Packaging, which provides paper-based packaging solutions and ORBIS Corporation, which supplies reusable plastic packaging &amp;ndash; have been collaborating with our customers to provide innovative packaging and supply chain solutions that help build a sustainable future,&amp;rdquo; added Mike Waite, president of Menasha Packaging. &amp;ldquo;The turbine project adds wind energy to the list of sustainability projects we have undertaken in our operations over the past couple of years to lessen our impact on the environment. From corrugator upgrades to high efficiency lighting to capturing the latent heat coming off our corrugators to heat other parts of the building, we&amp;rsquo;ve made significant advancements in reducing our carbon footprint.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the renewable energy project, the company is also implementing a number of energy-saving electrical improvements at its Neenah office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The construction of the five wind turbines for Menasha Corporation will make a total of 20 installations made by Renewegy. Jeff Ehlers, president of Renewegy, said, &amp;ldquo;We are very pleased to be partnering with Menasha Corporation on the new installations. Wind is the lowest-cost renewable energy source available to us in the Midwest and installations such as this bring increased attention to the opportunities we have to take advantage of a natural resource that will always be here and one that&amp;rsquo;s free to use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Menasha Corporation has received approval from the City of Neenah&amp;rsquo;s Planning Department for the project and has also completed a site assessment. The company expects to begin construction on footings for the turbines by mid-November; the project will be completed by the end of the year. The turbines will be installed in the greenway between Menasha Packaging&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing plant and its north office building on Bergstrom Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Menasha Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Menasha Corporation is a packaging, logistics and marketing services company based in Neenah, Wisconsin. Established in 1849, it is one of America&amp;rsquo;s oldest privately held manufacturing companies and specializes in corrugated packaging, and high-quality point-of-purchase displays, plastic returnable packaging, in-store consumer promotion and pharmaceutical labeling and packaging.

            <title>Top 10 nations for smart grid investment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Smart grids are the future of energy distribution and represent a significant front in the effort to lower global emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using advanced metering technology, they create a two-way communication between the grid and appliances and are able to smoothly bring more renewable energy into the system. The net result is a more efficient flow and consumption of electricity &amp;mdash; reducing costs for consumers and providers, lowering waste, and making power distribution more scalable to meet growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2010, China is the worldwide leader, having designated $7.32 billion for smart grid investment, based on data from Zpryme Research &amp;amp; Consulting, an Austin, Texas, research and consulting firm that draws on stated federal spending figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The United States&amp;nbsp;was second at $7.09 billion; Japan was a distant third at $849 million and South Korea was fourth at $824 million. The first European nation was Spain, which finished fifth at $807 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The below graphic shows the full top ten, with countries&amp;rsquo; sized relative to smart grid investment amount.&lt;/p&gt;

	Operations are underway at the new Dynamic Fuels plant, which is successfully converting animal fats and greases into high-quality renewable fuels, officials from Syntroleum Corporation and Tyson Foods Inc. announced on November 8. Production at the Geismar, La., plant began in early October and the volume currently being produced is 2,500 barrels per day and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic Fuels LLC is a 50/50 joint venture of Syntroleum and Tyson. Unlike the ethanol and biodiesel industries, which use food ingredients such as corn and soybean oil to produce fuel, Dynamic Fuels uses non-food-grade animal fats and greases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re very pleased with the progress at the plant and the quality of the fuel it&amp;rsquo;s producing,&amp;rdquo; said Jeff Webster, group vice president of Tyson&amp;rsquo;s Renewable Products Division. &amp;ldquo;This fuel offers the same benefits of synthetic fuels derived from coal or natural gas, including substantial performance and environmental advantages over petroleum-based fuels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, the Geismar plant has manufactured renewable diesel with a cloud point as low as minus-26 degrees Fahrenheit and cetane as high as 88, more than twice that of the ASTM petroleum diesel specification. The facility&amp;rsquo;s renewable diesel fuel product meets all ASTM D975 specifications for diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gary Roth, chief executive officer of Syntroleum, said, &amp;ldquo;Our U.S. plant is producing some of the highest quality diesel fuel in the world, and best of all, it is renewable with a carbon footprint 75 percent below that of petroleum diesel. We can also make renewable, high value specialty distillate products that can be used in a wide variety of applications such as dry cleaning, ink cartridges and drilling fluids, and we are actively pursuing these markets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first shipments of fuel started leaving the Geismar plant in October. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s been tremendous interest in our fuels and so far our customers include a range of fuel distributors and end users, including the U.S. military,&amp;rdquo; said Bob Ames, vice president of renewable energy for Tyson Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic Fuels has been making jet fuel for testing by the Air Force Research Laboratory. This is the first renewable jet fuel to be tested by the Air Force that has been produced in a domestic commercial scale facility. &amp;ldquo;We look forward to working with the Air Force in its fuel certification program,&amp;rdquo; said Ames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tyson and Syntroleum officials remain hopeful Congress will restore the $1 per gallon renewable diesel tax credit that expired in December 2009. Fuel from the Geismar plant qualifies for the credit, which would help the economic feasibility of the operation and help recover development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;More consistent and timely action by Congress on this and other biofuels tax credits is needed to provide stability and encourage the growth of the advanced biofuels industry, which is poised to help reduce the nation&amp;rsquo;s dependence on foreign oil,&amp;rdquo; said Webster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility uses Syntroleum&amp;rsquo;s Bio-Synfining Technology to produce the renewable fuels from non-food grade animal fats produced or procured by Tyson Foods, such as beef tallow, pork lard, chicken fat and greases. The plant is designed to produce up to 75 million gallons of renewable fuels per year. The operation currently has 44 permanent full-time positions on site and maintains 13 full-time start-up support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Syntroleum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Syntroleum Corporation owns the Syntroleum Process for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion of synthesis gas derived from biomass, coal, natural gas and other carbon-based feedstocks into liquid hydrocarbons, the Synfining Process for upgrading FT liquid hydrocarbons into middle distillate products such as synthetic diesel and jet fuels, and the Bio-Synfining technology for converting animal fat and vegetable oil feedstocks into middle distillate products such as renewable diesel and jet fuel using inedible fats and greases as feedstock. The 50/50 venture &amp;ndash; known as Dynamic Fuels &amp;ndash; was formed to construct and operate multiple renewable synthetic fuels facilities, with production on the first site beginning in 2010. The company plans to use its portfolio of technologies to develop and participate in synthetic and renewable fuel projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda Manufacturing of Indiana receives LEED Green Building Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda Manufacturing of Indiana LLC (HMIN) in Greensburg, Ind., has received LEED Green Building Certification for its Welcome Center, the company announced on November 8. The center is the ninth Honda facility in North America to earn LEED certification since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a rating system for many types of building construction including new construction and is awarded by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI). The GBCI recognizes excellence in green building practice and performance globally through its third-party certification services. HMIN is the first company to receive this distinction in Decatur County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Honda associates are engaged in broad-based efforts to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment,&amp;quot; said HMIN vice president Rick Schostek. &amp;quot;This certification is further evidence of our commitment locally to ensure that our Greensburg plant remains at the leading edge of Honda&amp;#39;s global &amp;quot;green factory&amp;quot; initiative.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HMIN&amp;#39;s Welcome Center was evaluated in six categories: Sustainable Site, Water Efficiency, Energy &amp;amp; Atmosphere, Materials &amp;amp; Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality and Innovative Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;One of our approaches is the purchase of 100 percent green power for the Welcome Center,&amp;quot; said Craig Lloyd, Facilities department manager. &amp;quot;We also installed bicycle storage and shower facilities for associates and utilized lumber from the Forest Stewardship Council for sustainable forests in construction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, HMIN designated fuel-efficient vehicle parking in the visitor lot and has campus-wide recycling that contributed points to the LEED certification process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even outside of the LEED certification process, HMIN has been focused on the environment starting before the plant began mass production two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Honda built the Greensburg plant with the environment in mind,&amp;quot; added Schostek. &amp;quot;Our campus features seven lakes, two water quality ponds, and we are a zero waste-to-landfill facility, which means no waste from our plant goes to a landfill - it is either recycled or reused.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, trees and earthen embankments provide a natural buffer between the plant and its neighbors in the Greensburg area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HMIN also produces the natural gas-powered Honda Civic GX, the cleanest internal combustion engine vehicle ever certified by the U.S. EPA, along with the ultra-low emissions Civic 4-door sedan using domestic and globally sourced parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Civic GX has received top environmental awards including the American Council for Energy-Efficient Economy&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;America&amp;#39;s Greenest Car&amp;quot; award for five consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda has also demonstrated leadership in reducing waste to landfills from manufacturing activity in North America. Eight of Honda&amp;#39;s North American plants, including HMIN, achieved zero waste to landfill, as Honda moves closer to its goal of achieving zero waste to landfill for all 14 of its plants in the region by April 1, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HMIN currently operates one shift with approximately 1,000 associates at the Greensburg plant. The 26,400 square foot Welcome Center, which is connected to the plant via a skywalk, serves as HMIN&amp;#39;s visitor entrance and includes a lobby, auditorium, meeting rooms, locker rooms and security offices. HMIN is Honda&amp;#39;s seventh auto plant in North America and one of 14 major Honda manufacturing facilities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Kimberly-Clark displays environmental leadership with carbon offsetting program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Fast on the heels of unveiling its new environmentally responsible trade show booth in July, Kimberly-Clark Professional is taking the next step in reducing the environmental impact of its trade show activities through a partnership with Carbonfund.org. Starting with its exhibit at the ISSA/INTERCLEAN Show, November 9-12 in Orlando, Fla., Kimberly-Clark Professional will offset the carbon emissions associated with its trade show activities and the activities of customers visiting its booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Carbon offsets are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, an important component of environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Reducing our carbon footprint is one of the best ways that individuals and companies alike can lessen our impact on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate and provide for a more sustainable future,&amp;rdquo; says Lisa Morden, global sustainability leader for Kimberly-Clark Professional. &amp;ldquo;Combined with our sustainable trade show booth design, we now have a more holistic approach to environmental sustainability relating to trade show activities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the Program Works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To implement its carbon offsetting trade show program, Kimberly-Clark Professional and its exhibit design firm, Expotechnik, have partnered with Carbonfund.org, a well-recognized nonprofit provider of carbon offsets and climate solutions organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kimberly-Clark Professional will work with Carbonfund.org to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions generated by employee travel, shipping of the trade show booth and related materials, hotel stays, meals eaten, and booth electricity use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on those calculations, Kimberly-Clark Professional will donate an equivalent amount of money to one of Carbonfund.org&amp;rsquo;s reforestation carbon reduction projects. The Amazon Forest Conservation Project, for example, will protect up to millions of acres from slash-and-burn forest clearing and prevent tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The project will also provide essential ecosystem services such as erosion control; water cycling, filtration and storage; nutrient recycling; and habitat for thousands of native Amazonian animal and plant species. Carbon offsets generated from these projects are then retired on behalf of Kimberly-Clark Professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offsetting Attendee Carbon Footprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In what is likely to be an industry first, Kimberly-Clark Professional also will offset the carbon dioxide emissions of the ISSA/INTERCLEAN attendees who visit its booth. Together with Carbonfund.org, Kimberly-Clark Professional will calculate the carbon dioxide emissions generated by attendees&amp;rsquo; roundtrip travel, meals eaten, hotel room stays and their share of the event&amp;rsquo;s overall estimated energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Attendees will enter their information into an interactive offset tool at the Kimberly-Clark Professional booth. Once registered, they will receive a special badge identifying them as carbon offsetters and will be given the option of supporting Carbonfund.org&amp;rsquo;s reforestation, energy efficiency or renewable energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Sustainable Booth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The new carbon offsetting program will become an integral part of Kimberly-Clark Professional&amp;rsquo;s Reduce Today, Respect Tomorrow global environmental sustainability program, which takes a big-picture approach to sustainability by seeking to reduce environmental impact at every stage of business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In July, Kimberly-Clark Professional unveiled a new environmentally responsible trade show booth, made of materials comprised of approximately 90 percent post-consumer recycled, rented or re-used products. These materials are nearly 100 percent recyclable or re-usable so that when the booth is no longer needed, the materials can be used again. In fact, about 60 percent of the materials are directly re-usable, meaning they can be returned to inventory without expending energy to recreate or recycle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The booth design is also environmentally responsible in terms of use, weight, transportation, life cycle and the incorporation of audio-visual technology to reduce costly graphic production and impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More information about Kimberly-Clark Professional&amp;rsquo;s environmental sustainability programs can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.kcpreducetoday.com/us"&gt;www.kcpreducetoday.com/us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are Carbon Offsets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Carbon offsets are measured in metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalents; one carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies and other organizations may offset emissions in support of carbon reduction projects to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are permitted to emit. Organizations and individuals may also offset to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from activities such as travel and electricity use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Carbon offsetting is an effective approach for reducing the carbon footprint of trade show activities, including travel &amp;ndash; often long distances by air &amp;ndash; and shipping of items such as trade show booths, sample products, literature, etc. &amp;ndash; all of which generate greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Kimberly-Clark Professional&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Kimberly-Clark Professional is an indispensable business partner, delivering leading-edge health, hygiene and productivity solutions that provide tangible value every day, everywhere. Kimberly-Clark Professional is also committed to reducing environmental impact at every stage in a product&amp;rsquo;s life cycle with its Reduce Today, Respect Tomorrow program.

            <title>GM publishes 'Blue Paper' for sustainable urban mobility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On November 7, General Motors published its &amp;quot;Blue Paper&amp;quot; for sustainable urban mobility -&amp;nbsp;a road map for overcoming mobility and urbanization challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Blue Paper addresses the growing challenges associated with rising urbanization and the greater demand for transportation with respect to energy, the environment, safety, traffic congestion and land use. It envisions a new automobile DNA based on electrification and connectivity, and promises a cleaner, safer and more convenient future for urban transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;GM&amp;rsquo;s Vision of Sustainable Urban Mobility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Blue Paper integrates learnings and feedback from GM&amp;rsquo;s six &amp;ldquo;Drive to 2030&amp;rdquo;: Sustainable Urban Mobility forums, which took place from May to October at the SAIC-GM Pavilion at World Expo 2010 Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Blue Paper is an important document that integrates the learnings from our forums and participation in Expo 2010, which have provided a compelling vision of the future of the automobile and urban communities,&amp;rdquo; according to Kevin Wale, President and Managing Director of the GM China Group. &amp;ldquo;This vision, which GM is proud to document in the Blue Paper, serves as a roadmap to the electrification, connectivity, creative design, and advanced innovation strategies that will lead the world to sustainable urban mobility by 2030.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In GM&amp;rsquo;s vision of sustainable urban mobility, vehicles of the future will be increasingly powered by electricity, connected continuously to the communications infrastructure, electronically controlled, autonomously driven when desired, and flexibly designed to meet specific usage requirements. With this vision, GM proposes specific objectives for future mobility. Driving in the future will become cleaner, safer, less petroleum-dependent, more convenient, and more fun and fashionable than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Electrification, Connectivity, Creative Design will Change Automobile DNA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Electrification, connectivity and creative design are key components of the technology solutions that GM has offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is important that those with a stake in the future act now to achieve a new vision of sustainable personal mobility,&amp;rdquo; said Wale. &amp;ldquo;By electrifying, connecting, and redesigning our vehicles &amp;ndash; and by integrating them with the energy, communications, and transportation infrastructure &amp;ndash; we will ensure that future vehicles are in harmony with society&amp;rsquo;s needs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three new-energy vehicles &amp;ndash; the Chevrolet Volt, EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) concept, and Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell electric vehicle &amp;ndash; which GM is showing at EVS25, demonstrate the progress that the company has made in electrification, connectivity and creative design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A Call for the Promotion of Sustainable Urban Mobility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Blue Paper offers eight recommendations for overcoming the challenges associated with the rising demand for personal mobility and growing urbanization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accelerate and encourage the move to the electrification of the automobile, including the development of key vehicle components, a smart power grid, and a comprehensive urban recharging infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase the diversity of energy sources, particularly the development of a broad array of renewable sources, to support low-emission pathways to electrification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leverage connectivity by ensuring a high-quality wireless communications infrastructure and encouraging the rapid development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and related intelligent transportation technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a sophisticated, integrated, intelligent transportation system that dynamically manages large transportation flows using the latest communications and computer controls.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Integrate electrically powered, connected vehicles into a multi-modal transport system that incorporates sophisticated inter-city transport, comprehensive subway systems, traditional vehicle movement, and specialized smaller urban vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Align government tax, regulatory, and procurement policies to support the vision of connected electrically driven vehicles. Specific globally consistent codes and standards should be developed. Government organizations should also support funding to encourage continued electric vehicle research and development and consumer incentives to support the transition to new energy vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Begin to optimize the physical infrastructure to support new urban vehicles through active collaboration and cooperation among urban planning authorities, think tanks, academic institutions, automotive companies, and infrastructure companies.&lt;br /&gt;
		Identify a series of &amp;ldquo;lighthouse&amp;rdquo; projects to rapidly demonstrate the viability and potential of connected electrically driven vehicles in a controlled environment such as an eco-city or small town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Realizing the vision of sustainable mobility requires cooperation among government institutions, the automotive industry, infrastructure developers, and the academic community. Through its eight recommendations, GM is committed to working closely with stakeholders to drive the automotive industry to a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM is showcasing its leadership in electric vehicle technology at EVS25, which runs from November 4-9. In line with the theme of its stand &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The Road to the Future&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it is introducing the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric vehicle, the EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) concept, and the Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell electric vehicle. All three vehicles were part of GM&amp;rsquo;s participation in Expo 2010 from May 1-October 31. During EVS25, GM is also hosting a test drive of the Volt and Equinox Fuel Cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/ZF3wroBmJqo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>TVA keeps reliability high, prices low during challenging year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Tennessee Valley Authority delivered good performance in 2010, keeping reliability high and prices competitive, despite stress that extreme weather placed on TVA&amp;#39;s electric power infrastructure, president and CEO Tom Kilgore told the utility&amp;#39;s board of directors on Thursday, November 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Increased power demand during a record-hot summer and an unusual winter cold snap caused TVA to call higher-cost peak-power generation facilities into service more often, to purchase extra power from other companies during high-use times and to work harder to manage weather-related strains on high-voltage transmission lines and other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But TVA&amp;#39;s employees met the challenges, keeping the power on 99.999 percent of the time, among the best in the utility industry, for the 11th straight year and holding average retail prices to 7.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, down from 8.4 cents in 2009 and well below the U.S. average for electric bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, marked a major turnaround from 2009, when sales and revenues dropped during the economic recession, Kilgore told the board, which held its November meeting at TVA&amp;#39;s Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It was a good year for TVA operationally and financially, which means it was a good year for TVA&amp;#39;s customers,&amp;quot; Kilgore said, emphasizing that TVA expects no increase in its base rates for fiscal 2011. &amp;quot;The work our employees did to manage a hot and difficult summer resulted in millions of dollars in savings for TVA and the people we serve.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TVA staff reported that TVA&amp;#39;s tax equivalent payments to state and local governments reached $550 million in fiscal year 2010, a 9 percent increase from 2009. Under the TVA Act, which established the federal utility in 1933, TVA makes payments to eight states and 144 local governments where it owns facilities. The payments compensate state and local governments that cannot levy property taxes on federal entities. Tax equivalent payments have been part of TVA&amp;#39;s operations and corporate citizenship since its early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Discussing TVA&amp;#39;s renewed vision to be one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading producers of cleaner low-cost electricity by 2020, Kilgore remarked that the Browns Ferry plant will play a key role in TVA&amp;#39;s future because nuclear power produces no air emissions, including carbon. TVA plans to pursue its vision by focusing on more nuclear power and energy efficiency in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Browns Ferry is TVA&amp;#39;s first and largest nuclear plant,&amp;quot; Kilgore said, pointing out that the plant&amp;#39;s Unit 1 reactor recently completed 586 days of continuous generation. The plant&amp;#39;s Unit 3 reactor ran for 669 continuous days in 2002, one of the longest runs in industry history that produced 18 million megawatt-hours of electricity, a world record at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hot summer weather had an impact on Browns Ferry when rising river temperatures forced TVA to cut back the plant&amp;#39;s output to prevent warm water produced by reactor cooling systems from entering the Tennessee River and potentially harming fish. To address high river temperatures in the future, the TVA board approved funding to build additional cooling towers at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kilgore also reaffirmed TVA&amp;#39;s commitment to reducing peak power use across the seven-state region served by the utility. He said TVA had surpassed its 2010 goal to reduce the need for peak power by 102 megawatts through energy efficiency and demand management programs.&amp;nbsp; Fiscal year 2010&amp;#39;s incremental reduction of 114 megawatts means TVA has cumulatively reduced peak power demand by 317 megawatts during the past three years - about one-third to one-half of a new power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Peak power times usually occur on hot summer afternoons and cold winter mornings when people use more electricity, forcing utilities to switch on higher-cost generation plants to meet the additional demand. Reducing peak demand, therefore, lowers costs for utilities and, ultimately, for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The board also reviewed fiscal 2011 executive compensation and incentive pay plans, which are based on achieving business goals that help make TVA operations more efficient and hold down costs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Tennessee Valley Authority, a corporation owned by the U.S. government, provides electricity for utility and business customers in most of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia &amp;ndash; an area of 80,000 square miles with a population of 9 million. TVA operates 29 hydroelectric dams, 11 coal-fired power plants, three nuclear plants and 11 natural gas-fired power facilities and supplies up to 33,700 megawatts of electricity, delivered over 16,000 miles of high-voltage power lines. TVA also provides flood control, navigation, land management and recreation for the Tennessee River system and works with local utilities and state and local governments to promote economic development across the region. TVA, which makes no profits and receives no taxpayer money, is funded by sales of electricity to its customers. Electricity prices in TVA&amp;#39;s service territory are below the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/O560KEFiP40" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>After 40 years, father of electric vehicle R&amp;D finally sees tipping point</title>

		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For almost 40 years, the world&amp;rsquo;s population has faced an indisputable fact: our energy needs are outpacing our supply. And now, the need for new energy technologies is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When GE Global Research&amp;rsquo;s Bob King built his first electric car in 1972, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the barest inkling of the energy problems yet to come &amp;mdash; he just thought it was a cool idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s Grove City College, King wrote a paper that claimed we would be driving electric vehicles within his lifetime. &amp;ldquo;After I graduated, suddenly I had some extra time, so I went back and wondered if what I wrote back in [college] made sense,&amp;rdquo; he told GE Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working with a Volkswagen chassis, a DC motor, and lead acid batteries, King jerry-rigged an electric car that could rumble down the road for up to 50 miles on a single charge. Since the commute to his new job at GE was just 20 miles, he could make it there and back with a few miles to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But as the energy crisis of the 1970s took root, King realized that he was almost unique on the road: &amp;ldquo;I was not waiting in line for gas like so many of my colleagues were.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thus began his thirty-year quest to build a better electric vehicle. In late 1979, GE won a contract with the Department of Energy to build more efficient cars, and King was appointed project engineer for a new hybrid test vehicle. He sweated over batteries that weighed 700 pounds, and struggled to find ways to keep costs down and make the cars affordable for the average consumer. And since the energy crisis was in full swing, he figured that demand would make his dream of an electric-car world an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, in the early 1980s, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I thought that in five years, maybe [EVs] would be commercially viable,&amp;rdquo; King says. &amp;ldquo;But once the price of gas settled at a dollar a gallon, there was no shortage of gasoline. The energy crisis was over, and everyone went back to consuming gas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nevertheless, concerns about air pollution and global warming eventually brought EVs back into the public eye. In partnership with Ford, King and his GE team switched gears, focusing on reducing emissions by larger vehicles &amp;mdash; first vans, then heavy industrial mining trucks and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There was no way that the emission problem was going to go away overnight,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;So I changed the thrust of the program to what can we do to minimize emissions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under King&amp;rsquo;s leadership, GE proved it was technically feasible to greatly reduce emissions on a public transit bus, which led to New York&amp;rsquo;s first hybrid buses in 1996. It paved the way for today&amp;rsquo;s hybrid buses and established the emissions requirements for New York City&amp;rsquo;s hybrid transit buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now at last, the EV focus as returned to consumer vehicles. After thirty-plus years, King still recalls when he thought such cars were merely five years away. He&amp;rsquo;s a little older and a little wiser, but he&amp;rsquo;s still convinced that electric cars are the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had the hybrids in the late &amp;lsquo;70s and pure electrics, but the battery technology still wasn&amp;rsquo;t there,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;Now we&amp;rsquo;re seeing the battery technology has improved, and we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a 100-mile range on a single charge. We&amp;rsquo;re not all going to be driving electric vehicles in five years, but a great deal of people will. Especially with a second car, which many people use to drive less than forty miles a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With India and China increasing the demand for oil, I think we&amp;rsquo;re at a turning point. And the good news is, the tech is maturing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Panasonic invests $30M in Tesla; companies strengthen collaborative relationship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Panasonic Corporation and Tesla Motors&amp;nbsp;on November 3 announced that Panasonic has invested $30 million in Tesla. The investment was made through the purchase of Tesla common stock in a private placement at a price of $21.15 per share. The investment builds upon a multi-year collaboration of the two companies to accelerate the market expansion of the electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Panasonic is the world&amp;rsquo;s leading battery cell manufacturer and a diverse supplier to the global automotive industry. Tesla currently uses Panasonic battery cells in its advanced battery packs and has collaborated with Panasonic on the development of next generation battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles. While Tesla&amp;rsquo;s current battery strategy incorporates proprietary packaging using cells from multiple battery suppliers, Tesla has selected Panasonic as its preferred lithium-ion battery cell supplier for its battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Panasonic aims to be the number one Green Innovation Company in the Electronics Industry by 2018, the 100th anniversary of our founding,&amp;rdquo; said Naoto Noguchi, president of Energy Company, a unit of Panasonic responsible for the battery cell business. &amp;ldquo;Our sophisticated lithium-ion battery cell technology, combined with Tesla&amp;rsquo;s market-leading EV powertrain technology, helps us fulfill this goal by promoting sustainable mobility. We are proud to strengthen our relationship with Tesla Motors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is an honor and a powerful endorsement of our technology that Panasonic, the world&amp;rsquo;s leading battery cell manufacturer, would choose to invest in and partner with Tesla,&amp;rdquo; said Tesla CEO and co-founder Elon Musk. &amp;ldquo;Panasonic offers the highest energy-density cells and industry-leading performance with cutting edge Nickel-type cathode technology. We believe our partnership with them will enable us to further improve our battery pack while reducing cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to producing its own vehicles, Tesla also builds electric powertrains, including battery packs, for other automobile manufacturers. Panasonic and Tesla intend to explore joint marketing and sales of battery packs that would be designed and assembled by Tesla using Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s battery cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Panasonic &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Panasonic Corporation is a worldwide leader in the development and manufacture of electronic products for a wide range of consumer, business, and industrial needs. Based in Osaka, Japan, the company recorded consolidated net sales of 7.42 trillion yen (US$79.4 billion) for the year ended March 31, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Tesla Motors &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tesla&amp;#39;s goal is to produce a full range of electric cars, from premium sports cars to mass market vehicles &amp;ndash; relentlessly driving down the cost of electric vehicles. It is currently the only automaker in the U.S. that builds and sells highway-capable EVs in serial production. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla designs and manufactures EVs and EV powertrain components. Tesla has delivered more than 1,300 Roadsters to customers in North America, Europe and Asia. The Tesla Roadster accelerates faster than most sports cars yet produces no emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Alstom inaugurates hydropower manufacturing facility in China</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Alstom on November 4 inaugurated its new hydropower manufacturing facility at Tianjin in China. The new factory will place Alstom in a better position to supply its customers in China and abroad, while offering opportunities for further expansion in China&amp;rsquo;s healthy hydropower market, which accounts for 22 percent of the country&amp;rsquo;s electricity generation capacity and is expanding at a rate of 15 gigawatts per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new site is to be named Alstom Hydro China Company Ltd. (AHC) and will, over time, fully replace Alstom&amp;rsquo;s original factory in China, Tianjin Alstom Hydro (TAH). Its construction is taking place in two main phases, with phase one already operational. To ensure gradual transition of the workload, Alstom&amp;rsquo;s existing factory TAH will remain operational until the second phase has been fully completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Representing an investment of one billion RMB (just under &amp;euro;110 million), AHC is Alstom&amp;rsquo;s first carbon-neutral manufacturing site in China. Its energy-efficient design includes double insulation, heat recovery systems, a geothermal heating and cooling system that consumes 43 percent less energy, rainwater recycling and solar photovoltaic panels that will provide electricity for heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation for the entire factory. In addition, skylights have been installed to take full advantage of natural light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy efficiency in buildings is at the top of the Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s agenda in honoring its commitment to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels, following its promise for a 20 percent cut by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AHC will have a total area of nearly 250,000 square metres and a production capacity that is 20 percent greater than the old site, capable of delivering up to 30 turbine and generator units per year with outputs ranging from 20 megawatts to 1000 MW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;AHC places us in a great position to respond to demand and execute our order backlog in the Asian region, as well as having an eco-friendly design,&amp;rdquo; said Philippe Joubert, president of Alstom Power and executive vice president of Alstom. &amp;ldquo;Its new location in the TAEZ industrial zone near Tianjin Airport provides us a lot of room for potential further expansion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility will house a Global Technology Center where Alstom will carry out R&amp;amp;D activities and test turbines developed for its customers. It will be Alstom Hydro&amp;rsquo;s third global technology centre, following the opening of Alstom&amp;rsquo;s centers in Grenoble, France, and Vadodara, India, in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Alstom is one of the leading hydro producers in China and, to date, has signed contracts for hydro turbines and generators covering 43 GW in the country, out of which approximately 28 GW are already in commercial operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On November 4, Alstom announced it had won a further &amp;euro;50 million contract to supply five 40 MW units for the Xiajiang hydroelectric project in Jiangxi province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Alstom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Snyderâs of Hanover begins construction of solar farm</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover will begin construction on a solar farm that will be the largest ground-based solar energy system in Pennsylvania, with more than 16,000 panels spanning 20 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After gaining approval from the Penn Township Planning and Zoning Board to build the solar farm, Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover plans to begin construction in November. The solar farm will be built on the field across Route 116 from the plant and corporate headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re incredibly eager to take the next step in reducing our carbon footprint. This is an exciting event for our company, community and environment,&amp;rdquo; said Jim Butt, vice president of technical services at Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover and project manager for the solar project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar farm will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in excess of 230 million pounds of carbon dioxide over a 25-year period. As a comparison, the energy created from the solar field equals more than 111 million miles not driven by a medium-sized car and more than 11 million trees would need to be planted to equal the same level of carbon dioxide reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are always looking for ways to be a greener and environmentally friendly company and the solar farm is an important step. The solar field joins other Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover sustainability initiatives, including compostable packaging, and takes the company one step closer to achieving our five-year sustainability goals established last year. It demonstrates that we can still be passionate about pretzels and better-for-you snack foods while caring for our environment,&amp;rdquo; said Carl E. Lee, Jr., president and CEO of Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The global leader in pretzels and the nation&amp;rsquo;s second-largest snack food company, Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover was founded in 1909 and is a privately held company that employs more than 2,250 associates and operates nearly 1,900 distribution routes nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Snyder&amp;rsquo;s is headquartered in Hanover, Pa., also the location of its flagship snack food manufacturing and distribution center where products are produced and distributed to the eastern half of North America, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Europe. The Goodyear, Ariz., plant produces products for the Western half of the United States and Pacific Rim countries. The Jeffersonville, Indiana &amp;ldquo;Krunchers!&amp;rdquo; plant produces and distributes Krunchers!kettle potato chips, Jays potato chips, and Grandetortilla chip products primarily for the Midwest, Central, and Eastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Intel heads EPA list of top green power purchasers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on November 1 released its list of the top 50 organizations using the most renewable electricity. The Green Power Partnership&amp;rsquo;s top purchasers use more than 12 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power annually, equivalent to avoiding the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the electricity use of more than 1 million average American homes. Green power is generated from renewable resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biogas and low-impact hydropower.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Intel Corporation tops the list as the partnership&amp;rsquo;s largest single purchaser of green power and was recently honored with a 2010 EPA Green Power Leadership Award for green power purchasing. The company uses more than 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually, equivalent to avoiding the CO2 emissions from the electricity use of nearly 125,000 average American homes. Both Kohl&amp;rsquo;s Department Stores and Whole Foods Market received the 2010 EPA Green Power Partner of the Year Awards, and came in as second and third this quarter in purchasing green power. Reaching the top five for the first time, Starbucks (No. 4) more than doubled its annual green power purchase to more than 573 million kWh of green power equivalent to avoiding the CO2 emissions from the electricity use of nearly 50,000 average American homes annually. Also in the top five is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which increased its green power purchase to 500 million kWh of green power annually. Rounding out the top 10 are the City of Houston, Dell Inc., Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, the U.S. Air Force and the City of Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA&amp;rsquo;s Green Power Partnership works with nearly 1,300 partner organizations to voluntarily purchase green power to reduce the environmental impacts of conventional electricity use. Overall, EPA&amp;rsquo;s Green Power Partners are using nearly 18 billion kWh of green power annually, equivalent to avoiding the CO2 emissions from the electricity use of more than 1.5 million average American homes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Green power resources produce electricity with an environmental profile superior to conventional power technologies and produce no net increase to greenhouse gas emissions. Purchases of green power also help accelerate the development of new renewable energy capacity nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Ford taps experts to examine opportunities, challenges of electric cars</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company on October 29 convened key experts from the city of Chicago and ComEd to examine critical issues related to consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Ford has been working to engage utilities, city and state governments and infrastructure providers in efforts to promote the commercialization of electrified vehicles to reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ford has an aggressive plan to bring five new electrified vehicles to market over the next two years including the Transit Connect Electric later this year and the Ford Focus Electric in 2011,&amp;quot; said Sherif Marakby, director of electrification program and engineering, Ford Motor Company. &amp;quot;There is incredible excitement for electric vehicles in the Chicago area. To support the rollout and acceptance of these vehicles in Chicago and across the country, it is critical to work with local utilities and cities to make sure the necessary electric infrastructure and grid is ready for both vehicles and consumers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford plans to work with utilities as well as state and local officials to address issues related to the permitting and regulations that can support electric vehicle infrastructure. An easy charging station permitting process is considered an important element for electric vehicle acceptance in the Chicago area, Illinois and across the country. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Electric vehicles will be a key new technology in helping to reach the goals of the Chicago Climate Action Plan,&amp;quot; said Suzanne Malec-McKenna, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Environment. &amp;quot;We are excited about bringing electric vehicles to Chicago so that residents and businesses can take full advantage of the benefits these vehicles offer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;quot;Charging Into the Future &amp;ndash; Ford Electric Vehicle Tour,&amp;quot; which kicked off at Portland State University in Portland, Ore., last month, is visiting 14 key cities to promote Ford&amp;#39;s electric vehicle strategy as well as educate consumers about what to expect from electrified automobiles and what is needed from the public and private sector to support this new technology. Chicago and Detroit were the only two Midwest cities included in the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the next two years, Ford will introduce the Transit Connect Electric small commercial van (2010), Focus Electric passenger car (2011), two third-generation lithium-ion battery hybrids (2012) and a plug-in hybrid (2012). These vehicles will achieve breakthrough efficiency; some, like the pure battery electric Transit Connect Electric and Focus Electric, will use no gasoline at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electrification is an important piece of Ford&amp;#39;s overall product sustainability strategy that features a range of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel technologies including EcoBoost engines, six-speed transmissions, electric power-assisted steering, aerodynamic improvements and light-weighting materials. Ford&amp;#39;s electrification strategy also leverages the most fuel-efficient powertrains, the most technically competent hybrids and global vehicle platforms in order to develop affordable, fuel-efficient choices for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/Os7Xc7hq-Gs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toro partners with ATK to develop fuel cell-powered utility vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Toro Company was selected by ATK, an aerospace and defense company, to help design and build two fuel cell powered utility vehicles with advanced hydrogen storage technology. The project is part of a contract awarded to ATK by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, which is collaborating with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to coordinate hydrogen storage development efforts for the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As partner in the project, Toro provides extensive operational experience in the area of fuel cell technologies having recently completed a three-year demonstration with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The NYSERDA project used three prototype hydrogen-powered Toro Workman utility vehicles at various sites, including Niagara Falls State Park, Bethpage State Park and Rockefeller Plaza Government Center. These vehicles operated reliably in shuttling workers and grounds equipment, hauling turf materials, and assisting with refuse removal. The demonstration proved fuel cells technically viable and feedback from operators was consistently positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With proven experience in mobile fuel cell technology and off-road utility vehicle application, Toro caught the attention of ATK&amp;rsquo;s Center for Energy and Aerospace Innovation (CEAI), based in Ronkonkoma, New York. Toro&amp;rsquo;s Center for Advanced Turf Technology (CATT) will assist in designing two operational machines based on the Toro Workman chassis and similar to what the company successfully demonstrated in New York. The group will also provide technical expertise on end-use applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to partner on this project to leverage our field experience and further our efforts in the development of alternative fuel solutions,&amp;rdquo; said Dana Lonn, director of Toro&amp;rsquo;s CATT Group. &amp;ldquo;Our motivation in alternative energy is to reduce emissions, hydraulic leaks and noise levels for our customers. Therefore, we need to remain aggressive in identifying the best technologies to deliver these results at a competitive price.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fuel cell utility vehicles, powered by a solid hydrogen storage system, are scheduled for delivery later this fall to the DLA for a 12-month operational demonstration. During this time, the vehicles will retrieve and transport materials between warehouses with data being collected to better understand the performance, durability and sustainability of the hydrogen fuel cell system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shaped by concerns over energy usage and the environment, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires that the U.S. Department of Defense reduce oil consumption rates by 20 percent before the end of 2015. The energy law also establishes a hydrogen and fuel cell program with a goal of producing commercial fuel cell vehicles and developing hydrogen infrastructure by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/3hRA3_iPK8c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why electric vehicles need a smarter grid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With electric vehicle adoption by consumers heading toward a tipping point, utilities and cities are busy planning just how to meet the power demands of millions of EVs. &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/10/29/smart-grid-recharging-technology-electric-vehicles.html?boxes=techchanneltopstories" jquery1288613197367="8"&gt;In an essay published today in &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; GE&amp;rsquo;s Bob Gilligan, who is the vice president for GE&amp;rsquo;s digital energy business, makes the case that the environmental and economical benefits of EVs will be stunted if their cords don&amp;rsquo;t plug into a smarter grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wattstation-home.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Grid ready:&lt;/span&gt; EV chargers like &lt;a href="http://www.geindustrial.com/products/static/WattStation/" jquery1288613197367="9"&gt;GE&amp;rsquo;s WattStation&lt;/a&gt; feature smart grid connections and faster refueling times.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With charging infrastructure still in the early development phase, &amp;ldquo;the novelty of a few electric cars can be absorbed by the current power system,&amp;rdquo; he writes. &amp;ldquo;But as more EVs replace regular cars, they could overtax the current power grid if they aren&amp;rsquo;t charged at off-peak times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;During peak periods &amp;mdash; the time of greatest power demand &amp;mdash; utilities are forced to activate additional, more expensive &amp;lsquo;peaker plants&amp;rsquo; to meet spikes in energy demand. Those increased operating costs translate into higher consumption costs for consumers. Which means it&amp;rsquo;s more economical for EV drivers to recharge when the power is &amp;lsquo;on sale&amp;rsquo; during off-peak periods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Bob explains, the national EV infrastructure envisioned by industry players is more than just chargers in home garages. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s nothing short of &amp;ldquo;electrified versions of gas pumps&amp;rdquo; that will be needed. He says that &amp;ldquo;by 2015 there will be an estimated 3 million EV charging stations installed worldwide; this year, a mere 20,000 installations are forecast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The net takeaway, Bob writes, is that the grid needs to be upgraded to support the new EV world. Not doing it will also &amp;ldquo;keep some consumers away until a comprehensive infrastructure is in place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make this happen, he says, partnerships need to be forged to develop technology standards so utilities and tech companies can be on the same page and know how to invest. On the consumer side, increased awareness about exactly what a smart grid is &amp;ndash; and how it&amp;rsquo;s needed for EVs, needs to happen at the same time. &amp;ldquo;Only then will we get the most out of an electrified transportation network,&amp;rdquo; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Nissan presents mobility concept for sustainable zero-emission society</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company Ltd. on October 29 announced a proposal for new mobility in a sustainable zero emission society and an electric vehicle (EV) embodying its proposal, &amp;quot;NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan continues to envision new possibilities realized by EVs. One proposal is a sustainable, efficient and convenient mode of transportation focusing on the increase of elderly and single households, as well as the trend of driving short-distances or in smaller groups. NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT is our proposal to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;
	Four keywords outline the NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovative - New two-seater compact mobility for various needs and occasions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Easy - Size which enables anyone to drive and park easily&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safe - Maneuverability equivalent to motorbikes with greater safety&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clean - No emissions while driving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="imgLayout01"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT" src="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101101-02-01.jpg" /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		NISSAN New Mobility CONCEPT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;
	NISSAN New Mobility Concept is an user-friendly, ultra-compact 100% electric vehicle with no emissions which is expected to be utilized in various situations in everyday life. Nissan will study the use of this vehicle for a variety of services, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;#39;seamless mobility service&amp;#39;, a highly efficient and convenient public transportation service linking public transportation and EVs supported by IT,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;#39;2-mode EV car sharing&amp;#39;, where the vehicle is used as a private commuter vehicle in the mornings and evenings, and as a corporate car during business hours, and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		contributing to the revitalization of communities with improved mobility in both urban and tourist locations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="imgLayout03" summary="Layout"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;img alt="Seamless mobility service" height="95" src="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101101-02-02.jpg" width="180" /&gt;

					Seamless mobility service&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;img alt="2-mode EV car sharing" height="95" src="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101101-02-03.jpg" width="180" /&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					2-mode EV car sharing&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;
					Revitalization of communities&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Aiming to be a global leader in zero-emission mobility with Alliance partner Renault, Nissan will launch Nissan LEAF, the first 100 percent&amp;nbsp;electric, mass-marketed, zero-emission car in December 2010 in Japan and the United States, and in early 2011 in Europe. In addition to the development and production of EVs, Nissan is taking a comprehensive approach to promote sustainable mobility. This includes Nissan&amp;#39;s engagement with more than 80 zero-emission partnerships worldwide with countries, cities, organizations and other key stakeholders, the deployment of charging infrastructure, second-life use of lithium-ion batteries in EVs and the promotion of recycling parts used in vehicle production.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Abbott recognized for environmental initiatives in Illinois</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Abbott announced October 28 that it has received the annual Illinois Continuous Improvement Award for environmental excellence. It is the ninth time Abbott has been honored for its efforts to safeguard the environment and integrate sustainability initiatives at its corporate headquarters and throughout its operations in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Abbott&amp;#39;s efforts in Illinois are part of our broader commitment to safeguard the environment across all areas of our business and in all global communities in which we operate,&amp;quot; said Corlis Murray, vice president for global engineering services, Abbott. &amp;quot;We have set aggressive targets to achieve environmental results in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and waste reduction. We&amp;#39;re taking a holistic approach to our environmental impact, from sourcing of raw materials to the use of our products by consumers and health care professionals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Abbott was recognized for six projects aimed at implementing &amp;quot;green processes&amp;quot; and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at its manufacturing and research and development facilities in Lake County, Illinois. These initiatives included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Implementing changes to manufacturing processes to significantly reduce the amount of non-water-based materials used in production; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reducing electricity and steam usage in air handling systems and improving energy efficiency in manufacturing and research and development buildings, eliminating approximately 1.34 million pounds of CO2 emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Continuous Improvement Awards are part of the Illinois Governor&amp;#39;s Sustainability Awards program. The awards recognize businesses and organizations in the State of Illinois for significant achievements in protecting the environment through sustainable business practices. The award is administered by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC), a division of the Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability at the University of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Safeguarding the environment is an important part of Abbott&amp;#39;s mission to improve people&amp;#39;s health, and the company&amp;#39;s efforts to be a leader in global citizenship. Abbott has identified climate change, water usage and product stewardship as its key environmental priorities, and is taking innovative approaches across the company to reduce its environmental impact. This includes reducing Abbott&amp;#39;s use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and increasing its use of cleaner and renewable energy. The company is taking a comprehensive approach to water conservation throughout its operations, resulting in an annual savings of 1 billion gallons of water. Abbott also is implementing more than 40 sustainable packaging initiatives across the company, looking at ways to use lighter, more sustainable materials in package design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Abbott &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Abbott is a global, broad-based health care company devoted to the discovery, development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical products, including nutritionals, devices and diagnostics. The company employs nearly 90,000 people and markets its products in more than 130 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/V9VWJMUUpyU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Will the cost of electric cars come down? A Q&amp;A session with A123</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/how-far-will-your-ev-go-it-depends-how-fast-you-charge-it/" jquery1288179281256="8"&gt;Astonishing fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/drive-an-ev-slash-the-co2/" jquery1288179281256="9"&gt;reductions in CO2 pollution&lt;/a&gt; and the ability to &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-unveils-residential-wattstation-ev-charger/" jquery1288179281256="10"&gt;charge your battery at home&lt;/a&gt; are just a few of the benefits that electric vehicles offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, the only step left between us and a world filled with electric vehicles is actual adoption of EVs by drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Right now, EVs are expensive and recent consumer data shows that 69 percent of consumers consider price the most important factor in purchasing a vehicle. Most of them expect to pay less than $30,000 for an EV &amp;mdash; which presents a serious problem, given that the cheaper EVs &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/at-33k-nissan-leaf-to-be-one-of-cheapest-electric-cars-in-u-s/" jquery1288179281256="11"&gt;currently cost around $33,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 250px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/a123.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Good Connections:&lt;/span&gt; A123 was born out of the research labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Government officials, environmentalists, and industry leaders hope that as demand for EVs rises, economies of scale will reduce production costs enough to make them affordable for the average consumer. But critics say the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735804575536242934528502.html?KEYWORDS=A123+Systems" jquery1288179281256="12"&gt;EV industry faces technological barriers&lt;/a&gt; that will mean cost reductions may be at least ten years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Reports caught up with Andy Chu, a vice president at &lt;a href="http://www.a123systems.com/" jquery1288179281256="13"&gt;A123 Systems&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading manufacturers of electric car batteries. With a &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-boosts-battery-and-hybrid-bets/" jquery1288179281256="14"&gt;recent investment from GE&lt;/a&gt;, A123&amp;prime;s planned production facilities will be able to supply lithium ion batteries for 500,000 plug-in EVs a year by 2013. But the question remains as to whether EV costs will decrease quickly and substantially enough for consumers to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: The electric car&amp;rsquo;s battery accounts for almost half of the production costs, and can raise the sticker price thousands of dollars. What makes the battery so expensive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: It&amp;rsquo;s the cost of the equipment, the materials that go into the battery, labor, and the processing costs. And some costs related to testing. But it&amp;rsquo;s really dominated by materials, processing, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: Can any of these factors be reduced with economies of scale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: The battery separator uses a polymer material, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s when you make it into a specific form that it becomes expensive. Over time, as people improve the processing, it will become less and less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, electronics are already mass-produced commodities, and you can reduce the cost as you increase the production, and design better circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/An-A123-Systems-employee-ch.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Charged up:&lt;/span&gt; A123 Systems, seen above, is also developing smart grid applications, such as utility-scale energy storage,&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: That leaves labor and the raw materials. Specialized labor costs may well be fixed. But what about critics&amp;rsquo; focus on materials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: For the lithium ion battery, &amp;hellip; &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735804575536242934528502.html?KEYWORDS=A123+Systems" jquery1288179281256="15"&gt;nickel, cobalt, and manganese [have been cited]&lt;/a&gt; as the primary costs. And those are three of the higher cost items. When you look at laptops and cell phone batteries, they use those materials as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: So demand could keep the costs of those materials high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: In theory. But A123 uses different materials [in our batteries]. We use a &lt;a href="http://a123systems.com/#/news/news110" jquery1288179281256="16"&gt;patented nanophosphate technology&lt;/a&gt;. Nanophosphate is a form of lithium ion phosphate. And instead of [the very expensive] nickel, manganese, and cobalt, we use iron. And iron is obviously less expensive. Which gives you reason to believe that the iron-based battery will be less expensive in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: These aren&amp;rsquo;t the only raw materials in high demand, however&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: The cathode material is only a portion of the cost. There are other materials involved, such as copper. Those add to the cost. Still, industry expectation is for far more significant cost reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota, three partner firms start joint battery-to-battery recycling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Toyota Chemical Engineering Company Ltd. (Toyota Chemical Engineering), Sumitomo Metal Mining Company Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal Mining) and Primearth EV Energy Company Ltd. (PEVE) on October 27 announced the launch of the world&amp;#39;s first business to recycle nickel in used hybrid-vehicle nickel-metal-hydride batteries for use in new nickel-metal-hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Previously, nickel-metal-hydride batteries recovered by car dealers and vehicle dismantling businesses were subjected to reduction treatment, and scrap containing nickel was recycled as a raw material for stainless-steel manufacturing. &amp;nbsp;Now, with the development of high-precision nickel sorting and extraction technology, materials can be introduced directly into the nickel-refining process, thus achieving &amp;quot;battery-to-battery&amp;quot; recycling.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To carry out the business, TMC has established the Toyota HV Call Center to help recover the batteries, constructed advanced recycling facilities designed for mass production in cooperation with Toyota Chemical Engineering, and is receiving support from Sumitomo Metal Mining concerning the refining of nickel for use in batteries. &amp;nbsp;TMC is also receiving support from PEVE concerning quality assurance in the manufacture of hybrid-vehicle nickel-metal-hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition, making use of trucks on return trips from parts deliveries is planned to reduce environmental impact, including CO&lt;span class="small"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions during transport.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The establishment of this recycling system in Japan will accelerate the creation of a sustainable, recycling-based society, a priority measure for TMC, and is a showcase for recovery and recycling technologies as effective means of promoting and reinforcing recycling in response to global resource limitations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is currently investigating introducing this recycling system overseas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

	B: Reduction and sorting process (Toyota Chemical Engineering)&lt;br /&gt;
	C: Nickel refining process (Sumitomo Metal Mining)&lt;br /&gt;
	D: Battery manufacturing (PEVE)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Alcoa receives green power award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Alcoa was honored with the &lt;em&gt;Green Power: Turn It On! &lt;/em&gt;Award from Citizens for Pennsylvania&amp;#39;s Future (PennFuture) for its continued commitment to sustainability. Alcoa was recognized for using renewable, clean energy for 60 percent of its smelting operations, providing energy-efficient materials for green buildings, having an employee energy reduction program, and leading the industry in the recycling and reusing of aluminum beverage cans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PennFuture awards recognize individuals and organizations for their work in promoting the clean energy economy in Pennsylvania each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Alcoa was founded on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh in 1888 on the basis of developing an energy efficient way to produce aluminum. Our focus on energy efficiency continues. One of the best ways all of us can reduce energy usage is by recycling aluminum cans, because it takes 95 percent less energy to produce aluminum from recycled product than from bauxite ore,&amp;rdquo; said William J. O&amp;rsquo;Rourke, Alcoa vice president for sustainability and environment, health &amp;amp; safety. &amp;ldquo;I am pleased to accept this award on behalf of Alcoa employees around the world who save energy every day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PennFuture&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Green Power: Turn It On! c&lt;/em&gt;ampaign is a multifaceted, multiyear campaign aimed at building the renewable energy market in the state. PennFuture is a statewide public interest membership organization that works to create a just future where nature, communities and the economy thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/CWJ7cXKLFd8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Molson Coors recognized as leader in environmental stewardship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Molson Coors Brewing Company has been recognized in two recent reports for its sustainability efforts and environmental transparency. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2010 S&amp;amp;P 500 report recognizes global companies making an effort to tackle climate change. In the report, Molson Coors was included in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index, which is a key component of CDP&amp;rsquo;s annual S&amp;amp;P 500 Report, highlighting the companies within the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index that have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance in respect of climate change disclosure practices. Molson Coors is the only global brewer to be recognized in the family of Carbon Disclosure Leadership Indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index recognizes companies that demonstrate good internal data management practices for understanding greenhouse gas emissions, including energy use,&amp;rdquo; said Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project. &amp;ldquo;Companies that make this index have also demonstrated clear consideration of how climate change is and will impact their business. As companies&amp;rsquo; understanding of climate change issues grows, they are better placed to take positive action to manage and mitigate its risks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the CDP report, Newsweek released its 2010 Green Rankings and Molson Coors was ranked in the top 10 in the food and beverage sector at number seven and 160 overall out of the U.S. Top 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Molson Coors, we wholeheartedly support the efforts of both CDP and Newsweek to measure and report on companies&amp;rsquo; commitment to responsible environmental practices including carbon disclosure and sustainability. As a company whose products depend on the environment, Molson Coors has a vested interest in preserving and protecting our global resources,&amp;rdquo; said Bart Alexander, vice president, global alcohol policy and corporate responsibility for Molson Coors. &amp;ldquo;While we appreciate the recognition from the Carbon Disclosure Project and Newsweek, we know that we have a lot more to do and will continue to further improve on our practices and overall environmental stewardship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index, compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of CDP, provides an evaluation tool for institutional investors. In 2010, it comprises 53 constituents of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index based on analysis of the responses to CDP&amp;rsquo;s 2010 questionnaire which focused on greenhouse gas emissions, emissions reduction targets and risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Companies are scored on their climate change disclosure and high scores indicate good internal data management and understanding of climate change related issues affecting the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Newsweek ranking, the Green Score, is based on three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Environmental impact score: a comprehensive and standardized quantitative performance measurement that captures the total cost of all environmental impacts of a corporation&amp;rsquo;s global operations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Green policies score: an analytical assessment of a company&amp;rsquo;s environmental policies and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reputation score: based on an opinion survey of corporate social responsibility professionals, academics and other environmental experts who subscribe to CorporateRegister.com as well as CEOs and high ranking officials in all companies on the Newsweek 500 list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Molson Coors Brewing Company: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>2011 Green Car of the Year finalists revealed</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Green Car Journal announced October 21 its five finalists for the 2011 Green Car of the Year, including the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, 2011 Ford Fiesta, 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid and the 2011 Nissan LEAF. For the sixth consecutive year, this increasingly important award will be announced during a press conference at the LA Auto Show Press Days on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Green Car of the Year award is a program that honors environmental leadership in the automobile field and recognizes vehicles that become available to consumers during the award year. For the first time, the Green Car of the Year finalists include two primarily electric-drive vehicles in addition to two hybrids and a high mile-per-gallon, gasoline internal combustion engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These five 2011 Green Car of the Year finalists reflect an auto industry in transition,&amp;quot; said Ron Cogan, editor and publisher of Green Car Journal and editor of &lt;a href="http://www.greencar.com/"&gt;GreenCar.com&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t long ago when electric drive was a novelty. Now, it&amp;#39;s expected that auto manufacturers will include electric drive in some form among their model offerings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While four of the five Green Car of the Year nominees do incorporate electric drive, the Ford Fiesta nominee underscores that internal combustion continues to evolve in important ways. This hatchback achieves up to 40 EPA estimated highway fuel economy, running on conventional gasoline. Along with vehicles incorporating electric drive, a new generation of internal combustion gasoline and clean diesel models are expected to push efficiencies ever higher in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dozens of potential nominees weighed in during the selection process. Green Car Journal editors considered vehicles employing all fuels and technologies in the effort to raise the bar in environmental performance, including high efficiency gasoline internal combustion, advanced diesel, hybrids, electrics and vehicles capable of running on alternative fuels. In the Green Car of the Year program, nominees must stand out as exemplary models that forward environmental performance in meaningful and quantifiable ways. Market significance and &amp;quot;newness&amp;quot; are also factors. All nominees must be on sale by January 1 of the award year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jurors include leaders of the nation&amp;#39;s top environmental organizations, including Carl Pope, chairman of the Sierra Club; Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council; Jean-Michel Cousteau, president of Ocean Futures Society and Matt Petersen, president of Global Green USA. Also, Jay Leno, noted auto enthusiast and host of the &amp;quot;Tonight Show,&amp;quot; as well as automotive icon Carroll Shelby join Green Car Journal editors in rounding out the 2011 jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/QWr5ozBy5WQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Raytheon heralded as one of America's green companies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Raytheon Company has been ranked as the 75th greenest company in America in the second annual &lt;a href="http://greenrankings.newsweek.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Newsweek Green Rankings&lt;/a&gt;. The magazine evaluated the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The No. 75 ranking in 2010 represents a significant leap for Raytheon, which last year came in at No. 208. Raytheon also finished in the No. 3 spot within the Transportation and Aerospace sector, ahead of Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and behind only United Technologies and UPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Green Rankings were derived from three categories: Environmental Impact, Green Policies and Reputation, which were weighted at 45 percent, 45 percent and 10 percent respectively. Hundreds of metrics were considered, including those measuring greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water usage and pollution performance. After researching its own environmental data, Newsweek allowed each company to review the data for accuracy and furnish any additional pertinent information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improvement in Raytheon&amp;rsquo;s ranking is due in part to the company&amp;rsquo;s Raytheon Sustainability program, launched in 2009. The program seeks to find ways to protect our environment and conserve natural resources by engaging our employees, customers, suppliers and communities. It&amp;rsquo;s our commitment to future generations.

            <title>Dow improves energy efficiency of Texas City operations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Ask the Energy Expert&lt;/em&gt;is an ongoing column with the intent of providing information and solutions for industry&amp;rsquo;s most pressing questions. This issue&amp;rsquo;s Energy Expert is Joe Almaguer, the global energy-efficiency leader at Dow Chemical in Midland, Mich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Dear Energy Expert:&lt;br /&gt;
	Your company is testing the elements of the Superior Energy Performance energy management certification program. What challenges or benefits have you experienced by implementing a new energy management standard into your existing corporate energy management system?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Dow Chemical Company is a provider of plastics, chemicals and agricultural products. Dow connects chemistry and innovation with the principles of sustainability to help address many of the world&amp;rsquo;s most challenging problems. The company&amp;rsquo;s diversified industry-leading portfolio of specialty chemical, advanced materials, agrosciences and plastics businesses delivers a wide range of technology-based products and solutions to customers. Dow&amp;rsquo;s products have presence in approximately 160 countries and in high-growth sectors, such as electronics, water, energy, and coatings. In 2009, Dow had annual sales of $45 billion and employed approximately 52,000 people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Dow has long championed energy efficiency and has institutionalized a corporate energy management system into its operations. The company has achieved remarkable success, improving its energy efficiency 38 percent since 1990, corporate-wide. As a founding and active member of the U.S. Council for Energy-Efficient Manufacturing &amp;ndash; a group charged with developing Superior Energy Performance (SEP), a forthcoming American National Standards Institute-accredited energy management certification program &amp;ndash; it naturally followed that Dow would join in piloting the standards of the program (the next and current phase of the SEP project). Dow chose its Texas City, Texas, operations to participate &amp;ndash; an integrated site with numerous systems tied together, representing approximately $50 million in annual energy costs. This balanced well for SEP, as some of the other pilots are smaller projects, running at about $10 million in annual costs. For Dow, integrating a new &amp;ndash; but not wholly different &amp;ndash; energy management standard has been the main adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating SEP standards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In general, a crucial component to successfully implementing a new energy management system is strong leadership commitment. Leadership support is imperative to a company&amp;rsquo;s success, as they set the tone for resources, programs, and adopting SEP. One of the challenges we experienced at the Texas City plant was not lack of leadership support, but that the implementation occurred during a time of significant organizational change. However, having a seasoned energy champion on-site helped us maintain momentum and focus during the critical implementation phase. Although Dow has long recognized the importance and benefits of energy efficiency and has operated under a corporate energy management system for many years, our Texas City plant found new benefits in adopting the specific elements of the SEP program. Through application of the standard requirements (MSE 2000), SEP has given us a more complete approach, down to our plant-level operations. It has helped us translate our corporate requirements into site-specific best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SEP offers flexibility in its implementation to accommodate plants that have a mature program in place and have harvested most of the available energy-saving opportunities, as well as those who may be starting the journey or still have ample improvement opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Texas City, we felt that the SEP performance improvement approach would enhance the energy efficiency initiatives already in place. We implemented two projects during the SEP implementation effort. The first project was actually initiated prior to SEP implementation, but was identified as having energy efficiency benefits as well. The project installed feed pre-heat on a distillation column utilizing the hot bottoms stream from another distillation column. The original intent of the project was to address a production bottleneck. By applying SEP&amp;rsquo;s approach to the process, we were able to identify the energy efficiency improvements. This project met Dow&amp;rsquo;s internal rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second project involved our isopropanol processes. A recent upgrade of the process control system presented the opportunity to implement advanced controls to the process. The SEP significant energy user concept helped identify the controls that would have the biggest impact on energy efficiency. We identified an opportunity to optimize the amount of sparged steam into the hydrolysis process. We executed a six sigma project and were able to find the optimal sparge steam ratio. A benefit of SEP is that it is not prescriptive or overly burdensome, and we&amp;rsquo;ve applied it to our unique needs. It didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily take away from our existing program, because anyone can benefit from SEP&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive, best practices approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Projects were also implemented in the site utilities area. The SEP concept of establishing a baseline helped identify an opportunity to improve the efficiency of a steam turbine generator. Over time, steam turbine efficiencies degrade over extended run times. Monitoring steam turbine efficiency versus baseline data helped justify an overhaul of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A similar review of boiler data revealed a subtle decline in boiler efficiency. A simple maintenance project to wash the economizer tubes during the next scheduled outage resulted in measureable improvement in boiler efficiency. SEP has been a flexible, results-driven approach that has worked well for scheduled efficiency upgrades, but has also worked for conditions-based upgrades as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We believe SEP will have a positive response with industry. It has worked well in Texas City, helping us improve the way in which we manage the energy performance. Dow has a long history of integrating energy management into its corporate culture, but anyone can realize benefits from implementing SEP. When the ISO50001 standard is finalized, we will only have to make minor tweaks to our system. Companies that participate in SEP are provided a road map for achieving continual improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE examines real state of electric vehicles in a billion-car world</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With the &lt;a href="http://blogs.motortrend.com/6719595/green/127-mpg-this-volt-story-must-be-told/index.html#ixzz12uUKK9q1" jquery1287668288811="8"&gt;Chevy Volt hitting the market soon&lt;/a&gt;, the buzz on electric vehicles (&amp;ldquo;EVs&amp;rdquo;) is reaching a media fever pitch. Environmental and energy blogs are understandably excited and the business press is kicking the tires to see if an EV world could really be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704654004575517891616896222.html?mod=wsj_share_twitter" jquery1287668288811="9"&gt;biggest hammer used against EVs&lt;/a&gt; is the argument over costs &amp;ndash; specifically, will it be prohibitively expensive to build the cars, charging stations, and make the power grid upgrades needed. But even the major criticisms have another side, and for every skeptic, there&amp;rsquo;s a pumped-up EV advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In their story, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/anthony/2010/10/innovation_lessons_from_electr.html" jquery1287668288811="10"&gt;Innovation Lessons From Electric Cars&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; asks, what do innovators do when no one &amp;ldquo;knows for sure what customers will do with an innovation because they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before? The quickest approach is to look at what customers currently do, or look at historical case studies that bear some similarity to your idea. This may provide a general sense of what might happen, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken too seriously. After all, the whole point of an innovation is to change something in a meaningful enough way to render past patterns meaningless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;

			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/volt.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Road rave:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.motortrend.com/6719595/green/127-mpg-this-volt-story-must-be-told/index.html#ixzz12uUKK9q1" jquery1287668288811="11"&gt;MotorTrend&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; took on EV critics in the media, writing: &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m so geeked on the Chevy Volt and why you should be, too. In normal, everyday driving we got 127 miles per gallon (fine, 126.7 mpg). Which is pretty amazing. Broken down, over the course of 299 miles on Los Angeles highways, byways and freeways, the Volt burned 2.36 gallons of gasoline (fine, 2.359 gallons &amp;mdash; we rounded up). Most other cars use up a tank of gas going 299 miles. The Volt, to reiterate, used 2.36 gallons over 299 miles. That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;freaking&lt;/em&gt; amazing!&amp;rdquo; Photo: GM.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Likewise, the &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/10/19/two-things-about-electric-cars-the-wall-street-journal-missed/" jquery1287668288811="12"&gt;blog VentureBeat.com points out that critics&lt;/a&gt; who say the EV market will be very small &amp;mdash; despite about 20 models being introduced by a range of carmakers &amp;mdash; are missing how big the numbers are. Most industry analysts expect pure EVs to represent about 2 percent of global production by 2020 &amp;mdash; which will be a substantial number as the world is expected to have 1 billion cars on the road: &amp;ldquo;Even 1 percent of the global market in 2020 might represent 1 million electric cars. And, in that same year, those same analysts expect &lt;a href="http://sportscarmonitor.com/category/hybrid,new" jquery1287668288811="13"&gt;hybrids&lt;/a&gt; to be more than 10 percent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As to the argument that consumers won&amp;rsquo;t buy EVs because of &amp;ldquo;range anxiety&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; the fear that an EV will run out of batteries and leave them stranded &amp;mdash; VentureBeat points out that &amp;ldquo;the average U.S household has more than 2 cars, and no one will make all three battery electrics with limited range. There will likely always be one car with gasoline power for long trips or emergencies. Day to day, families will plan around an EV&amp;rsquo;s range just as they now plan around their cars&amp;rsquo; carrying capacity and number of seats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And as HBR added about the skeptical headlines of late: &amp;ldquo;Many great innovators had serious doubts cast on their ultimately successful ideas.&amp;rdquo; Thomas Edison might surely have a d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu moment if he were here today.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Butterball selects EPS to increase energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	EPS Corp on October 20 announced that Butterball, LLC, the largest producer of turkey products in the United States, has selected EPS&amp;rsquo; xChange Point real-time energy management and carbon reduction solution as a technology enabler to achieve its energy efficiency and sustainability goals. xChange Point will initially be deployed at Butterball&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing facility in Mt. Olive, N.C., to analyze current energy consumption and carbon emissions, identify areas for the greatest improvement, and design a strategy to increase overall plant energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the key elements in Butterball&amp;rsquo;s Corporate Social Responsibility directive, &amp;ldquo;sustainability&amp;rdquo; is a top priority for the corporation. For that reason, Butterball wanted to add an energy intelligence system that would allow the company to monitor and reduce their energy use and carbon emissions and achieve their overall sustainability targets. Butterball selected EPS Corp because of the company&amp;rsquo;s expertise in industrial energy efficiency and the breadth of its real-time xChange Point energy management solution, backed by a team of energy analysts and engineers to recommend and implement the most effective sustainability initiatives in concert with Butterball&amp;rsquo;s internal team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Butterball is dedicated to being a good steward of the environment,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Valesko, vice president of engineering for Butterball LLC. &amp;ldquo;The EPS system provides our company with real-time measurements for obtaining our sustainability goals, resulting in cost reductions for the facilities as well as reinforcing our commitment to the environmental community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EPS&amp;rsquo; xChange Point system is deployed by multiple Fortune 1000 manufacturing companies to use real- time, enterprise-wide data, together with recommendations by EPS experts, to reduce energy and water use and carbon emissions. This software as a service solution provides an enterprise-wide view of important sustainability and production metrics that can help reduce costs while improving sustainability at facilities across the enterprise &amp;ndash; making it a powerful solution for leading global companies such as Butterball to understand their energy, water, and carbon profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/MEsDIpCRl5c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The top five GE technologies that turn waste into energy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Here is a list of the top five GE technologies that turn waste into energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1. The Nuclear Reactor That Eats Its Own Waste &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/prism_both_cutaway.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/an-update-on-the-nuclear-reactor-that-eats-its-own-waste/"&gt;GE&amp;rsquo;s Hitachi Advanced Recycling Center&lt;/a&gt; burns nuclear waste (even weapons-grade plutonium), and emits zero CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s the secret: The system uses sodium to control the nuclear reaction, instead of high-pressure water. Sodium-cooling allows the reactor to &amp;ldquo;burn&amp;rdquo; the leftover energy in used fuel. When used fuel is removed from a traditional water-cooled reactor, 95 percent of its potential energy is still untapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2. The Jenbacher Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/china_jenbacher.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ges-new-michigan-tech-center-revs-up-with-landfill-gas/" jquery1287602047168="8"&gt;The Jenbacher could be called the alchemist of energy&lt;/a&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a gas-fueled reciprocating engine that can run on natural gas, biogas, landfill gas, coal mine gas, sewage gas, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jenbachers are used by a broad range of commercial, industrial, and municipal customers to generate power, heat, and cooling. Europe currently has more than 1,100 engines running on biogas, and they&amp;rsquo;re being used to convert coal mine gas to electricity in Australia and Ukraine. (&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-powers-chinas-largest-chicken-waste-biogas-plant/" jquery1287602047168="9"&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s largest chicken waste biogas plant&lt;/a&gt; is seen above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3. The Hybrid Locomotive &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="3" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="3"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="3"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="3" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/eco-locomotive.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.ecomagination.com/technologies/evolution-hybrid-locomotive/" jquery1287602047168="10"&gt;The Evolution Hybrid Locomotive&lt;/a&gt; can capture and store braking energy for later use. Every time the conductor hits the brakes, ordinarily wasted braking energy goes to fueling the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

	The energy that&amp;rsquo;s wasted in braking a 207-ton locomotive during the course of one year is enough to power over 8,900 average U.S. households for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-enters-1b-waste-heat-recovery-sector-with-calnetix-acquisition/" jquery1287602047168="11"&gt;The technology GE just acquired from Calnetix&lt;/a&gt; recovers heat given off by industrial processes and uses it to produce electricity. It&amp;rsquo;s a fast-growing trend in the global power industry, and for good reason: it can dramatically improve operating efficiency while lowering a carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How it works: heat is captured in an evaporator that boils the working fluid, producing vapor. The vapor expands, spinning a turbine, which drives a generator and produces electricity. The vapor is then cooled back to a liquid and pumped back to the evaporator to repeat the process.&lt;/p&gt;

GE&amp;rsquo;s TrueSense technology can slash this fresh water use by up to 20% and save $400,000 annually &amp;mdash; with part of the system using an iPad-sized monitoring system and a set of diagnostic tools. By industries using less water in the first place, there&amp;rsquo;s more freshwater available for the drinking water that energizes you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/K9Qt7vos1zA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Honda issues 2010 North American Environmental Report</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda released its sixth annual report on the company&amp;#39;s environmental footprint in North America, and efforts being made to minimize the environmental impact of Honda&amp;#39;s operations in the region. The report also includes a detailed review of the various technology approaches that Honda is taking in its efforts to address the issue of global climate change, perhaps the most serious and far-reaching environmental issue facing society today. The 2010 North American Environmental Report, published in electronic format only, can be &lt;a href="http://corporate.honda.com/environment/2010-report/"&gt;viewed and downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Despite the severe business conditions of the past year, Honda remains strongly committed to innovation and to the continued development of new products and technologies that minimize our environmental footprint and that help address society&amp;#39;s most pressing environmental concerns,&amp;quot; said Tetsuo Iwamura, chief operating officer of Honda&amp;#39;s North American Regional Operation. &amp;quot;Thanks to the efforts of Honda associates at all levels and in all areas of our operations, we continue to make significant progress in improving energy efficiency, reducing waste, and eliminating potentially harmful substances from our products, production operations and sales activities in North America. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Highlights of the 2010 report include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		American Honda&amp;#39;s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) for model year 2009 (MY2009) rose 1 mpg to 31.3 mpg, a 3.3 percent increase from MY2008 and a 7.2 percent rise from MY2005, outpacing the company&amp;#39;s voluntary goal (set in May 2006) to achieve a 5 percent increase over MY2005 CAFE levels by MY2010.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste to landfills from manufacturing activity was reduced 87 percent from the FY2001 baseline and 65 percent from the previous fiscal year, with eight North American plants achieving zero waste to landfill, as Honda moved closer to its goal of achieving zero waste to landfill for all 14 of its plants in the region by April 1, 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Total energy used in manufacturing was reduced 8 percent from the previous fiscal year, while energy use per automobile produced rose 2.4 percent as a result of lower production volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average CO2 emissions per automobile produced rose only 1 percent despite an 8 percent decrease in the volume of automobile production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Intelligent&amp;quot; paint booth technology was implemented on all automobile paint lines in North America, reducing energy used in auto body painting by as much as 25 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Emissions of volatile organic compounds from auto body painting were reduced 9.8 percent from FY2008 levels to 13.8 grams per square meter, exceeding Honda&amp;#39;s target of 20 grams per square meter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Two new on-site parts consolidation centers &amp;ndash; at the Marysville, Ohio, auto plant and Timmonsville, S.C., all-terrain vehicle (ATV) plant &amp;ndash; are estimated to reduce CO2 emissions from supplier parts shipments by nearly 1,300 metric tons annually.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Honda&amp;#39;s North American Purchasing Division launched a Supply Chain Sustainability Initiative to promote actions aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from supplier activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A new port facility in Richmond, Calif., Honda&amp;#39;s third west coast port facility, is expected to reduce truck travel by 2.7 million miles annually, cutting CO2 emissions from product distribution by an estimated 4,500 metric tons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 North American Environmental Report covers the company&amp;#39;s operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 (FY2010) and utilizes a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to report on the environmental impact of Honda&amp;#39;s R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing and sales activities in the North America region, encompassing the United States, Canada and Mexico. The report looks at the environmental performance of the company&amp;#39;s automobile, powersports, and power equipment products, its 14 major manufacturing plants operating in North America in FY2010, and the corporate activities of 15 Honda group companies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/nJOe2QVTqmo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF awarded LEED green building certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF USA Inc. announced October 18 at a special ceremony attended by Pennsylvania Governor Edward G. Rendell and approximately 500 employees and distinguished guests, that it has been awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED&lt;strong&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/strong&gt;) Platinum certification, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other dignitaries attending today&amp;#39;s event included U.S. Rep. Allyson Y. Schwartz, D-Pa.; Pa. Rep. Robert W. Godshall and Pa. Senator Bob Mensch. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF USA is the first commercial building in Pennsylvania to achieve Platinum level certification under LEED for Commercial Interiors &amp;mdash; and one of only 60 worldwide. LEED is the nation&amp;#39;s preeminent program for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;SKF USA&amp;#39;s extraordinary efforts to achieve LEED Platinum certification are helping to lay the groundwork for a cleaner, healthier future for all Pennsylvanians,&amp;quot; said Governor Rendell. &amp;quot;Making buildings greener is incredibly important. By using resources more efficiently, these buildings reduce operating costs and make a sizeable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. So green buildings like this one contribute to &amp;#39;greener&amp;#39; bottom lines for companies and a healthier environment for everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Governor added that the commonwealth was making an investment in the new facility to help it further reduce its environmental footprint. In December 2009, the Commonwealth Financing Authority approved a $346,000 Solar Energy Program Grant that will help SKF USA build a new, $2 million rooftop solar panel project that is scheduled to be completed in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Poul Jeppesen, president and chief executive officer of SKF USA, thanked the governor. In separate remarks, he discussed the significance of the October 18 events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This celebration is the culmination of an 18-month-long, $23 million redevelopment project, during which our team worked with local partners and suppliers to invest more than $1 million in sustainable strategies for energy, lighting, water and material usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Congresswoman Schwartz, &amp;quot;The building we celebrate today is an impressive model of green infrastructure. Green infrastructure is a key to a more sustainable, livable environment, and I am proud that this award winning building is located right here in my district.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Janet Milkman, executive director of the Delaware Valley Green Building Council, detailed a few of the many green design and construction features included in the 117,000-square-foot headquarters facility, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An extensive geothermal heating/HVAC system, consisting of 112 500-foot deep wells that use the Earth&amp;#39;s constant temperature to control the climate of the building, saving more than 30 percent on heating and cooling costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Low-emitting Greenguard quality refurbished furniture, the first of its kind to be extensively tested for potentially harmful emissions under LEED guidelines at the new, state-of-the-art American Furniture Manufacturers Association Testing Facility&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Daylight harvesting combined with high efficiency lighting that continues to save 30-40 percent in lighting energy consumption over traditional lighting systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Forest Stewardship Council-certified flooring and doors, which help support responsible forestry practices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ninety percent of all furniture equipment in the Lansdale facility is Energy Star-rated office equipment, such as our Energy Star fluorescent lights that use 75 percent less energy than normal incandescent fixtures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water-efficient fixtures that consume 44 percent less water than conventional fixtures, saving an estimated 278,000 gallons per year&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proactive construction waste management program that diverted 93% of waste materials away from landfills and over 20% was spent on recycled materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the ceremony, Jeppesen also recognized the key firms who partnered with SKF USA in the redevelopment project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Re:Vision Architecture, LEED architect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		D2 Solutions, interior designer and LEED consultant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NAI Geis Realty, broker and construction consultant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		hpeGroup, LLC, design engineers (mechanical, electrical and plumbing)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Philadelphia Suburban Development Corporation, developer and landlord&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Premier Office Solutions, furniture supplier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SKF is a leading global supplier of bearings, seals, mechatronics, lubrication systems and services which include technical support, maintenance and reliability services, engineering consulting and training. SKF is represented in more than 130 countries and has 15,000 distributor locations worldwide.

            <title>Ford, Dominion Virginia Power team to prepare state for electric vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company and Dominion Virginia Power on October 18 announced they are coordinating efforts to help prepare Virginia for the operation of electric vehicles. Ford and Dominion will work together to develop consumer outreach and education programs on electric vehicles as well as share information on charging needs and requirements to ensure the electrical grid can support the necessary demand. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over the next two years, Ford plans on bringing five new electrified vehicles to market including the Transit Connect Electric later this year and the Focus battery electric in late 2011,&amp;rdquo; said Nancy Gioia, global director of Electrification, Ford Motor Company. &amp;ldquo;We know there is an incredible excitement for electric vehicles in Virginia and across the country. To support the rollout and acceptance of these vehicles, it is crucial to work with local utilities, like Dominion, to make sure the necessary infrastructure is ready.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Cooperation between Ford and Dominion also involves working with the state and local governments on the most efficient ways to bring EVs to the state of Virginia. Government support for infrastructure and an easy charging station permitting process are considered to be two key elements to electric vehicle acceptance in Virginia and across the country.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Dominion Virginia Power is committed to ensuring electric vehicles flourish in the state of Virginia,&amp;rdquo; said Ken Barker, vice president, Customer Solutions &amp;amp; Energy Conservation, Dominion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Our reliable electric system, along with responsible rates, will be key factors in the growth and adoption of electric vehicles among our customers.&amp;nbsp;Electric vehicles will be an exciting part of our future at Dominion Virginia Power and we are ready for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The collaboration between Ford and Dominion was announced during Ford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Charging into the Future Electric Vehicle Tour.&amp;rdquo; The 14-city tour, which kicked off at Portland State University in Portland, Ore., in August, promotes Ford&amp;rsquo;s electric vehicle strategy and educates consumers about what to expect from electrified automobiles and what is needed from the public and private sector to support this new technology.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Over the next two years, Ford will introduce five electrified vehicles. Later this year, Ford and its partner Azure Dynamics will introduce the Transit Connect Electric small commercial van.&amp;nbsp;The Ford Focus Electric passenger car will be available in late 2011, followed by introductions of two third generation lithium-ion battery hybrids and a plug-in hybrid in 2012.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	These vehicles will achieve breakthrough efficiency; some, like the pure battery electric vehicles Ford Transit Connect Electric and Focus Electric, will use no gasoline at all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Electrification is an important piece of Ford&amp;rsquo;s overall product sustainability strategy that includes a range of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel technologies such as EcoBoost&lt;sup&gt;&amp;trade;&lt;/sup&gt; engines, six-speed transmissions, power-assisted steering, aerodynamic improvements and light-weighting materials. Ford&amp;rsquo;s electrification strategy also leverages the most fuel-efficient powertrains, the most technically competent hybrids and global vehicle platforms to develop affordable choices for consumers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/energy_management/~4/msyNiPeFGqQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
