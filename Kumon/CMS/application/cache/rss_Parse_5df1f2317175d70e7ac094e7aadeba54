            <title>5 Steps to Unleash Innovation and Improve Work Culture </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/14/f0880526-7ad7-4735-b52e-cb2498f9f709_work-culture2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Getting employees to contribute more to your organization while simultaneously establishing stronger talent retention must cost a pretty penny, right? Not really, according to corporate coach Maxine Attong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t necessarily need to add expensive new ingredients to the stew; you just have to know how to use your ingredients better,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;A talented chef &amp;mdash; or in this case, a corporate or organizational leader &amp;mdash; knows how to let an ingredient speak for itself, perhaps with just a touch of seasoning or guidance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is this guidance &amp;ndash; competition or incentives such as bonuses? Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Most employees want to have more input,&amp;quot; says Attong, a certified facilitator and author of &lt;em&gt;Lead Your Team to Win: Achieve Optimal Performance by Providing a Safe Space for Employees&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;However, personal issues, fear of being laughed at or anxiety of not getting credit can stymie contributions from a leader&amp;#39;s staff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a leader can engender a real sense of trust, the organization will benefit both from the individual and the team&amp;#39;s ingenuity. A reliable way of establishing a trusting climate is to make team members feel safe, says Attong, who offers five steps for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Share Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With openness, encourage interaction by having team members and leaders enforce the rules and monitor the use of common space. When members break the rules, the team discusses the problems and decides on the sanctions and steps necessary to assist the member in following the rules next time. Speakers are discouraged from using the word &amp;quot;you.&amp;quot; Instead, they use &amp;quot;I.&amp;quot; This simple, yet effective practice encourages personal culpability and discourages blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Teams need to consistently follow the agreed upon rules, as they set the boundaries and the tone for relationships. Following the rules makes the behavior in the space predictable, which limits uncertainty and increases feelings of safety. Consistent application of the rules helps the team to increase trust, as behavior becomes prescriptive and members know more or less what will happen in the room and how they will be treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Judgment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The members must feel that they are not being judged. If someone says that an idea is bad, the speaker will shut down and feel embarrassed. In the future, that speaker will hesitate to give ideas, since he feels his ideas may not be good enough for the team. Less confident team members may refrain from presenting ideas if they are uncertain of the quality of the ideas. However, many ideas that may seem strange or unorthodox at first can wind up being some of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Good Intentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all team members are effective communicators, so it may be difficult for some people to frame and cogently express their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I assume all team members have good intentions and want a positive outcome,&amp;quot; Attong says. &amp;quot;Even though what I am hearing may be contrary to that assumption, I hold onto the thought so that I am able to fully understand what the member is saying before I react.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When listening this way, the leader delays having a reaction and has time to assess the situation before responding. When the leader has emotionally detached from the situation, he can then ask questions to clarify the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Norming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By this point, team members seem to embrace each other, and there is a spirit of togetherness. Do not be fooled by this. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that your team has normed &amp;mdash; that each team member makes decisions that advance the goals of the team. It means that the safe space concept has allowed them to see each other in a more neutral light and accept each other&amp;#39;s strengths and weaknesses. While the space may act as an accelerator or catalyst for the team to norm, it is not magic. It does not mean that whatever problems existed within the team before have miraculously disappeared. The leader still needs to pay attention and check the team temperature. Regular team meetings and team-building sessions should still be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Strategies for Managing the Wave of Retiring Workers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/7/22/62fe1062-e99d-49de-8d8c-9dd51d33095f_retire.jpeg" style="width: 297px; height: 346px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Senior leaders across a broad array of industries continue to highlight retirements, turnover and succession planning as key issues confronting their organizations. Much has been written and reported on the impending retirement wave of baby boomer workers as one of those areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As new generations enter the workforce and older generations remain at work longer, employers must evolve to meet new employee needs. Most solutions involve recruiting tactics for attracting new, younger talent to industry ranks through collaboration with local colleges and technical schools, but what about proactively managing the actual turnover in the workplace? What&amp;#39;s the broader plan for transferring the &amp;ldquo;tribal knowledge&amp;rdquo; of departing workers to their replacements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two challenges a turnover strategy must address. The first involves the sheer magnitude of baby boomer retirements underway and on the horizon. Approximately 10,000 baby boomers are retiring every day. At many companies, more than 50 percent of the workforce will be retiring in the next three to five years. Most of these personnel are in key management and supervisory positions with extensive tenure, tribal knowledge and the secrets or tricks to keeping the workplace on pace. How will their knowledge make it to their replacements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second challenge involves the next generation of workers and their perspectives on employment and tenure. Demographic and trend studies show that the future will bring fewer loyal workers who dedicate their entire careers to a single workplace. Portable 401(k)s, the extinction of pensions and other &amp;ldquo;golden handcuff&amp;rdquo; benefits are among the many factors influencing career mobility. Younger workers are significantly more connected with national and international business, job opportunities and trends. Whereas 10 years ago a baby boomer may have been aware of two or three alternative job opportunities within a 100-mile radius, today&amp;#39;s generation X or Y worker is likely aware of hundreds of national or global opportunities for which he or she may be qualified. Skilled young production and manufacturing industry workers are in high demand, so the likelihood of more frequent job-swapping is real. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generations X and Y made up more than 60 percent of the workforce in 2012, and that number will continue to rise. Job tenure fell from 9.2 years in 1983 to less than one-half that (4.1 years) in 2008, and the recent recession likely cut that number further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A higher cycle of turnover is the new reality. More than 90 percent of millennials (persons born between 1977 and 1998) expect to stay in a job for less than three years. How will your company manage the turnover of key positions every few years as opposed to every decade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations must understand the dynamics of near and long-term turnover, including how younger generations of workers will impact how you recruit, train and operate; the tactics for capturing knowledge from workers approaching retirement before they leave; and how to utilize enterprise asset management (EAM) and a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to sustain best practices despite higher turnover rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Dynamics of Near and Long-term Turnover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prepare for these changes in the workforce, companies must first consider their aging workforce and focus on how to capture the tribal knowledge that these workers possess. They must also look at millennials. How do they fit into the workplace? How can you engage them and what are they seeking to attain job satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations need to assess their company culture. Culture is sustained by structures, systems and style of leadership. It is &amp;ldquo;the way we do things around here,&amp;rdquo; and is taught to the newcomers. Edgar Schein, author of &lt;em&gt;Organizational Culture and Leadership,&lt;/em&gt; defines culture as &amp;ldquo;a pattern of shared assumptions and behaviors that an organization learned as it solved its problems and that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think and feel in relation to those problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture is a product of how you have learned to manage problems. Structures refer to how you divide the work, such as through organizational charts and job descriptions. Systems refer to how you coordinate the work, including processes, measures, rewards and contracts. Style of leadership addresses how you engage and motivate the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to better engage the next generation of workers, you must eliminate some of the rigid constraints that past organizational structures may have created. The following chart offers a contrasting perspective on the differences between the generation X and millennial workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/magazine_images/201502/Stratagies_Retiring_Workers.png" style="width: 500px; height: 564px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Source: The Learning Caf&amp;eacute; and American Demographics Enterprising Museum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Impact of Younger Generations of Workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An AARP publication, &lt;em&gt;Leading a Multigenerational Workforce,&lt;/em&gt; offers suggestions to recruit and retain workers in the millennial generation. In terms of recruitment, it helps to have an outstanding employee from the millennial generation talk to the candidate. Millennials look for organizations that provide flexibility to allow them to pursue their many outside interests. They like to get involved in meaningful volunteer efforts and are community-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Millennials are financially savvy and have the capability to access and share information quickly. This is the most technologically and globally aware generation. Pair them with older mentors. On surveys, millennials say they relate best to the baby boomer and World War II generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How can you operate your organization with a workforce of millennials where high turnover rates are inevitable? For example, imagine an enterprise that has more than 250 employees with an average age of less than 22 who operate and maintain sophisticated mechanical, electrical and cutting-edge technology systems in unusually harsh climates and around-the-clock shifts. The operating requirements demand no less than 100-percent reliability for periods often exceeding six months. Now consider that this unusually complex operational facility actually turns over its entire workforce, including the president and senior management team, every three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The operation described above does exist and is typical of a U.S. Navy warship or submarine. How does a Navy ship&amp;#39;s commanding officer manage constant turnover while successfully operating and maintaining such a complex organization? The answer is in the ship&amp;#39;s operating culture, which allows the crew to not only survive but continuously improve in an environment of ongoing personnel turnover. An operating culture can be defined as the collective behavioral norms and expectations that govern the way people approach their work and interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Capturing Knowledge from Workers Before They Leave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping with the previous example, you likely would see work being conducted on a Navy ship with checklists or standard operating procedure manuals, formal safety procedures and a buddy system that ensures quality control and safety. Training, both formal and on the job, is continuous. Senior supervisors and officers are visible and supportive. Very little seat-of-the-pants work is performed despite the nature of the unique maintenance, operations and training challenges the crew confronts daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within any organization, the most effective method for establishing a repeatable and more easily adopted operating culture is to develop standard best-practice business, operations, and maintenance processes and procedures. It is critical to ensure that high expectations and associated accountability standards are set for procedural compliance and to continuously improve these processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example at a power generation facility might be the synchronization of electrical turbine generators. Is this accomplished by each shift and supervisor with a standardized set of procedures and checklists or is it done a little differently each time based on the personalized styles of those in charge? How would it be accomplished next month if those supervisors or technicians were no longer with the organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Evolving from a culture of tribal knowledge and informal operating practices to one of standardized process adherence, practices and procedures involves commitment and accountability from the leadership team. Sharing knowledge, documenting inherent best practices and eliminating the &amp;ldquo;knowledge is job security&amp;rdquo; mentality will require time and significant behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do your root cause failure analysis efforts often result in &amp;ldquo;human error&amp;rdquo; as a common cause? Have you observed personnel completing a task such as swapping out a duplex strainer on a pumping system lately? Are they following a standardized process or procedure that is written down? Are they completing a checklist and confirming or quality-checking their work? If not, how might you go about introducing those concepts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following initiatives can be useful in creating more standardized work practices and reducing the damaging effects of high turnover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify critical work and procedures that are currently being accomplished with tribal knowledge or without the benefit of documented standard operating procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Capture knowledge and data for this critical work from existing employees and transform that knowledge into institutionalized training programs and documented procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish training programs that drive accountability and ensure all employees have the skills, competency and knowledge to perform the assigned tasks as well as the ability to record data from those tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop continuously evolving standard operating procedures that are followed via checklists and supervisory oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Utilize an enterprise asset management system that allows managers to make decisions and plans based on factual information, captured data and trends rather than gut feel or the experience of employees who may no longer be around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It takes time to shift from a culture of &amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s the way we&amp;#39;ve always done it,&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;#39;s precisely how and why we do it this way.&amp;rdquo; This will require a commitment from leadership to be engaged and visible with workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s likely your organization has accomplished this within other elements of your business. Safety and human resource departments tend to have evolved their standardization of procedures and processes. Now is the time to initiate the change and activities necessary to bring this consistency and standardization to your everyday operating practices on the plant floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The operating culture of a U.S. Navy warship is an impressive vision for leaders to model because it serves as a realistic example of how an organization can be efficient and effective in managing workforce turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A survey of corporate boards once defined the No. 1 reason senior executives are terminated as &amp;ldquo;the inability to affect change within their organizations.&amp;rdquo; Likewise, changing the operating culture within your organization to ensure the transitions that take place when personnel leave will be a critical factor in meeting goals and objectives through this coming wave of retirements and into the next generation of more frequent employee turnover. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Utilizing an EAM/CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many organizations, information is compartmentalized by functional group (finance, procurement, etc.) and fragmented into pre-programmed reports or analysis formats. As a result, it is difficult, if not impossible, to quickly and accurately measure performance or make data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information is a highly complex, multi-dimensional and multi-disciplined issue. It is an ongoing challenge to convert data into knowledge that is reproducible and sustainable. No single employee or vendor can provide a comprehensive solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Handling the massive amounts of data generated by a plant is not a small endeavor. A number of elements must be considered, including information quality, legacy systems, data visibility, security concerns, etc. It is impossible to take everything into account upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many plants are data rich but knowledge poor. They record gigabytes of raw data ranging from trivial transactions to critical business indicators. The rapidly changing global market has put more pressure on the ability to quickly make data-driven decisions. As a result, the volume of data needed to manage a company has grown by a factor of 10. Unfortunately, the ability to convert raw data into an actionable database has not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An enterprise information management system should be able to seamlessly integrate in near real time all of the data required to manage the entire plant operation, including each of its functions. It can provide effective coordination of activities and the same real-time information to workers at the appropriate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, adapting to a changing workforce climate with higher turnover demands a multi-dimensional approach. Leaders must understand the dynamics of near and long-term turnover in their organization as well as how younger generations of workers will impact how they recruit, train and operate their business. They must also employ tactics for capturing knowledge from workers approaching retirement before they leave. Utilizing an EAM or CMMS can also help you institute and sustain best practices despite these higher turnover rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/uEUOuUBPn5c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Train and Keep Your Employees</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/1/7/298334b3-7c6b-48d5-b7bb-c15fdb4291c6_training.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 265px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever spent any appreciable amount of money on training employees, you&amp;#39;ve probably wondered whether some of them are going to learn new skills at your expense, only to bolt for greener pastures and take your investment with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So how should an employer react to this possibility or try to head it off? Different organizations take very different positions. For instance, Starbucks appears to be pretty laissez faire about the whole thing. When the coffee shop operator recently unveiled a program to pay for college for employees, it didn&amp;#39;t ask those accepting the offer for any commitment to stay once they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, a diametrically opposed approach is taken by some large financial institutions that shell out big bucks to train investment advisers. These banks and brokerages are so dead set on getting their money&amp;#39;s worth that they will sock trainees with big reimbursement bills if they leave the program or the company early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Taking It Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;#39;s a recent example. Wells Fargo tried to claw back its training investment in a trainee who claimed she was forced out. She sued, arguing that the bank was violating federal labor laws by trying to make her pay back more than $50,000 in alleged training costs. She claimed the bank would effectively be ducking payment of the minimum wage and also overtime if it recouped that amount from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Investment News&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;reports that many large financial firms require commitments from trainees and may seek to recoup their expenses from those who don&amp;#39;t keep those commitments. Typically, trainees are expected to stay for the duration of a program lasting about three years and then a year or two after that. Wells Fargo has trainees sign a five-year contract that values the training at $55,000, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assessing the Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s not our job to judge either Starbucks or the investment firms. These are business decisions made for business reasons. However, going after former employees to recoup training costs may seem a tad harsh to many employers. After all, it may not be worth it when you consider the risk of damaging the company&amp;#39;s reputation, especially in the eyes of potential recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to a recent white paper from IBM, when employees believe they are receiving the training they need, only 22 percent of them say they intend to leave the organization. Some 16 percent are undecided, and the rest (62 percent) intend to stay. But among those who aren&amp;#39;t getting the right training, fully 64 percent say they intend to leave. In other words, training may be more of an incentive to stay than an incentive to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Choosing the Right Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With all these facts in mind, what should a smart organization do about the risk of seeing their training investment walk out the door? First, figure out what the training you offer is worth in dollars and cents on the open market. You might find out what similar programs cost at local community colleges or night schools. Second, use these numbers to let your employees know how much you&amp;#39;re investing in them. They may be impressed by how much you&amp;#39;re willing to spend to help them grow and develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for trying to hold onto people for a while after they complete their training, you don&amp;#39;t have to resort to contracts and lawyers. You can let them know how the training will help them advance within your organization and appeal to their better nature. Explain that it&amp;#39;s only fair you have first crack at the benefits of their training. This thought may give them pause if they&amp;#39;re tempted to jump ship when somebody else offers more money or what they perceive as a better opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5 Essentials for a Thriving Work Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/9/b07e4cce-ba23-4373-871e-b4f86d07c9a3_workplace-culture.jpeg" style="width: 304px; height: 282px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;What makes a successful business thrive? That&amp;#39;s what eight out of 10 new entrepreneurs would like to know, because their businesses fail within the first 18 months, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Creating the right environment is crucial for success. You don&amp;#39;t have to be a business guru to recognize when a business is firing on all cylinders that everyone is putting their skills to maximum use, working together and actually having a good time. How to create that chemistry &amp;ndash; that&amp;#39;s the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, you need folks with the right qualifications who are willing to bring their A-game every day. But there are also character traits to look for: a positive, can-do attitude, for instance. If a person doesn&amp;#39;t fit in the mix, not only will he or she be less likely to bring their best, they can also compromise everyone else&amp;#39;s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does it take to get that hum every CEO wants, both in the office and in one&amp;#39;s respective industry? Consider the following essential building blocks for a thriving work culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Staff Your Team with A-players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An A-player is someone who brings all of the necessary qualifications to the table &amp;ndash; perhaps more than you were expecting &amp;ndash; and that something extra as a human being. Of course, that isn&amp;#39;t always readily apparent during a 45-minute interview; it can take time to see the true colors of a talented individual come through. This speaks to the importance of having an intuitive hiring manager, which may be a small business&amp;#39;s CEO. Also, it&amp;#39;s important to have A-players who put the team first. Egomaniacs who cannot collaborate can grind productivity to a screeching halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Importance of Having Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having fun not only helps your team do well, but it&amp;#39;s also a sign that you&amp;#39;re doing things right. Where fun and work meet is the understanding from employees that they&amp;#39;re making a difference. You want a team of individuals who are motivated by the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; of what they do. Fun at work means having energy and enthusiasm while tending to the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Make Employees and Clients Your Extended Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A family environment significantly facilitates a team mentality, especially for those quiet geniuses who like to keep to themselves because they&amp;#39;re shy. But why stop there? Extend the love to clients, suppliers and other crucial components of the business. Without these folks, your business couldn&amp;#39;t survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Encourage Difference Makers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Team members are driven by the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; of what they do. The right content in the right person&amp;#39;s hands at the right time can change the world forever. Share stories, passion and knowledge to guide and help others learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Commit to Lifelong Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seek to uncover and promote the leader in everyone on your team by encouraging all members to follow a path of personal and professional development. With increased knowledge, experience and skills, people lead a more fulfilled life, which can profit everyone within a working environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/njq2kJXQ9-U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Optimizing Employee Engagement Globally</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Although manufacturing goods in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe offers electronics companies and their manufacturing and solutions partners significant economic advantages, this strategy is not a panacea. When employees feel a company is not meeting their needs, the results can be expensive &amp;ndash; from high turnover and the cost of hiring and training replacements to low productivity and a suffering reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensuring employees are happy and fulfilled is not only the right thing to do, but it&amp;#39;s also good for business. Companies striving for this must often rethink their approach to employee engagement, not just individual initiatives but the overall culture. By carefully evaluating employees&amp;#39; situations and needs and implementing corporate best practices adapted to these different scenarios, manufacturers can improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether it involves better onboarding to make new workers feel at home, training for career advancement or guidance in people management for front-line supervisors, a strategy for improving the employee experience can pay big dividends for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Employee Engagement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept of engagement refers to the emotional commitment of employees to their work and the company. Engaged workers care about contributing to organizational goals and are more willing to lend their time and talent. They&amp;#39;re more willing to go above and beyond their job descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee engagement is complex, ranging from the basics of a safe and comfortable workplace and a decent place to live to career opportunities, education and satisfying work relationships. It also means engendering loyalty, pride and a sense of identity and community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/6/11/af358801-ab14-416f-861b-05a5252e33a1_figure-1.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 399px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Importantly, engagement is a two-way process. Companies must engage employees in their principles, programs and policies, and encourage them to respond through participation. When the process is optimized, the effects can be dramatic. Engaged employees provide a higher level of service, quality and productivity, leading to more satisfied customers and higher revenues. Turnover drops and the company&amp;#39;s reputation is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some metrics on engagement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/6/11/14fe62ac-a309-48e1-898e-29940cdb8f72_figure-2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 506px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Global Engagement Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regional differences, including culture and laws, play a significant role in engaging employees. In China, higher wage rates and increasing labor shortages have defined the market in recent years. Employees &amp;ndash; many of whom have moved hundreds of miles for work &amp;ndash; have their choice of jobs in China&amp;#39;s manufacturing-intensive regions and may be easily persuaded to change jobs for a small increase in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensuring employees have professional and social connections, fair pay and a safe and respectful working environment is key. They must feel comfortable with the company culture and that they are contributing to the company&amp;#39;s success in order for them to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Mexico, where employees typically have extended families nearby, it is important to make certain that they have access to medical care, transportation and schedules that allow them to care for their children. It can be powerful for companies to invest in community-support services such as schools and health centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Engagement from the Ground up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many electronics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and service providers tackle the basics of engagement by providing on-campus dormitories and meals for employees in certain countries, transportation from offsite locations, and health and safety programs. Additionally, a strong corporate commitment to investing in development programs is needed to drive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are a few examples of initiatives that target the full spectrum of engagement needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Welcoming New Employees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conducting extensive onboarding of new employees makes them feel at home in the organization. For example, the global program at Jabil Inc. focuses on three groups: production employees, office employees and managers. Every employee is given a &amp;quot;buddy,&amp;quot; and co-workers from the same home town are encouraged to reach out to the new hire. The company also provides a special kit with a discount card for local stores and information about the next job level to which the worker can aspire. Educational funding is offered to help employees prepare for advancement.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Empowering Individual Advancement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training and education are critical to empower individual advancement. The goal should be to develop competitive, knowledgeable and skilled employees committed to continuous improvement, learning and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At Jabil&amp;#39;s Employee Development International Institute in China, employees are trained for six months in functional skills, English and leadership. In Mexico, another program enrolls high-performing production workers for a year of development in functional skills, English, leadership and university training. In 2013, Jabil delivered more than 500,000 hours of training and education to employees through online and classroom instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Guiding Frontline Managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A manager engagement toolkit can help managers motivate their employees. A structured manager training program will promote the corporate culture and values, which should be part of manager development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tapping the Power of the Smartphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the popularity of smartphones, it is essential to take advantage of this high usage to reach more employees. A &amp;quot;storytelling&amp;quot; contest can encourage employees to take &amp;quot;selfies&amp;quot; with their phones and post them along with a story about innovation, customer service, collaboration, continuous improvement or other areas. The best stories may then be selected and publicized internally. Company news, surveys and training on company culture and corporate values can also be provided via smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, employee engagement is infectious. Just as negative behaviors can cause a downward spiral for a company, employee engagement drives a virtuous upward spiral. Engaged employees affect other employees, and strong overall employee engagement influences customer loyalty. Quality, on-time delivery and cost all improve as employees expend their discretionary effort on behalf of their company and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although employment challenges and employer practices vary across the world, it is clear that an engaged workforce can make a tremendous difference to any organization. Thoughtful policies and programs tailored to the needs of the locality, supported by genuine concern for and interest in each individual, can drive strong loyalty, pride and commitment that are essential to a high-quality end product and financial returns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/eNKq4Mo2Do0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Virtual Teams Can Increase Profits </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As the global economy continues to grow, transnational corporations are expanding their hiring practices by embracing global virtual teams. No longer are corporate headquarters the mainstay for employees. To attract the best employees while tapping into global knowledge, corporations are expanding to allow professionals to work in a virtual environment. While virtual teams can cut costs, they also provide a significantly more varied team base that contributes to the depth and breadth of an organization. As with all teams, virtual teams can be highly functional or highly dysfunctional. Experienced leaders who understand the dynamics of motivation, leadership, quality and communication across diversified cultural divides are in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Creating Leaders for Virtual Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before we explore how and why virtual teams are proliferating at an astounding rate across the globe, it is important to look at the leadership skills necessary for managing these teams. Professionals who have vast experience in managing in-house, onsite corporate teams often lack the base skills necessary for success in the virtual world. One of the strengths of a virtual team is the range of experience and knowledge that stems from a variety of professional backgrounds and cultural backgrounds. Currently, General Electric boasts that more than 50 percent of its current workforce is based overseas. This provides a competitive advantage that allows the company to access local talented professionals who possess expertise as both a consumer and professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Benefits of Virtual Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is vital that virtual team leaders understand the natural differences in communication and motivation to ensure each team member performs to his or her optimal capacity. BP, Nokia, and Ogilvy and Mather are all successfully utilizing professional virtual teams. These organizations and others find that virtual teams boost collaboration, creativity and efficiency. Before virtual teams were common, if the ideal employee lived across the globe, relocation was required. Today, these individuals can stay in their current location and telecommute as part of the team. A recent poll found that 52 percent of corporations surveyed reported that virtual teams are used as &amp;quot;top management&amp;quot; and 79 percent are used as &amp;quot;project teams.&amp;quot; These numbers are projected to grow in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the overlooked benefits to functional virtual teams is the &amp;quot;follow the sun&amp;quot; practice. While some managers may think they want all team members to work the same hours regardless of location, this is not efficient. A virtual team that is comprised of professionals across the globe allows for a 24-hour productivity cycle. As members in one area are wrapping up their day, team members in other time zones are starting their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the risks that corporations with highly concentrated onsite teams face is the &amp;quot;group-think&amp;quot; mentality. While a homogenous team may be easier to manage than a virtual team, the experience, perspective and vision of a multinational team provide much needed insight for tapping into global markets effectively. Statistically, more than 70 percent of the world&amp;#39;s purchasing power is concentrated outside of the United States, so teams without true global insight run the risk of limiting their global market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Need for Diversity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Nestle, foreign sales of its products total 97.8 percent of its total sales. Missed opportunities for marketing, sales and management abound when team member diversity is not embraced. Marketing gaffes happen often when teams are centrally located in the United States and the customer&amp;#39;s culture is not embraced. This is not the fault of team members but due to hiring a homogenous team with little understanding of cultural differences and dynamics. Virtual teams that span the globe help to ensure that marketing communication messages are effective, timely and not offensive. A company like Nestle, which thrives because of its foreign market share, must tap into the knowledge and expertise of its markets. Virtual teams are the ideal component to bridge cultural gaps and increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Who&amp;#39;s Seeking Telecommuting Jobs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Telecommuting once was a function of lower level professionals. This no longer is the case. Professionals from all walks of life, with a wide array of professional backgrounds and education levels, and in nearly every corner of the globe are seeking the freedom, autonomy and collaboration that come with working as part of a virtual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Global Workplace Analytics, 3.1 million workers in the United States telecommuted in 2011, which represented a growth of more than 70 percent in just six years. After the economic downturn of the last decade, many corporations consolidated their headquarters, leaving many professionals far from a job. This has fueled the desire and demand for professional telecommuting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 2012 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management found that virtual teams are becoming more and more prevalent. In fact, according to the survey, 28 percent of U.S.-based corporations use virtual teams, while 66 percent of multinational corporations embrace these types of teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As corporations continue to look for ways to cut expenses and raise productivity and collaboration for greater profits, analysts believe that the number of virtual teams will continue to grow. The importance of leaders who have the knowledge and expertise to lead in a global environment is paramount for success. Effective communication with members of global virtual teams as well as effective marketing communications aimed at a global consumer must be the focus of all organizations seeking greater global profits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using Performance Management to Motivate a Disaffected Team</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you&amp;#39;re in charge of a team, you&amp;#39;ll appreciate that they&amp;#39;re rather tricky animals. At times, all appears well, but you&amp;#39;re achieving little. At other times, you&amp;#39;re reaching your targets, but there&amp;#39;s unhappiness and resentment. If your team has become disaffected, then it&amp;#39;s time to rely on performance management to set people straight again. Following a four-step program should ensure success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Investigate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s vital to establish why a team is disaffected. Usually, it&amp;#39;s related to performance &amp;ndash; of the entire team or of an individual. The cause may be that the wrong objectives have been set. Perhaps your team members feel their objectives are not achievable or not realistic? Performance management will help you to review these targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Implement Performance Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Performance management works best when there is an atmosphere of honesty and openness. Try to encourage this in your people. Clear objectives also need to be set. Ensure they are SMARTER (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound, evaluated and re-evaluated). This useful mnemonic was developed from George T. Doran&amp;#39;s comments in &lt;em&gt;Management Review&lt;/em&gt; and has been in use ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Help your team members understand how they can achieve these targets. They shouldn&amp;#39;t leave the preventive maintenance program until they are clear about the steps they should take to improve their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Giving clear feedback is essential. Many managers, directors and even CEOs fear giving feedback. Perhaps this is because they see feedback as criticism. However, this couldn&amp;#39;t be further from the truth. No one can be expected to improve without being told in which areas they need to improve and which steps they should take to go about it. When giving feedback, it&amp;#39;s helpful to categorize it as &amp;ldquo;feedback,&amp;rdquo; making your intention of offering support evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Set Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensure that any targets are clearly aligned to your company&amp;#39;s objectives. The work that your teams carry out should be considered within the work of the company as a whole. Make this as explicit as possible. Your employees need to know that their work matters and has relevancy within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Praise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As soon as objectives are met, ensure you praise, reward and promote. Your team members must see that you, too, have an eye on their targets. The promise of promotion is a real motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Disaffected teams can be extremely detrimental to any business. When people perform poorly or in a negative atmosphere, no output, no matter how successful, will be sustainable. Fortunately, performance management can tackle the problem head on. Individuals, teams and, ultimately, the company will benefit from a more positive working environment, which can only improve results. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/FlBVaLmI8ro" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Create Employee Engagement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Every organization has rude customers, operational and financial challenges, and employee turnover. However, the tough economy, the feeling that job stability is a thing of the past, the ever-decreasing benefits and bigger workloads have created an atmosphere of malcontent and distrust within the employee ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, most company executives are too far removed from the front line to realize that conditions are ripe for a tsunami of turnover when the recession ends. Supervisors on the front line are busy scrambling to keep their own jobs and are just as frustrated, worried and exhausted as their employees, creating an environment of &amp;quot;every man and woman for themselves!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent Harris Interactive survey uncovered the following statistics on American job satisfaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Across America, 45 percent of workers say they are either satisfied or extremely satisfied with their jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Only 20 percent feel very passionate about their jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thirty-three percent believe they have reached a dead end in their career.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Twenty-one percent are eager to change careers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Older workers are the most satisfied and the most engaged in their work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Younger workers are the most distressed and feel the least amount of loyalty to their employers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Small-firm employees feel far more engaged in their work than their corporate counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job security, health-care coverage and professional development are valued above additional compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is most worrisome is the disconnect between how workers feel about their jobs and careers and how management perceives what they are feeling. This disconnect is evident in the results from the fourth annual survey of employee job satisfaction by Salary.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Approximately 65 percent of respondents said they were &amp;ldquo;somewhat&amp;rdquo; satisfied, but less than 15 percent said they were &amp;ldquo;extremely&amp;rdquo; satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Meanwhile, employers believe that 30 percent of their workers are &amp;ldquo;extremely&amp;rdquo; satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sixty-five percent of employed survey respondents said they are looking around (up more than 17 percent this year). Sixty percent said they plan to intensify their job search over the next three months despite the economy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Nearly 80 percent of responding managers do not believe that their employees will initiate a job search in the next three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One reason for this disparity in actual worker satisfaction and managers&amp;rsquo; perception of worker satisfaction may be that employees are putting on a &amp;ldquo;happy face&amp;rdquo; to ensure that they do not lose their current job. The question then is, &amp;quot;What happens when the job market opens up and new opportunities become available?&amp;quot; I believe that many companies will experience a mass exodus of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A recent survey of 5,000 U.S. workers found job satisfaction to be the lowest in two decades, with interest in their work down 18.9 percent, job security down 16.5 percent, interest in the people at work down 11.6 percent and satisfaction with their supervisors down 9.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a few moments to really look at your employees. The telltale signs of disengaged employees are obvious. Disengaged people exist in all types of businesses, across all industries, and they have always been there, just not in the numbers often seen today. You can spot them by their indifferent, blas&amp;eacute; attitudes. They don&amp;rsquo;t care about the company. They probably don&amp;rsquo;t like their jobs. And, they send negative signals everywhere they go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Disengaged people are like poison. They don&amp;rsquo;t perform their own jobs well. They drive customers away. They have a bad influence on your other staff. Often, they are the cause of conflict and/or low morale within the ranks. Yet few people start off disengaged. It&amp;rsquo;s typically a process that happens over time, as employee and employer expectations grow further and further apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge with the disengagement process is that it can happen slowly and subtly. Usually, there are no big red flags or loud alarm bells that announce the growing discontent of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, engaged employees go above and beyond their job descriptions to get things done. They&amp;rsquo;re committed to the organization&amp;rsquo;s success, and they&amp;rsquo;re willing to take on additional responsibilities to ensure that the company is successful. They feel like part of the team and have the &amp;ldquo;all for one and one for all&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits of creating an engaged workforce are clear. An engaged workforce drives customer loyalty, reduces conflict in the workplace, increases productivity and improves profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At first blush, creating an engaged workforce may seem like an overwhelming task. The good news is that it is neither extremely costly nor complicated to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are several ways to create employee engagement or re-engage your employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Define Engagement: &lt;/strong&gt;You must first understand what employee engagement means to your company. There are many definitions, but each company&amp;rsquo;s culture is unique. Take some time to list the attributes, characteristics and behaviors of engaged employees within your culture. For example, employees should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take pride in their work, delivering quality performance, product and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Deliver exceptional service to customers, driving customer loyalty.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Go above and beyond expectations on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform as a team, working together toward the common goal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Intend to stay with the company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Support the company&amp;rsquo;s decisions during difficult as well as prosperous times.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Display the attitude of &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re all in this together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Clarify the Vision: &lt;/strong&gt;It is impossible for employees to be engaged if they do not understand the vision for the future, the goals of the organization and their part in fulfilling the vision and reaching the goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Clear Expectations: &lt;/strong&gt;Clearly state expectations for employee results and behaviors, holding them accountable for results and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Communicate: &lt;/strong&gt;Give them the good news and the bad news. Do not blindside employees with bad news that affects them. If you are trying to avoid layoffs and/or furloughs by cutting hours, let them know the reasoning behind your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reward and Recognize: &lt;/strong&gt;Let employees know that their contributions are appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Involve the Employees: &lt;/strong&gt;When you are facing tough decisions or experiencing operational challenges, ask for their ideas and input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Understand the Leaders&amp;rsquo; Role: &lt;/strong&gt;There is a direct correlation between the leaders&amp;rsquo; behaviors and the level of engagement within the company. Leaders must demonstrate the same traits and behaviors that are expected of employees. Leaders who are open and honest in communications, are focused on employee well-being, demonstrate positive support for the organization and serve as a role model for engagement provide a positive impact on the overall morale within the employee ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Improving employee engagement does not have to be overwhelming,&amp;quot; says Mike Dolen, managing partner of Kenexa&amp;rsquo;s Global Survey Practice. &amp;quot;There are many ways to take small, incremental steps that lead to sustained improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you adopt all of the steps above to engage or re-engage your employees may depend on your assessed level of engagement within your organization. Whatever you do, do something. Your employees represent your brand, and they have a powerful impact on your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/XqiW_f_MwVY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Develop Leadership Skills by Mentoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Mentorship refers to a personal developmental relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The receiver of mentorship was traditionally referred to as a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; or apprentice. Today, the term &amp;quot;mentee&amp;quot; is gaining acceptance and becoming widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are several definitions of mentoring. Foremost, mentoring involves communication and is relationship based. In the organizational setting, mentoring can take many forms. The formal definition that best describes mentoring is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, social capital and the psychosocial support perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career or professional development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom or experience (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; or mentee).&amp;quot; (Bozeman, Feeney, 2007)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations have started to see the value of mentoring for enhancing work life, performance, commitment and job satisfaction. When mentoring is implemented successfully, there are measurable improvements in employee performance, retention, employee commitment to the organization, knowledge sharing, leadership growth and succession planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A mentor is a person who gives another person the benefit of his or her years of experience and/or education. This experience is shared in such a way that the mentor helps to develop a mentee&amp;#39;s skills and abilities, benefiting the mentee and the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good mentoring relationship is identified by the willingness and capability of both parties to ask questions, challenge assumptions and disagree. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that there&amp;#39;s no one way to mentor. Every mentoring relationship is as unique as the individuals involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mentor is far less likely to have a direct-line relationship with the mentee, and in a mentoring relationship this distance is desirable. Mentoring is rarely a critical part of an individual&amp;rsquo;s job role, but rather an extra element that rewards the mentor with fresh thinking as well as the opportunity to transfer knowledge and experience to a less experienced colleague, peer or employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Difference between Mentoring and Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching is not the same as mentoring. Mentoring is concerned with the development of the whole person and is driven by the person&amp;rsquo;s own work/life goals. It is usually unstructured and informal. Mentors focus on the person (the mentee), that person&amp;rsquo;s career, and support for individual growth and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching is much more about achieving specific objectives in a particular way. Coaching also is more formal and more structured, usually around a coaching process or methodology. Typically, coaching is job focused and performance oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Mentoring Process is a Two-way Street with Mutual Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For mentoring to be successful, the mentor and mentee must collaborate on the process. The first meeting should be a face-to-face meeting where the following criteria are determined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The goals for the mentee&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The scope of responsibilities each person is assuming&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Time commitments agreed to by both parties&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Logistics of the process (how, when and where meetings and communications will take place)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Agreement on the definition of confidential information and how that information will be addressed throughout the process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Topics or issues that are outside of the mentoring boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The process for dealing with conflicts and/or obstacles that may arise during the mentoring process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How and when to end the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Effective Mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following guidelines describe an effective mentoring relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentee has no direct-line reporting to the mentor. This fosters trust, and the mentee feels more comfortable in sharing uncertainties about his or her abilities, creating free-flowing, open communication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentor/mentee relationship is mutually satisfying. The mentor gets the satisfaction of watching someone grow who values his or her insights. The mentee gains a feeling of being valued, receiving beneficial direction and attention from someone who he or she respects and admires.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The intensity of the relationship is matched. It is taking up actual and mental time in proportions with which both people are comfortable. This time commitment is flexible as the mentee&amp;#39;s needs change. Sometimes several meetings are necessary during a very challenging period, then none for months.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At any time, either party can stop the relationship and the mentoring process. There is no obligation for continuance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An effective mentor gives wise counsel, and the mentee feels comfortable speaking on issues that may be sensitive. Once this trust is developed, the mentor can give advice or assist with tough recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentor is not mentoring two people at the same time who have a close working relationship. Discretion and confidentiality are paramount. The rules of engagement are stated up front with an agreement between the mentor and the mentee on who should be aware of the mentoring relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The obligation for continuing is two-sided. When the mentor feels he or she has value to add and the mentee is getting something from the relationship, the mentoring may go on indefinitely, or either side can end it without justification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mentoring programs are about guidance and facilitation rather than formal training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	How Mentoring Relationships Go Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are several reasons that a mentoring relationship may fail. Since a successful mentoring relationship is built on trust and the mutual commitment for both parties to hold up their end of the agreement, it is not surprising that the circumstances for failed mentoring are directly related to the failure in the relationship between the mentor and the mentee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following is an excerpt from a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report in collaboration with MIT Sloan Management Review dated Monday, May 24, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Conflict in values: &lt;/strong&gt;This type of conflict creates a lack of trust or rapport between the two parties. If neither the mentor nor the mentee is able to bend or compromise, they may find themselves unable to work together effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Neglect of the mentee: &lt;/strong&gt;If the mentor does not show an active interest in the mentee and act in positive ways to advance his or her career, this neglect can erode the mentee&amp;rsquo;s trust and faith in the mentor. Most mentors go into the relationship sincerely intending to give the mentee what he or she needs to succeed. It may be that the mentor&amp;rsquo;s schedule interferes with his or her availability, or the mentor may be experiencing excessive challenges with his or her own career, creating the feeling of neglect and frustration on the part of the mentee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Mentors who manipulate the mentee: &lt;/strong&gt;Mentee manipulation is most common when the mentor is the mentee&amp;rsquo;s direct supervisor or an upper supervisor from the same department. Manipulation comes in three forms:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Tyranny &amp;ndash; This form of management by intimidation is a complaint that is often heard from mentees. For example, a mentor may threaten to demote a mentee unless he or she pulls an all-nighter to fix a problem created by the mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Inappropriate Delegation &amp;ndash; This includes requiring the mentee to do work that the mentor should be doing or withholding assignments that are coveted by the mentee and that would promote the mentee&amp;rsquo;s growth and development.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Politicking &amp;ndash; This involves malicious acts like sabotage and taking undue credit with the intention of harming the mentee&amp;rsquo;s reputation, usually with the intention of making the mentor look good.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Mentees who manipulate the mentor: &lt;/strong&gt;Although mentees have fewer resources at their disposal, mentor manipulation is not unusual. For example, the mentee may be attributing failures to the mentor and success to himself or herself in order to look good to senior management. This form of manipulation allows the mentee to use the mentor to forward his or her own advancement at the expense of the mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage against mentors: &lt;/strong&gt;When a mentee attempts to damage the career of the mentor, it is often revenge motivated. The mentee may be trying to retaliate for being passed over for promotion, for example. The mentee may blame the mentor for failure to achieve his or her goals. At times, the sabotage may be unintentional, e.g., the mentor may have stepped up to recommend the mentee for a higher or more responsible position. If the mentee fails, this may reflect poorly on the mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Submissive mentees: &lt;/strong&gt;This is usually a case where the mentee relies too heavily on the mentor, and the mentee&amp;rsquo;s abilities for independent thinking and growth are stifled. This situation also may cause the mentor to inadvertently take control in an effort to ensure the success of the mentee. In either case, the mentee&amp;rsquo;s ability to grow and prosper can be hindered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, how do you avoid the pitfalls of bad mentoring relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Provide support and training for mentors and mentees: &lt;/strong&gt;Whether the company has a formal or informal mentoring program, mentors should go through a training program prior to taking on mentoring responsibilities. Support must be provided where the mentor or mentee can seek advice or assistance if either party feels that the relationship is not progressing in a positive way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Recruit right-fit mentors: &lt;/strong&gt;People who volunteer to be a mentor are more likely to put in the time and effort and have the right skills for mentoring. Mandating that a person take on a mentoring role is a sure way to create failure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Match the mentor with the mentee: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that the mentor and the mentee have things in common and have shared values, creating mentoring relationships that are more likely to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Provide feedback: &lt;/strong&gt;Mentors can share appraisals and progress with the mentee&amp;rsquo;s supervisor, who has a vested interest in the mentee&amp;rsquo;s progress and development. Someone from human resources also should be in the loop in the event that problems arise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for the end: &lt;/strong&gt;To avoid hurt feelings, everyone should be prepared to understand that mentoring eventually ends. When the mentor has shared all he or she can share and/or the mentee has learned all he or she can from this mentor, it is time to end the mentorship. Preparing in advance will help to avoid hurt feelings when the time comes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are considering seeking out a mentor, here are seven tips for maximizing your mentoring experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Choose the best mentor to meet your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Begin your mentoring relationship by discussing mutual goals and expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Practice the highest standards of professionalism.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Learn to accept and give feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Practice good communication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recognize that your success is your responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are considering becoming a mentor, below are some of the benefits of mentoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Learning new things about yourself: The self-reflection that can result from a mentoring relationship can be a powerful growth experience, giving you new and revealing insights about yourself, your skills and your experience.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Satisfaction of passing on knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Contributing to the success of your organization by developing others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Acquiring new knowledge: Often, the mentor also learns new skills and ideas from his or her mentee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Expanding your networking contacts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Building confidence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assists you in staying current with issues and developments in the next generation of professionals and within your company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s business environment, everyone has more work to perform, more responsibilities and more stress. Given this, you may ask yourself, &amp;quot;Why would I want to create additional time commitments on my schedule to become a mentor?&amp;quot; The simple answer is that mentors, through the process of mentoring, learn to be stronger leaders by developing exceptional interpersonal skills. Through the mentoring relationship, mentors often discover new resources in the form of innovative and creative ideas that are presented during the mentoring learning process and improved human resources through the development of promising new talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/aCJFznxrT_E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Using Value-chain Analysis for Effective Talent Management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Would you like to maximize the value impact of your talent-management process? Consider conducting a value-chain analysis of your organization&amp;rsquo;s logistical activities for recruiting, hiring, retaining and growing your human capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies most often think of the value chain as it relates to manufacturing and technical processes, but seldom do they consider their value chain when designing talent-management processes. However, to maintain a competitive advantage, especially during hard times, managing the human resources value chain is a critical component of an organization&amp;rsquo;s future success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The term &amp;quot;value chain&amp;quot; was first introduced by Michael Porter in the book &lt;em&gt;Competitive Advantage: Sustaining Superior Performance&lt;/em&gt;. Typically associated with manufacturing firms in the past, value creation and subsequently competitive advantage through value-chain analysis and management provides an effective strategy for all businesses seeking streamlined, efficient operational processes that contribute to overall competitive strategy and therefore the bottom line of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simply put, a value chain refers to the chain of activities within a firm&amp;rsquo;s operations. Constructed at the business unit level, the value chain is a horizontal look at a firm with a process-product perspective vs. the departmental view used for the budget. Products and services pass through all activities of the chain, and ideally, at each activity, the product or service gains value. Porter&amp;rsquo;s value-chain model describes the components as having primary activities and support activities, with the human resource management functions of recruiting, hiring, retaining and growing right-fit human resources as a key part of the support component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Value-chain Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Value-chain analysis refers to the activities within and around the organization and relates them to an analysis of the organization&amp;rsquo;s competitive strengths. Capturing the value generated along the chain is an approach popular with management strategists and can be looked at from an external and internal perspective. The external perspective, often referred to as the &amp;quot;value system,&amp;quot; includes internal factors as well as all external factors that impact the chain (e.g., vendors, vendors to the vendors, external corporate partners, outsource partners, etc.). A value-chain analysis from the internal perspective looks only at the in-house processes and policies of the value chain with consideration for how external factors may impact the internal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Analyzing Your Talent-management Value Chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The purpose of analyzing the value chain of your talent-management process is to identify how each business activity within the process contributes to your overall competitive strategy and where there may be efficiencies and cost savings to be gained within the process. An organization may create a cost advantage through value-chain analysis by reducing the cost of the individual activities within the value chain or by reconfiguring the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Steps in the Talent-management Value-chain Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Identify or clarify your overall competitive strategy: &lt;/strong&gt;This may mean revisiting your vision and/or mission, or reiterating the firm&amp;rsquo;s short-term and long-term goals, ensuring that everyone within all departments in the organization is on the same page.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Activity analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;Identify each activity undertaken in the talent-management process (recruiting, hiring, retaining and growing of human capital). This can be accomplished by conducting a brainstorming session or a business process review (BPR) with key individuals who are responsible for carrying out these activities and those who are impacted by these activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Value analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;For each activity, assess the value that the activity brings to the process. Evaluate the pros and cons of making changes to the process. You must also consider how the changes may affect other departments within the organization and evaluate the overall impact of proposed changes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Planning: &lt;/strong&gt;Design and implement a strategic plan to reduce the costs of the activities within the talent-management value chain or the cost to reconfigure the value chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, you can apply these steps to the recruitment component of the talent-management value chain. The first step is to ensure that the recruitment process supports the activity of attracting right-fit employees who will deliver on the competitive strategy of the organization. This may mean attracting people to the organization who have proven customer-service skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How the organization attracts right-fit employees is directly related to the recruiting activities. During the activity analysis, consideration must be given to the activities within all departments that are or should be involved in recruiting efforts (e.g., marketing, operations and communications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Marketing may determine the types of ads to be placed, such as print ads for magazines and newspapers, electronic ads posted online, radio ads, etc. The marketing or communications departments may individually or collaboratively determine the verbiage and the aesthetics of the ads, ensuring that the culture of the organization is clearly represented to potential candidates. Operational departments may communicate their labor needs to human resources, clearly outlining the particular requirements of the candidates, such as educational level, experience requirements, physical requirements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further activity analysis involves dissecting every step within each activity. Below is a hypothetical example for a recruitment process utilizing print ads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Designing the ad
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Marketing identifies pictures or artwork, if any, to be used
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit input from the hiring manager within the operations department&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit input from the general manager of the operations department&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Marketing and communications collaboratively identify verbiage to be used: key words or culture-related nomenclature
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit input from the hiring manager within the operations department&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit input from the general manager of the operations department&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Submit for approval to the vice president of the marketing division&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Marketing and communications collaboratively determine the layout of the ad &amp;ndash; the placement of verbiage in relationship to the artwork or pictures, prominence and placement of the company&amp;rsquo;s logo
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit approval from the marketing director&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Solicit approval from the communications director&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Choosing the appropriate print media for the ad
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Magazines&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Newspapers&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Trade publications&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Final proofing of the ad
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the operations manager for final approval&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the general manager of operations for final approval&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the marketing director for final approval&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the communications director for final approval&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determining the run time for the ad
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the finance manager for approval&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Submit to the general manager of the operations department for approval&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Printing and distribution of the ad
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Send to the printer (outsourced)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Printed materials returned to the marketing department&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Marketing distributes the final copy to the predetermined publications for printing&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The value analysis involves analyzing the value impact of each of the activities identified during the activity analysis. In this example, the value analysis reveals cost-saving opportunities by streamlining various activities. In the first step of designing the ad, it is not necessary to solicit input at each step from the hiring manager and the general manager of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it is critical to solicit input from the hiring manager at the beginning of the process to ensure that the recruitment ads will attract candidates with the skills, experience and education to fulfill all job requirements, it is not necessary to solicit input at every step in the process. Cost savings can be realized by streamlining the activities to solicit input from the hiring manager in the beginning and end of the process. Additionally, if the organization has a culture of trust, the general manager of operations can be eliminated entirely from the approval process, trusting the hiring manager to make good decisions regarding her recruitment needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are also potential cost savings related to time efficiencies by allocating one place in the process for executive approvals, such as at the activity step of final ad proofing, if it is determined that executives must approve ads before they go to print. Again, a culture of trust can reduce the list of approvals needed to send an ad to print. If the marketing manager and the communications manager are competent and right-fit for their jobs, is it necessary to send the ad to the marketing and communications director for final approval?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measurements may be available that show certain print publications have not generated positive results in attracting right-fit candidates. Savings can be realized by determining which publications have yielded the best results and then choosing only those publications for ad placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An analysis of the printing activity may reveal cost-saving opportunities if it is faster and less expensive to print the ad in-house. If the organization does not have in-house printing capabilities, the following questions should be asked: &amp;ldquo;How long since we have sourced this function? How long since we have negotiated with the provider for a better price? Are there potentially other companies from which a better price can be negotiated?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the analysis of the value-chain activities is complete, a secondary evaluation must be done before implementing changes. This evaluation process scrutinizes the cost to make changes, not only in monetary terms but also in terms of the impact on other departments outside of the talent-management value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing to remember is that all internal value chains have a relational effect on all other value-chain processes within the organization. The secondary evaluation may show that while cost savings can be realized within the talent-management value-chain process, making these changes may create hardships or additional monetary costs to the departments it impacts. By its very title, the word &amp;quot;chain&amp;quot; is a clue that all departments within an organization are interconnected and that for organizations to operate effectively as an entity, no decisions can be made in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last step involves the development of a strategic plan to reduce the costs of the activities within the value chain or the cost to reconfigure the value chain once the cost-saving opportunities have been identified. Minimally, the strategic plan must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assurance that changes will deliver on the competitive strategies for the organization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involvement of key players from all departments impacted by the changes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A realistic timeline for implementing changes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A dispersal of responsibilities based on the talents and skills of the team&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A measurement process for measuring the impact of changes made within the value-chain process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A process for continuous improvement and ongoing management of the talent-management value-chain process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When conducted effectively, a value-chain analysis is a strategic tool that gives the organization the ability to identify how each business activity within an internal value chain contributes to the organization&amp;rsquo;s competitive strategy, creating synergy between departments and making the strategy more systemic overall. The ability to identify and improve the logistical components of the talent-management process allows an organization to leverage its top asset, the people within the organization. The overarching result is cost savings in the forms of process efficiency, reduced employee turnover and excellent customer service leading to increased market share and customer loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/3XGvPGnAJtw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Train Supervisors for Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the things that I enjoy doing in my maintenance leadership and supervision courses is to provoke the group with situational scenarios and ask them how they would respond. These scenarios are based on real-life experiences that typical organizations fail to prepare supervisors to handle. Truthfully, in many cases, little if any training is given to supervisors, especially those transitioning from hourly roles to leadership and supervision positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that said, I would like to share a true scenario to help illustrate my point. So, here it goes &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You are the only supervisor on duty at the site (no other managers are here), and are actually filling in for the normal supervisor, who took vacation. The site is very large, employing nearly 1,000 people. It happens that only one manufacturing line is running across the weekend, so only about 40 people are present on Sunday&amp;rsquo;s day shift. You happen to be in your office near the plant floor doing one of many administrative tasks that burden shift supervision. One of the operators, Robert, runs up to you and gives you a torn sheet of paper that he found at Michael&amp;rsquo;s work area when he noticed Michael walked away and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The torn yellow note reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am tired of taking this medicine. This life is not worth living anymore when you have to take medicine to be normal. I just want to be like everyone else and be normal. I am going to kill myself. Do not let anyone try to stop me or I will take them out with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the grapevine, you know Michael is bipolar and has had issues taking his medicine before. Needless to say, the previous issues were never to this extent. Robert says he saw Michael heading toward the equipment mezzanine area, which has a number of larger pieces of equipment (plenty of places to hide). Michael carries a 4-inch folding knife in his pocket like most of the other operators in that production area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two security workers onsite &amp;ndash; one patrolling the exterior areas of the site property, the other functions as a receptionist, answering calls and handling people coming through the front door. Like most organizations, the security is handled by a contract security firm that hires people with no real security experience, provides little training and pays slightly above minimum wage. No real help there for your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before you can contemplate your options on how to respond, you find out that two other operators (male and female co-workers of Michael) have left their work areas to locate and talk with Michael, as they are concerned for his well-being. At this point, you really don&amp;rsquo;t know where any of the three people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the supervisor, what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This scenario poses some interesting issues, those of balancing the needs of the organization and those of the individual. The organization has an obligation to protect both the medical privacy and employment of the individual as well as the safety of the people who are exposed to that individual. As I&amp;rsquo;m not a lawyer, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave those aspects to more competent individuals. However, I will say that in many cases neither the human resources department nor the medical group has prior knowledge. If they do, they tend to look the other way until something occurs that forces their hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At any rate, the first thing is to reach out for professional help. Recognize that this is way beyond what many supervisors are trained for. With the safety of all involved, having the security guard contact 911 is the right first step. At this point, you don&amp;rsquo;t know much yourself other than receiving the suicide note, so having someone else make that call is probably OK. It actually frees you up to make a call to your immediate manager or the human resources manager. If you have ever been through crisis-management training, you know that things can go downhill very quickly, so reaching up for management help is the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Needless to say, before you head out from the office, make sure you have communication tools (i.e., a cell phone and a radio). Security generally has cameras at the front reception area monitoring the exits and exterior, so they can advise if Michael is seen leaving the building. They also can direct the emergency responders to the nearest entrance once Michael is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether to evacuate the plant becomes a judgment call. It happens that Michael did seek out the equipment mezzanine and was surrounded by the two operators. At this point, he was isolated except for the two operators. As I mentioned, things can go downhill very quickly, and the best-laid plans can go awry. About the time they were located, and before the emergency response arrived, they headed out of the equipment room, as Michael wanted to take a smoke. They take a path that isolates them even more in a smaller room near an exterior door away from the production areas. Seeing the opportunity, the supervisor notifies security of the location to relay to the responders. The supervisor catches up with the trio near that exterior door and engages them in conversation. As the conversation begins, the police enter through the door with paramedics waiting outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that I mentioned that things tend to happen quickly. In trying to bring the police up to speed quickly and before Michael can be identified, the trio turns 90 degrees and exits back into the plant, headed to the break room for that smoke. At that point, the police are on the scene and you as the supervisor have to turn the situation over to them. You must avoid the temptation to try to intervene on behalf of Michael and get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the situation is under control, you will need to close up the loose ends by making the calls to the manager(s) again, letting them know of the resolution. At the same time, you will need to address the needs and concerns of those operators who were involved in the situation. Realize, too, that you are somewhat limited in what you can say due to medical privacy issues and out of respect for Michael. Someone, ideally from human resources, will need to reach out to Michael&amp;rsquo;s family to let them know of the situation and where he has been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At some point, you will need to write up an incident report and do an after-action review to determine if the organization can learn from the event and if procedures could be improved. Human resources will need to determine if or when Michael can return to work and under what conditions. Needless to say, they will most likely be consulting the lawyers to validate any decisions or actions. While the two operators had the best of intentions, human resources should help them understand the risks they exposed themselves to and offer any assistance necessary with respect to counseling if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supervisors have many challenges. Depending on the day and situation, you may be asked to be a chaplain, a diplomat, a counselor, a psychologist, a referee, a judge and occasionally (but hopefully not for long) a babysitter. I hope this scenario provoked you to give consideration to how you may face a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/VsvOQkH24Fc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Lead in Tough Times</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Leadership is a very broad and nebulous term. Generally accepted definitions of leadership include &amp;quot;the activity of leading&amp;quot; and/or &amp;quot;a person who rules, guides or inspires others.&amp;quot; By these definitions, anyone can be a leader, whether you formally manage and lead a team as a manager or supervisor, or if you just happen to find yourself in a position to influence others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During hard times especially, you need leaders who have the ability to see and seize opportunities as they present themselves. Possessing leadership capabilities does not necessarily have anything to do with a title but has everything to do with future-thinking professionals who are willing to proactively step up to the plate and buy into a culture of progressive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The grid below shows characteristics of managers vs. those of leaders. The questions for you to answer as a business professional or aspiring business professional are: &amp;quot;Which are you?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;For which attributes and characteristics would you like to be known?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/3/6/fa53f689-fdba-4ae0-9f1b-7cf08ccbc8e9_manager-leader-blog image.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 599px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizational consultant and author Warren Bennis once said, &amp;quot;The truth is that no one factor makes a company admirable. But if you were forced to pick the one that makes the most difference, you&amp;#39;d pick leadership.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The leaders who will be most successful during hard times are those people in an organization with the skills and characteristics of a leader vs. those of the manager. Below are five strategies that enable true leaders to lead their teams to not only survive but thrive during tough economic times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Practice Hands-on Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Be visible. &lt;/strong&gt;Get out of the office and onto the floor into the work areas. Hold town-hall meetings and information sessions where everyone is invited. Greet new hires in person and welcome them to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Become a mentor. &lt;/strong&gt;Mentors guide others to success, adding value to the employee experience and grooming internal candidates for promotion. A mentor is able to leverage his or her experience, education and knowledge of the company to develop others for the good of the individual and the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Know your employees. &lt;/strong&gt;Building relationships with employees and learning about them as individuals are proven methods for building employee confidence and loyalty in you and the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Gain a better understanding. &lt;/strong&gt;Set up work experiences and insist that your leadership team does the same. For example, you may require that you and your team work one shift in the operating areas in a front-line discipline at least once a quarter. There&amp;#39;s no better way to get to know your employees as well as gaining an understanding of how your policies, procedures, rules and expectations impact the front-line employee and the work that they perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lead by Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Be a role model. &lt;/strong&gt;Model the behaviors that you expect from your employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Walk the talk. &lt;/strong&gt;If, for example, you tell your employees that times are tough and everyone may have to make sacrifices to ensure that the company stays solvent, then you must make sacrifices as well. You cannot cut hours, cut pay, lay people off and then pay yourself a huge bonus, no matter how much you deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Communicate Effectively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Communicate all news &amp;ndash; good or bad &amp;ndash; openly, candidly and honestly. &lt;/strong&gt;Be sure that the employees have all of the information they need to support the company and contribute to the future success of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Communicate in all directions to all levels of the organization. &lt;/strong&gt;Omitting people from the communication loop creates an environment of fear and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Use appropriate and relevant methods for communication. &lt;/strong&gt;Avoid using e-mail and other forms of written communication if the message is of a critical or complicated nature. Always remember that written communication is open to interpretation. Ensure that your method of communication aligns with the nature of the message. If it is important that the message is not misconstrued in any way, you may need to communicate in person by holding a staff or town-hall meeting, or possibly even communicating one-on-one with individuals on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Become a Change Agent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four major reasons that people resist change are fear of losing something they value, misunderstanding the change and what it means, believing the change is not beneficial, and low personal tolerance for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Embrace change&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;do not brace for change.&lt;/strong&gt; Change is the rule rather than the exception, especially in today&amp;#39;s business environment. In fact, it&amp;#39;s not an exaggeration to say that business in this country will never be the same again. Change is inevitable. Make sure that it is the right change, not change for the sake of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Proactively seek change. &lt;/strong&gt;If you wait until the business is failing, it&amp;#39;s too late. By not proactively changing to keep up with changes in the internal business or external environment, you have given the competition a green flag to take over your market share and put you out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Realize that change is emotional. &lt;/strong&gt;Like it or not, as part of the plan for change, leaders must prepare to deal with the emotions generated by change, big or small, in the organization. People will experience fear &amp;ndash; for their jobs, their positions and their status. They will feel anxiety over what will happen next and wonder what the future looks like for them. Some people become angry, especially if the company is implementing change frequently during a short time span. Leaders who put their heads in the sand and refuse to deal with the emotional aspects of change will experience low morale leading to low productivity, low quality of work and high turnover &amp;ndash; all of which disable the company&amp;#39;s competitive growth engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Involve people in the change. &lt;/strong&gt;Whenever possible, get everyone involved in the change process. This generates buy-in and helps to alleviate some of the more negative emotions surrounding change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Communicate openly and honestly. &lt;/strong&gt;The worst thing that a leader can do is to keep information from employees. In the absence of information, they make it up, making a difficult situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Redefine Operational Efficiencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Assess, assess. &lt;/strong&gt;Regularly assess policies, processes and procedures to ensure that they continue to be effective in the changing environment. During tough times, you must look at your business in new ways. The external environment has changed, and the altered forces driving business require new and innovative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Ask for/listen to employees&amp;#39; ideas. &lt;/strong&gt;One of the biggest challenges is to assess which operational policies and processes may need to change or even be eliminated. Great leaders know that employees have the best ideas and that no one knows better than the front-line employees which operational policies, processes and procedures work and which do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Remove old paradigms. &lt;/strong&gt;Eradicate the phrase, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve always done it this way!&amp;quot; from your and your team&amp;#39;s vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The leaders who will be most successful during hard times are those leaders with the ability to demonstrate the skills for efficiently delivering on these five strategies for growth and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you&amp;#39;re a leader today or a future leader, you should be aware that the game has changed. Leaders for the future will require more skills, more patience, and a new and innovative view of leadership and corporate America in general in order to find success in the new businesses of the 21st century and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/5gXPrJPEKL4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Make it Clear that Change is not Optional</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Charles Barkley is one of those polarizing public figures who tend to divide people into two groups &amp;ndash; fans and detractors. Known as much for his off- and on-court antics as his basketball talent, there is a lot in his history to support either side. Nevertheless, whichever way you feel toward Sir Charles, two things are true: He is a very talented athlete, and he also knows change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When faced with the prospect of his daughters dating, the &amp;quot;Round Mound of Rebound&amp;quot; focused on a key change principle. Referring to the young gentlemen showing an interest in his maturing daughters, he proclaimed: &amp;quot;I figure if I kill the first one, word will get out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so technically Barkley is more interested in avoiding change than managing it, but the principle is sound &amp;ndash; when there are consequences, people pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Change and leadership share a common goal &amp;ndash; influencing behavior in others. When an organization faces change, there are inevitably those in the organization who will resist the change. The real problem, however, is not resistance but how to handle sustained resistance, especially if the resistor is an influential individual in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As change leaders, we can communicate, coach, inspire and motivate, but change comes down to personal choice. When someone makes the choice to not change, it is our job to go &amp;quot;Charles Barkley&amp;quot; on them. I don&amp;#39;t mean that we need to start spitting on an 8-year-old girl or picking a fight with Shaquille O&amp;#39;Neal. What it does mean is that we send a clear message about what behaviors will and won&amp;#39;t be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too often, the primary sponsor for the change is not prepared for the possibility (or probability) that a senior member of the staff will fail to create the necessary sense of urgency to drive the change. When this lack of engagement occurs, the primary sponsor is neither mentally nor emotionally prepared to address the situation, and the organization begins to believe that the change is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders should actively look for and surface legitimate questions and concerns regarding the change. However, once the strategy and direction have been decided, continued and sustained resistance &amp;ndash; either active or passive &amp;ndash; will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In some scenarios, Barkley is unfortunately correct, and a &amp;quot;sacrificial lamb&amp;quot; must be created. There will be times when an influential leader in the organization will continue to resist the change and must be removed. Then, as Barkley so eloquently stated, &amp;quot;Word gets out.&amp;quot; More importantly, though, the sooner that word gets out that there will be consequences, the less likely that severe consequences will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By announcing his philosophy publicly, Barkley undoubtedly created a healthy sense of caution in all potential suitors without the administrative overhead of hiding bodies and cleaning the carpets. Similarly, when leading change, ensure that through word and action the message is clear: This change is not optional. This can do wonders for your carpet-cleaning bill.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Don't Forget People in Strategic Planning</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It has been the norm for decades that organizational strategic plans have been created by upper levels of management. Annually, the best and brightest division heads come together to brainstorm the company&amp;#39;s strategic challenges and solutions, articulate the vision for strategic growth, and formulate the plan for optimizing organizational resources. They will spend days conducting a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis, identifying critical success factors, analyzing the market and formulating the execution process for the new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet with all the time and money spent on strategic planning, often there is a lag in putting the plans into action, or the execution fails to achieve the desired results. All managers know that execution is critical to the success of the strategic plan, but making the plan work is an even bigger challenge than creating the plan, in large part because execution requires a disciplined process or a logical set of connected activities that enables the organization to successfully integrate the strategies into the operation. Many factors inhibit the successful execution of the strategic plan, and all of them are tied to the people of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below is a short list of factors that inhibit successful strategy execution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The culture of the organization does not support the challenges presented by the plan (includes organizational politics and structure).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incentive programs reward people for seniority rather than results.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Departmental and divisional silos in the organization inhibit the sharing of information and teamwork.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is resistance to change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The vision for the plan&amp;#39;s impact on the future of the organization is not clearly articulated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is a failure to clearly describe the employees&amp;#39; role in the implementation of the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Employees implementing the plan are lacking the tools, knowledge and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is a failure to hold people accountable for their part in successfully implementing the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Execution takes longer than planning, so managers who are caught up in the daily challenges of running their operations may lose focus and/or interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Harvard Business Review (HBR) recently conducted a study of 1,075 people from the HBR Advisory Council asking about strategy and execution in their companies. The results, which were printed in the July-August 2010 edition of HBR Magazine, showed that the obstacles to executing strategy in the current economy included being too busy/lack of time and resource constraints, while the obstacles to executing strategy in general were making it meaningful to front-line employees, translating strategy to execution and aligning jobs to strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for the most important aspect of strategy execution, clear communication was rated highest by most respondents (72 percent). One respondent said, &amp;quot;Failure to communicate strategy causes front-line workers to invent their own strategy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other high priorities identified were effective leadership and a commitment to putting the right people in the right jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the biggest roadblocks to successful strategy execution, as stated by the respondents, was &amp;quot;encouraging managers to make decisions in line with the strategy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, when the strategic plan is not successfully executed, it is the employees who come under fire. It is usually assumed that the plan failed because the employees do not care enough about the company and/or are not smart enough or dedicated enough to make it work. In actuality, the root of the problem is that managers still don&amp;#39;t know a great deal about the execution of strategy. Management training in the past has had a strong focus on teaching managers strategy formulation, but very little is taught about strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The question then is &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t more companies spend more time and money training managers to successfully execute?&amp;quot; The answer is that execution is very difficult. Complicating the difficulty of the logistics of execution is the unfortunate idea by many C-level and upper-level managers that they (the &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; people) plan the strategy, while the underlings (the front-line, &amp;quot;not-so-smart&amp;quot; people) execute the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This difficulty can be mitigated by remembering that planning and execution are interdependent. Successful strategic results can be gained when the people responsible for execution are involved in the planning and strategy formulation process. According to the survey by HBR mentioned above, 59 percent of respondents said there is an imaginary line in their company between the thinkers and the doers, and only one-third said that strategy creation is part of everyone&amp;#39;s job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, managers should keep in mind the process for execution as they are planning the strategy. Simultaneous strategy formulation and planning for execution will help to remove many roadblocks by anticipating the potential barriers prior to execution of the plan, providing savings in time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following strategies and tactics will help to ensure that strategy execution in your organization is successful and effective, delivering the expected results to meet the company&amp;#39;s goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Develop a Plan for Execution with the Strategic Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that strategy formulation and execution are interdependent. Simultaneously create your strategic plan and plan for execution to minimize roadblocks and barriers such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cultural elements that conflict with strategy processes and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reward and recognition practices that inhibit rather than promote effective strategy implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job descriptions that do not align with skills necessary for plan implementation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interdepartmental/divisional silos that restrict or inhibit communication and/or teamwork&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Current policies and/or processes that are in conflict with actions necessary to successfully implement the plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Involve Key Players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be sure to involve the key players from all levels of the organization who will be responsible for execution of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Communicate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You must effectively communicate the vision for the expected results from the plan, the intended goals for the plan, including a comprehensive timeline, the employees&amp;rsquo; role in implementing the plan, the &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s in it for me?&amp;quot; to make it meaningful to the employees and gain commitment to the goals, as well as the parameters for follow-through and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Set up Employees for Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, it is critical to provide the skills, knowledge, tools and resources to ensure employees are set up for success in execution of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/egFpCPE8X8M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Importance of Visible Leadership</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Recently I caught a few moments of the reality show where the CEO goes out &amp;quot;undercover&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; albeit with a film crew &amp;ndash; to capture what is really happening in the trenches of an organization. It reminded me of how frequently we fail to understand what is going on in our own world during the off-shifts and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I have mentioned many times in the past, you cannot manage people or build relationships with them from behind a desk. You have to get out where the work occurs and inspect and interact. In the end, we get what we inspect. It is not just getting out during the day shift, but how many of you as managers actually rotate around on the different shifts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One plant manager that I know required her staff members (all of them, including those in finance and human resources) to pull a six-week shift rotation every year, covering all production shifts. It forced them outside of their comfort zone to learn about the issues in the factory and how they could better support the people who do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a maintenance and operations manager, I would often overlap shifts and come in at 2 a.m. to work. No one knew when I might show up, as it was not a published schedule. No, I was not trying to hammer people. I was simply trying to see what processes worked and understand the issues with which the people were struggling. Sure, when I started, people were suspicious of my motives. It is all about how you approach people and the relationships you build. I worked hard to show them that I was trying to improve the work environment and support their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As it was not a union environment, I could help an operator by sweeping the floor around a machine if needed during a startup shift while they lined out a packaging machine. I can tell you that they really appreciated the effort. I might come in during a changeover or during a production shutdown. I might spend some time looking at the maintenance and operations shift overlap communications. There are endless opportunities if you will just look for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I challenge you to go look for some opportunities as well. You just might be surprised at what you find. What are you waiting on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/F6sqHVPRAQk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Deal with Difficult People</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	One of the first people to study difficult employees in the workplace and to assign specific characteristic descriptors to these groups of people was Robert M. Branson. In 1981, he wrote a book called &amp;quot;Coping with Difficult People.&amp;quot; In this book, he identifies seven categories of difficult people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hostile-aggressive&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Complainers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Silent and unresponsive&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Super agreeable&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know-it-all experts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Negativists&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Indecisive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, these seven categories have been consolidated into three broad categories with very distinct characteristics. These three categories incorporate the characteristics and behaviors of Branson&amp;#39;s original seven categories. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Aggressor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Victim&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rescuer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most experts believe that it is useful to characterize difficult people and then try to understand them as individuals. For each of these people, social and economic conditions had a lot to do with creating who they are. Contrary to popular belief, difficult people are usually not deliberately toxic, non-productive troublemakers. In fact, they are often employees whose intentions are good and are dedicated and loyal to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is also important to note that if behaviors are especially malicious, this goes beyond the definition of difficult and is now labeled destructive. Below are brief definitions of the three categories of difficult people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Aggressors: &lt;/strong&gt;Their actions and behaviors are based on the belief that they must demonstrate a tough personality to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Victims: &lt;/strong&gt;Sincerely want to do a good job and feel as though they would be successful if others would give them what they need.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Rescuers: &lt;/strong&gt;Lose focus on their own productivity and responsibilities because they are convinced that they are doing the right and humane thing and the best thing for the organization by taking care of others who can benefit from their expertise and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seldom do these individuals act in a vacuum. The very nature of their personalities is to interact with others in the organization in ways that satisfy their particular needs. This is illustrated by the Karpman Triangle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/14/e2ffb0be-c586-4f9a-a41c-5f5081c5c687_Karpman-triangle-image.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 108px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conceived by Steven Karpman and originally devised as a therapeutic tool, it is also used as a communications device to plot the moves of a series of interactions between people. It demonstrates how the three difficult people personality types may play off one another or may even change places as the situation warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, aggressive people find and create victims. Victims are easy prey for bullies. Victims do not get the job done but always have excuses as to why it is not their fault. Rescuers jump in to save the victim. The cycle can go round and round, with each playing their role, effectively supporting the behavior of the other two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One type may also morph into another. For instance, if a rescuer and a victim should push back very hard on an aggressor, the aggressor may revert to victim behavior. The aggressor may say things like, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not my fault,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I was just told to do this,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I have to act like this,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No one will help me,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No one likes me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a manager, you must stop the cycle. Managers, co-workers and team leaders can have a positive impact by understanding who these people are and what drives them and then reacting in ways that diffuse rather than escalate the behaviors. Below are the characteristics of each type of difficult person and tips for dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Characteristics of Aggressors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Demanding and loud&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Poor listeners&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Interrupters&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Must-win&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sarcastic/rude&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bullies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Aggressors are often tolerated in the workplace because they tend to be productive and get things done, usually in all the wrong ways. Often, because they are productive, they are promoted into management and executive positions. The Type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; manager of the 1970s and &amp;#39;80s is a great example of the aggressor personality type. No matter their level in the organization, what must be considered is how they are impacting others&amp;#39; ability to get work done, their effect on morale and the consequences of employee turnover as a direct result of the aggressor&amp;#39;s behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tips for Dealing with Aggressors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Let them vent: &lt;/strong&gt;Letting them vent satisfies their need to get it all out. Wait for them to calm down. Try not to prejudge.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Use active listening skills: &lt;/strong&gt;Practice active listening skills by listening to understand, not to respond. Hold your thoughts, make eye contact and take notes. Remain objective and do not take what they say personally. They may actually have a valid point once you get beyond the aggressive and dominating behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Keep your emotions under control: &lt;/strong&gt;An emotional response will only add fuel to the fire. If you try to point-and-counterpoint with an aggressor, you will lose and possibly say something you will regret later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Hold your ground: &lt;/strong&gt;Do not change your position out of intimidation. If you allow an aggressor to intimidate you into getting his or her way, you will have supported the unacceptable behavior, further convincing the aggressor that bullying behavior gets results.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Address the key issue only: &lt;/strong&gt;Clarify their point on the key issue. Do not get drawn into other issues. As aggressors get going, they may bring up all of the things that ever bothered them. Calmly say things like, &amp;quot;For now, let&amp;#39;s focus on your key point.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Do not embarrass them: &lt;/strong&gt;Do not embarrass them in public. This creates an aggressive defensive reaction, escalating the angry behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Give them a way out/seek a win-win: &lt;/strong&gt;Aggressors need to feel respected, even if they cannot be right. Say, &amp;quot;You know, I hear what you are saying and you make some valid points, but in order for us to move forward, it has been determined that the best path is &amp;hellip; and we are asking that you become part of the team, even if you think we are wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Characteristics of Victims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Appear to be timid/helpless&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Believe that people don&amp;#39;t understand them or their situation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tend to feel sorry for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tend to blow things out of proportion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Blame others for their problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Victims have a seemingly endless list of excuses as to why they do not get their work done or accomplish their goals. They will often point fingers at someone else or to circumstances that they feel were beyond their control. Victims can be heard to say things such as &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not my fault,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t have the information (or tools) I needed,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No one explained it to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tips for Dealing with Victims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Listen: &lt;/strong&gt;Again, listening is going to be the critical skill that gains results. As with aggressors, practice active listening skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Provide feedback on your understanding of what the victim says and show empathy for how they feel about the situation: &lt;/strong&gt;The victim will give you plenty of time to respond. They need for you to respond. They want feedback, especially that they did OK and that you understand why they had difficulties getting their work done or accomplishing the goal. However, you must resist the temptation to support their need for validation in their behaviors and failures. Your feedback should only validate that you understand what they are saying.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Focus on solutions and the future: &lt;/strong&gt;Clearly communicate what they should do differently next time. Precisely state your expectations for future deliverables and behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Find ways to help them achieve short-term wins: &lt;/strong&gt;Tell them what they are doing right. Give them an example of something they did well in the past and encourage them to perpetuate that behavior or action.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Demand solutions for complaints: &lt;/strong&gt;Do not let them complain without giving solutions. It is more difficult for them to remain the victim if they are part of the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Help them prioritize their problems (or perceived problems): &lt;/strong&gt;Assist them in putting things in perspective. Be honest. Say things like, &amp;quot;I understand what you are saying, but the fact is I need results from you. What can I do to help you meet our expectations?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Characteristics of Rescuers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always willing to help others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Need to be liked and appreciated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know-it-all behavior&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know how to jump in to save the day&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Avoid confrontation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; people&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take responsibility for others rather than themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At first, rescuers may seem like the ideal employee, always willing to help. However, in their need to help others and therefore be appreciated and liked, they tend to over-commit to others and are often not able to deliver on their own work. They soon become a source of frustration to fellow employees and managers. Rescuers are often the know-it-alls. Be aware when dealing with these people that one of the things that drives their rescue behavior is their belief that they know more than everyone else, including the managers. Rescuers may bend or break the rules to achieve rescuing goals because they believe they know what is best for the project, department and/or organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tips for Dealing with Rescuers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Hold them accountable: &lt;/strong&gt;Rescuers must be held accountable for their behaviors. Coaching and counseling at the very least may be in order to get them to see that they cannot be all things to all people and in fact would better serve the organization if they would focus on doing an exceptional job on their own work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Assign them more responsibilities: &lt;/strong&gt;If rescuers do not have enough responsibility to keep them busy, they will revert back to their natural habit of rescuing others in &amp;quot;their spare time.&amp;quot; It may be beneficial to give them additional tasks and responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Clearly and concisely describe parameters and deliverables: &lt;/strong&gt;Explain to the rescuer that he or she has certain tasks that must be taken care of in order to be successful in the organization. If that person perceives that someone he or she works with is in trouble, encourage that person to bring it to the manger&amp;#39;s attention and then let it go.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Be appreciative, sincere and respectful about their contributions: &lt;/strong&gt;Thank them for their contributions. Tell them you appreciate their dedication to the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Avoid putting the rescuer on the defensive: &lt;/strong&gt;An indirect approach is usually very effective with the rescuer personality. You might say, &amp;quot;I understand how important this project is to you, so let me explain how you can help the most.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Help them see that others need to learn on their own: &lt;/strong&gt;If the rescuer sees that he or she may be having a negative impact on a co-worker by always bailing them out, that person is more likely to see his or her behavior as damaging rather than helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;If possible, use them as a trainer or coach to help others: &lt;/strong&gt;This satisfies the person&amp;#39;s need to rescue and channels the energy in a helpful way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is true that difficult people can absorb a great deal of a manager&amp;#39;s time. However, most organizations find great benefit in taking the time to understand them and help them refocus their energies on behaviors that are productive and positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;#39;s face it; difficult people are not going away, partly because they do not see themselves as being the difficult person. This does not mean that you can let difficult employees&amp;#39; behaviors have an ongoing detrimental effect on the organization. If you cannot redirect their energies and change those behaviors that negatively impact fellow employees and the operation, you may have to fire them. But firing all difficult people is not practical, nor is it the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lastly, I would challenge you to look in the mirror and answer the question, &amp;quot;Are you a difficult person?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/cSvMDQ247MM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Create a Culture to Retain Top Talent</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Now more than ever it is important to understand what keeps people working and doing their best for the organization. While the current economic situation has created tough times for businesses, it has also created one of the highest unemployment rates in decades. However, there is a misnomer related to today&amp;#39;s high unemployment rates, and that is that people will not leave their organization because it is too difficult to find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact is that talented people can find a job anywhere. One of the ways to lose talented workers is through passive recruiting&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; This is a process where companies who are hiring (and there are still plenty of them) are vigorously recruiting talent who are not looking for another job. For all intents and purposes, these employees are happy with their current company and satisfied to have a good job. The recruiting company approaches these people offering more money, better working conditions, more benefits, higher status, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most important tasks ahead of you is to keep the existing workforce engaged and productive. To accomplish this when people are anxious about the future of the organization or the prospect of being the next to go, it is a matter of showing your employees that you value them and their loyalty and that they are not just a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You not only want to keep them, but you also want to motivate and inspire them to perform exceptionally for the organization. Pat Galagan, editor-at-large for the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), had this to say in the March issue of &lt;em&gt;Economy Watch&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;quot;People are critical to the success of every organization. The leaders and organizations that adopt the smartest strategies for attracting and retaining their key talent will survive this economic crisis and be in a prime position to come out of it poised to move ahead of their competition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee turnover is a serious matter. It is not only costly to the organization, but it also creates low morale and serious talent gaps. You should be measuring your turnover rate. Anything above 5 percent should be of great concern. You can also calculate your retention rate. However, the retention rate alone can be misleading. For example, if you hire 100 people at the beginning of the month and 10 people leave at the end of the month, your retention rate is 90 percent. The formula for calculating retention is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/11/bbe16d23-9083-4874-b5fc-968f83d0cd84_top talent 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 151px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, the retention rate looks excellent. It appears that you have lost only 10 employees. But what if you hired 50 employees after the first day of the month and 40 of them left before the end of the month? You will get a truer picture of employee attrition if you measure turnover. The formula for calculating turnover is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/11/48fa8356-7f0e-4907-bc02-07c8a6560fa8_top talent 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 134px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, even though your retention rate is 90 percent, your turnover rate is 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, measuring the retention and the turnover rate still does not tell the whole story. Consider examining the voluntary vs. the involuntary turnover. In order to reduce turnover, you must have a strong understanding of how many people are leaving voluntarily. Only then can you take action to reduce the turnover rate. In the above example, of the 50 employees who left the company, 39 left as a result of permanent layoffs and one was fired for violation of company policy. The remaining 10 were recruited away by the competition. Below is the formula for calculating voluntary turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com.s3.amazonaws.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/11/9dd31cab-6eaf-49bd-9923-6a2227e176f1_top talent 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 118px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Calculating your turnover rate and understanding why employees leave is critical to retaining your top talent. The following are steps that you can take to create an organizational culture that contributes to talent retention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create an environment of trust
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Honor responsibilities to workers: Determine what you believe are your responsibilities to your workers. The best way to do this is to ask them. Is it more, cleaner or nicer break rooms/restrooms? It could be any number of things. The best organizations take the time to find out. Is it better communication? Often it&amp;#39;s the little things.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Ask for their ideas and implement as many as possible&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Follow through on commitments&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Ensure fairness in company policies&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Hold everyone accountable in a consistent manner for delivering on goals&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Give people meaningful tasks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create a motivated, inspired, satisfied workforce&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create conditions for job satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make employees feel connected, like they belong to the company, and the company values them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Foster a culture of engagement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reward and recognize
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Identify behaviors that support the culture and reward those employees who demonstrate those behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Determine how to recognize: Ask employees, &amp;quot;Do you want to be recognized in public or would you prefer private recognition?&amp;quot; Also, be sure to personalize the presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Be consistent and fair in recognition&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Create developmental opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What does your company do to try to retain right-fit talent? What does your company do to reduce voluntary turnover? Or, what doesn&amp;#39;t your company do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/BC0bizmf038" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Managing a Multi-Generational Workforce</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders today are facing the most complicated workforce in the history of corporate America. For the first time ever, four generations are working side by side, each at different life stages, and each with conflicting perspectives, expectations and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The members of each of these groups &amp;ndash; the Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y &amp;ndash; have largely been shaped by the social and economic events that have occurred during their lifetimes, and each group has very different perspectives and expectations as they relate to jobs and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Multi-Generational Workforce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following is a brief description of each of the four generations, including their characteristics and the social and economic conditions that shaped these people&amp;#39;s values and work ethic. Please note that there is more than one opinion on the actual dates used to identify the lines between generations, so it is possible you may have read or heard slightly different dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Traditionalists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This generation is also referred to as the veterans or the silent generation. There were 52 million Traditionalists born between 1901 and 1942. They are the keepers of the workplace Holy Grail of yesterday and a pain in the neck to the action-oriented boomers and technology-savvy Xers. While it is true that they are nearing the end of their full-time work life (less than 5 percent are active in the workplace today), they are still solid, no-nonsense performers who tend to exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		American values&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Civic pride&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loyalty/dependable&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Respect for authority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Disciplined (value obedience over individualism)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Believe in the concept of law and order&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Live by the adage, &amp;quot;An honest day&amp;#39;s pay for an honest day&amp;#39;s work.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Oriented to the past (may say things like, &amp;quot;In my day &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conformers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Logical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Traditionalists grew up in the industrial age where wonderful, grand inventions made life easier (automobiles, railroads, motels, service stations and air travel). Manufacturing offered consistency in processes and unheard of conveniences as well as guaranteed income. Many of this generation abandoned farms that had dried up during the great Dust Bowl of the 1930s and went to work in the factories in the cities. When the country called for service during World War II, they served with pride and without hesitation. This generation lived through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, learning self-discipline to survive. They did not live beyond their means and learned to work hard to take care of their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general, this generation believes in doing the right thing. Decisions and actions should be logical and justifiable. They are disciplined and dislike confusion. They may be resistant to change and need all of the information to make a decision or to be convinced to change. They do not take work for granted, and they have a strong sense of responsibility to family and the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Traditionalist&amp;#39;s leadership manner tends to be that of a directive leader with a command-and-control style. Traditionalists will have difficulty in an open and empowered environment, preferring to be the executive decision-maker with the expectation that people will do what they are told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the leader, they expect that they will be followed unconditionally as they did when they were the employee. They did not question the boss, and they expect their decisions will be honored without question. They may exhibit traits of the &amp;quot;Type A&amp;quot; manager with a &amp;quot;My way or the highway&amp;quot; attitude. As you can imagine, this leadership style does not sit well with the younger generations, especially X and Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can assist the Traditionalist leader by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Being patient but firm&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clearly articulating the rules or parameters of the company culture&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coaching them on their people skills&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assisting them with change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Providing information in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Respecting and valuing their life and work experience&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Holding everyone accountable for performance and behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Baby Boomers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Born between 1943 and 1960, the Baby Boomer generation, at 76 million, is the largest ever born. Baby Boomers can be broken into two groups: those born in the 1940s and those born in the &amp;#39;50s. There are subtle differences. Those born in the &amp;#39;40s may also exhibit some Traditionalist attributes and characteristics. This generation is best known for their &amp;quot;Peter Pan&amp;quot; syndrome attitude toward life. You may have heard a Baby Boomer say, &amp;quot;50 is the new 30.&amp;quot; They are having too much fun to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, Baby Boomers grew up in optimistic, positive times of economic growth and expansion. The Vietnam War is the defining moment for Boomers. They were the first generation to buck authority and question the country&amp;#39;s leaders, protesting the Vietnam War and defecting to avoid service, unlike the Traditionalists who jumped at the chance to serve their country in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Children of Traditionalists who had found relative stability in the factory and industrial jobs, these children were coddled and nurtured. Their Traditionalist parents wanted to provide them with the things that they did not have. Baby Boomers were told that they were talented and smart and could be anything they desired. As a result, they grew up believing in themselves and their ability to accomplish anything. For the typical Baby Boomer, no challenge is too big. They aggressively tackle problems and have a strong desire to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because they are driven to succeed and want to please, they are the generation known for their &amp;quot;live to work&amp;quot; philosophy. In general, Baby Boomers can be characterized by their:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Passion about participation and spirit in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Belief in civil rights, empowerment and diversity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Belief in growth and expansion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pursuit of personal gratification&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Service orientation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Drive and ambition&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ability to build and maintain relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Desire to please (family, friends and bosses)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of interest in all things budget-related&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As leaders, you can expect Baby Boomers to demonstrate a consensual style of leadership. They prefer to get everyone involved, consider everyone&amp;#39;s ideas and are concerned about the feelings of others. They bring heart and humanity to the office, preferring to create a level playing field for all. They are excellent at building and maintaining relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Baby Boomers are change agents. They believe in growth and expansion and will seek new opportunities to be successful, in turn creating success for the organization. They are very service-oriented and tend to thrive in service-industry roles. They will work hard to achieve goals, and it is not unusual for their goals to be tied to the goals of the organization. They will look for companies whose values align with theirs; and when they find those companies, their loyalty is unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s important to know that Baby Boomers like tangible rewards. The rewards do not have to be big or include money. They will certainly value a superior&amp;#39;s adulations, but when those adulations come with certificates or small takeaways that can be shown to family and friends, you will find that they will give exceptional levels of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are several challenges for Baby Boomers as leaders. Because they want everyone to be happy, they tend to avoid conflict. It may be very difficult for a Baby Boomer leader to hold people accountable, especially if it involves reprimanding and/or firing someone. They are also not generally budget-minded, as evident in this &amp;quot;plastic generation&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; mountain of personal debt. This does not mean that they cannot become competent at budgeting. However, you will find that this is a task they will prefer to delegate if possible. Because the Baby Boomers tend to be self-focused, they may not be open to others&amp;#39; ideas and tend to be poor listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can assist Baby Boomer leaders by helping them to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Learn to actively listen&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop budgeting skills&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Learn skills for holding people accountable for delivering results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stay focused on project goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Generation X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Born between 1961 and 1980, this generation, the first children born to the Baby Boomers, are referred to as the latch-key kids. While their parents were working their way up the corporate ladder and working long hours, the Xers came home and took care of themselves. A relatively small generation, approximately 51 million born in the United States, this group saw their parents working incredibly long hours with little free time. Consequently, the Xers made a choice, and that choice was to work to live. Don&amp;#39;t be misled; the Xers can be driven in their work if what they want requires it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the biggest misnomers is that the X generation is lazy and does not want to work. These comments are most often made by Boomer or Traditionalist bosses, and this could not be more wrong. Xers just see work differently. They see it as a means to end, not their life. They&amp;#39;re willing to work hard but would prefer that the work happen on their terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The X generation grew up during more uncertain times. They are the generation that graduated from college and were not able to find a job in their field. They are the children of a 60-percent divorce rate, so they often were raised by one parent or shuffled between parents. They are the first generation of children to experience terrorism on our soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because they learned to take care of themselves at an early age, this generation tends to exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Edgy and skeptical&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Change masters&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technology savvy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Self-reliant and unimpressed by authority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Private/keep their own counsel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have a non-traditional sense of time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are non-conformists and unimpressed by authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As leaders, they tend to be fair, straightforward and competent. Their communication style is open and honest, and they tend to &amp;quot;tell it like it is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Challenges for Xers as leaders are that they can be more focused on the task rather than the people. They do not necessarily build relationships easily, and their communication style tends to be brutally honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can assist the Generation X leader by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Helping them to focus on building relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Teaching them soft skills (e.g., coaching and counseling) that complement their technical and operational skills&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assisting them in developing people-oriented communication skills&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Explaining the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; behind policies and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Being frank and honest in your communications with them (i.e., say what you mean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Generation Y&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Born between 1981 and 2000, this generation, also called the Echo generation because they closely echo their Boomer parents&amp;#39; attributes and characteristics, is the result of parents who felt guilty about how they raised their Xer children. These parents were devoted to this generation and its needs, making time in their schedules to be soccer moms, little-league dads and making sure that they enjoyed life. There were swimming lessons, dancing lessons, camp and any other form of activity that would make the Generation-Y children happy. As a result, these children led a structured and sheltered life, tending to have great relationships with their parents, believing them to be cool and more like friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of their diverse activities and exposure to many different kinds of people at an early age, much of it through technology, they are very global. They do not know of a time without the Internet. They have Internet pen pals all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generation Y is worldly and very accepting of differences in people. They often see these differences as an opportunity to learn new things and make new friends. They are the most diverse generation ever born, judging people for who they are rather than their ethnic origins, race, religion or sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having grown up during a time with little strife, a booming economy, doting parents and unprecedented technological advancements, the Y generation tends to exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hopeful and optimistic&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coddled and nurtured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Educated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technology savvy &amp;ndash; even more so than the X generation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Respect and revere their parents&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Resist traditional categorization by race, religion or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Look at things non-traditionally&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Multi-taskers and easily bored&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Global&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For managers, this generation is the most baffling. Compared to the X generation that required little motivation, were self-starters and did not need micro-managing, the Y generation needs structure and specific direction with follow-up. As more of this generation enters the workforce, companies should begin now to prepare for new ways to recruit, hire and retain these employees. Orientation programs are a must-have, and the style of orientation program must transition from lecture to interactive if companies are to keep the Gen Yers&amp;#39; interest and ensure that they retain the information necessary to deliver on the organization&amp;#39;s goals. On-the-job training must be specific, detailed and structured, with check-in and follow-up phases built into the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once they are onboard, the following tips for leading the Y-generation employees will help to create an environment that will retain these employees and ensure that they are motivated to be productive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Explain the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve them and ask their opinion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Treat them and others with respect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make time for orienting them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide supervision and structure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use a team concept&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Offer more and quality training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Offer mentoring&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recognize and reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generation Yers have yet to move into the workforce management ranks in big numbers. The youngest are in middle school, and the oldest have recently graduated from college. So while it is not yet known what type of mangers this generation will prove to be, some indications are that they will be more like their Boomer parents, exhibiting a consensual, people-focused style of management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leading the multi-generational workforce can be challenging and rewarding, providing opportunities to capitalize on diverse ideas and work styles that bring innovation to the organization. Great leaders will learn to tap into the resources of the multi-generational workforce, mitigate conflict and leverage the varied talents of each employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Important Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One caution I would give in studying this type of information is that there is a real danger of putting people in a box and stereotyping them based on the era in which they were born. Keep in mind that there are Traditionalists who love change and Baby Boomers who hate public recognition. I&amp;#39;ve said this many times before, and it has become my mantra for leaders: &amp;quot;The best strategy for leading your teams is to know each person as an individual.&amp;quot; However, this information can be very useful for understanding how to best motivate, identify and solve conflicts within, and hire for your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/Nlu_BxkQgKs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Help Workers Get What They Need</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you are like me, you&amp;#39;ve listened to the Rolling Stones over the years. Their contemporaries, the Beatles, became more artistic and lyrical as they evolved, but for driving party music, the Stones are still hard for any band to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I even heard the words to one of their songs quoted recently: &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t always get what you want.&amp;quot; This much I already knew, but what follows has a lot of meaning in continuous improvement: &amp;quot;But if you try sometime, you might find you get what you need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So many times in problem-solving work, you do all of the analysis with the really smart, expert people and come to what you truly believe is the right answer &amp;mdash; one that you really want to work. But then you find when you implement it, &amp;quot;You know, it just didn&amp;#39;t work,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;It just didn&amp;#39;t last,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nobody would buy into it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most people tend to get hung up on what they want rather than what they need. They want their elegant solution to work. They fall in love with it. For engineers, this is usually the technical solution. Having found that perfect solution, well, let&amp;#39;s not waste any time getting it in place. Forget all of that soft-skills stuff; just make people do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For some, change management is simply convincing people to do things that, for various reasons, they don&amp;#39;t seem to want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Others have talked of the frustrations and time consumed in hunting down and eliminating the wily, elusive, supposed single root cause, as opposed to just implementing some of the many solutions to various, fairly obvious contributing causes that just make things quickly better. This isn&amp;#39;t saying that structured analysis isn&amp;#39;t necessary, but rather that it&amp;#39;s not the biggest part of fixing or improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, because they tend to address fundamental issues, too many of the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; solutions become larger, which usually means expensive and time consuming. That&amp;#39;s also frustrating, as managers will usually push back at the thought of expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a problem that was aggravating and constantly frustrating plant personnel (as well as affecting productivity and quality) that could have been fixed for about $2,000. The solution had been developed with some help, but there was another, much more extensive engineering project in the works with a price tag of $80,000 that also would have taken care of that problem, among other things, so why spend the $2,000? Besides, adding in the fix on the small issue would help justify the big project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, after a number of months of management pushing back, the $80,000 project was abandoned. Sadly, the $2,000 project seemed to have been forgotten by then. Months of productivity and an opportunity to build some ownership were lost. It was their solution; they would have made it work. Instead, there was ongoing frustration at the needless waste and at being ignored. Of course, management again paid the price of being tagged with &amp;quot;too cheap to do the right thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The real trick in all of this is finding the way to &amp;quot;what we need.&amp;quot; So, what is missing? What do you have to &amp;quot;try sometime?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Well, how about listening to people? How about giving them the opportunities to make changes? How about helping them rather than telling them? Amazingly, people really know a lot about what the issues are and how to deal with them if asked and given the opportunity rather than being pushed aside while the experts deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implement a process that uses communication to build ownership. This doesn&amp;#39;t just happen, and you can&amp;#39;t just do it now and again when you have some time. It takes a routine, everyday, structured process that will go on forever. Issues and improvements are identified and discussed. Actions (including communication) are decided on, along with any necessary follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The daily, small-unit shift exchange meetings can be the most powerful way to get this to happen. It also takes the involvement of supervision, maintenance personnel and even engineers to get to what you need. Although people know what they need, they usually require some help getting there and are typically receptive to genuine attempts to assist them. Engineers and managers are there to help people find their way to the right answers and, in doing that, develop to their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, the right approach is not to get people to do things that they probably don&amp;#39;t want to do, but just to help them get to what they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/7nDUfrqwcW8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Art of Managing Layoffs: What to Do When Cuts are Unavoidable</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to layoffs, you must maintain the lines of open communication regarding the state of the company. The idea of keeping bad news from employees never works. They often hear through the grapevine or even the news media that the company is struggling. If you do not share this information with them, you are setting yourself up for more challenges than you bargained for as the workforce becomes discouraged and distrustful of leadership. Always remember, if you do not tell employees what is going on, they will make it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If, despite all of your best efforts, you cannot avoid layoffs, the following guidelines will help you to make the best of a very difficult time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate openly and honestly. Fill in the information gaps for your employees. Share market data and the state of the company&amp;rsquo;s profits, and keep them informed of possible future actions. Don&amp;rsquo;t create an environment of mistrust by lying or glossing over the real situation. It is almost impossible to regain trust once people know that you have lied to them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The manager must deliver the bad news directly to the individual(s) being laid off. As difficult as it is, never delegate the delivery of the layoff news. People tend to trust their manager first and the company second. Deliver the news personally and in private. Companies must allow time for the manager to have a one-on-one conversation with the person being let go. Be respectful and be prepared to listen. Give the person time to react. Everyone is different, and the manager should expect that they will encounter different reactions from different individuals. Some will be angry and vent, some will cry, some need time to reflect, and others may need facts and explanations, i.e., &amp;quot;How did you choose me over the other person?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide outplacement support. The manager should ask, &amp;quot;How can I help?&amp;quot; The employee may need help creating or updating his or her resume. Make sincere efforts to help them start moving toward a new future. These efforts will also show remaining employees that you are treating them as people, not as line items on a budget.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Support the survivors. Employees who survive the layoffs will begin to have doubts about their futures with the organization. They need up-front communication about how their jobs and goals may change. They will want to know what the future of the organization looks like from management&amp;rsquo;s perspective. Address each concern with rational discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The CEO should be visible and available to managers as well as employees. Prior to layoffs, he or she should provide coaching to the managers to assist them in delivering emotional news. The CEO has a powerful impact when he or she is willing to personally deliver a statement to the managers and employees regarding the necessity for these drastic actions and what he or she believes will be the impact on the company&amp;rsquo;s future. At the very least, the CEO should present managers with a written, prepared statement that they can share with all employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Saying that layoffs are not easy is an understatement. However, if done right, the organization can minimize the damages, ensuring that laid-off employees do not become ambassadors of ill will in the marketplace and that those employees who survive the layoff stay focused on the goal and the future of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/8ExjapJl19w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is emotional intelligence (EI)? If you ask this question, you will probably get many different and vague answers. The fact is that the concept of EI in the workplace and the connection between EI and leadership abilities is still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1990, Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer, who are considered the leading researchers on EI, have defined it as &amp;ldquo;the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one&amp;rsquo;s own and others&amp;rsquo; feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one&amp;rsquo;s thinking and actions.&amp;rdquo; In short, it is the mental ability to reason about emotions, and the capacity to improve thinking and gain better results by using emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Salovey and Mayer have created a model that identifies four factors of emotional intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The perception of emotions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to reason using emotions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to understand emotions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to manage emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These four factors refer to the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions. Salovey and Mayer propose that the four factors of their model are prioritized from the more basic psychological processes reflecting the relatively simple abilities of perceiving and expressing emotion to the more complex and conscious higher level reflecting the regulation of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is a growing belief that leaders and workers who demonstrate emotional intelligence can go a long way toward helping companies improve productivity and profitability. For example, the department head who is brilliant, has a high IQ and may be an expert in his field can get superior results if he also knows how to stay motivated under stress, motivate others, foster complex interpersonal relationships with employees and clients, and build teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Difference Between EI and IQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EI is the ability to use both your emotions and cognitive skills. EI competencies include empathy, intuition, creativity, flexibility, coping, stress management, and intrapersonal and interpersonal skills. In contrast, IQ is a number used to represent the apparent relative intelligence of a person. IQ is the measure of cognitive abilities only (e.g., the ability to learn, the skilled use of reason, the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one&amp;rsquo;s environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria such as tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider the following two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anna had a high IQ. She showed strong reasoning skills, was analytical and was focused on tasks. She learned new things quickly. However, she discounted how she and others were feeling. She was known to lose her temper if things did not go the way she expected or wanted. She found it difficult or impossible to relate to people who were not as smart as she was and lacked empathy for others. As a result, her ability to be effective in team situations was limited, even though her IQ was very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jose had a high EI. He demonstrated strong interpersonal and intrapersonal relationship skills, making friends easily and managing his emotions well. This made him highly effective in his work, even though there were others who had higher IQs. A key component of his success, his high EI allowed him to consider the emotional component of interactions, using both his cognitive abilities and his understanding of emotions. He was creative and flexible in the face of adversity and resilient after setbacks. As a result, he was able to influence and motivate people because he understood and took into consideration what mattered to them. His authenticity and integrity made him a natural leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Connection of EI to Effective Leadership and Organizational Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations are facing enormous challenges related to the downturn in the economic environment. Today, it is recognized that leadership skills are the most important asset of managers. At the heart of great leadership skills is the ability to develop and maintain interpersonal relationships. These skills include communication, active listening, managing conflict, inspiring and motivating individuals and groups, initiating and managing change, and collaborating and cooperating with other to reach shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The above skills are all traits that are shared by leaders with high EI. This then is the link that connects leaders with EI. Evidence is beginning to emerge that leaders with high emotional intelligence tend to demonstrate an open-mindedness that creates generous, people-oriented attributes, helping them to attract and keep great colleagues and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leader with high EI is more likely to have the ability to align personal and subordinate goals to accomplish company goals. In their book, &amp;quot;The Flight of the Buffalo,&amp;quot; James A. Belasco and Ralph C. Stayer cite four responsibilities that a leader must implement at all levels of an organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Transfer ownership for work to the people who do the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create an environment that is conducive to the transfer of ownership, a place where each person wants to be responsible for his or her own performance. This means that the leader must paint a clear picture of what great performance looks like for the company and the individual, focusing on performance factors; aligning organization systems, processes and structure to enable successful performance; engaging each individual&amp;rsquo;s heart, mind and hands in the business of the business; and energizing, motivating and inspiring people around the business focus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop individual capability and competence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create conditions in the organization that challenge every person to continually learn and grow in skills and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These four principles of leadership responsibility align personal and company goals through emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A study that shows a direct correlation between high EI within leadership ranks and bottom-line profitability was conducted by Harvard psychologist David McClelland in 1996. He studied a large global food and beverage company and found that division leaders with high EI outperformed yearly earnings by 20 percent, while those without high EI underperformed by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Danger to Leaders of Emotional Incompetence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developing emotional intelligence means acknowledging that emotions are always present in the workplace and then consciously doing something intelligent with the emotions. People tend to vary dramatically in the skills to which they use their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. This can be the difference between good leaders and bad leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The behaviors related to low or no EI can be devastating to the overall health of an organization. In 2002, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine ran a series of articles on why companies fail. In one such article titled, &amp;quot;Fearing the Boss More than the Competition,&amp;quot; the following was stated: &amp;quot;Sometimes CEOs don&amp;#39;t get the information they need to make informed decisions. The main reason, says Daniel Goleman, a psychologist and author of the book &amp;#39;Primal Leadership,&amp;#39; is that subordinates are afraid to tell them the truth. Even when a boss doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend to quash dissent, subtle signals &amp;ndash; a sour expression, a curt response &amp;ndash; can broadcast the message that bad news isn&amp;rsquo;t welcome. That&amp;#39;s why, according to a study by Goleman and two associates, higher-ranking executives are less likely to have an accurate assessment of their own performance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an executive and management coach, it has been my personal experience that challenges of the leaders with whom I work are seldom related to lack of technical skills but most often are related to emotional failings; they are too authoritarian, they cannot handle conflict, they generate fear rather than respect, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Role of Emotional Intelligence Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best leaders employ many tools and have the ability to be flexible in their leadership style, demonstrating situational leadership. There is no question that effective leadership determines the success of an organization. Organizations that place a strong focus on leaders who demonstrate high EI are able to see the results of high-impact leadership behaviors. High-impact leadership can instill trust and passionate commitment to the organization&amp;rsquo;s goals, mission and vision, especially during today&amp;rsquo;s turbulent times. It is this commitment that drives success and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/RYCaILm6wOM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>6 Elements of a Good Job Description</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A successful training program is built from clear and comprehensive job descriptions that define the expected tasks to be performed by the employee and the expected behaviors to be demonstrated by the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are reluctant to write job descriptions for fear that employees will use the document as a way to avoid taking on additional responsibilities or refuse to get involved in special projects. In actuality, a detailed job description provides the employee with important information that enables him or her to quickly acclimate to a new environment by clearly and precisely stating the expectations for task delivery and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The elements of a good job description are briefly outlined below. While not all inclusive, these six elements are a good place to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Task functions and responsibilities &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; Clearly delineate all job functions and responsibilities as they relate to the performance of the employees duties. This would include technical aspects of the position, supervisory or managerial responsibilities (if applicable), communication skills and experience requirements, and back-up functions such as &amp;quot;other functions as deemed necessary by circumstances.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Performance standards &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; Indicate productivity and quality standards required for the individual to be successful in his or her new role.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Job-related skills &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; List the level of skill, knowledge, experience and capability demanded by the job, including any technical skills; physical requirements such as repeated lifting, pulling or pushing and physical exams that must be passed prior to qualifying for the position; communication skills such as written, verbal and language requirements; and interpersonal skills such as customer interaction, strong team player skills and the ability to work harmoniously with a diverse workforce. If the job requires computer skills, indicate the hardware and software that the employee will be using and the minimal skill level and/or experience required with the hardware or software.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Scope and limits of authority &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Outline the areas of responsibility assigned to each person, including where duties may overlap and who is ultimately responsible for the finished product or service. Also, specifically describe the level of authority the person has over other people, the function or the product.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Management expectations &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It is impossible to get results unless you spell them out. These should include expectations for availability such as overtime, nights, weekends, holidays, etc.; flexibility in scheduling regarding off days; restrictions on vacation time; policies and accountabilities for tardiness and absenteeism; and expected employee behaviors regarding interaction with peers, customers, vendors, managers and others.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Relationships &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Clarify the reporting structure for each department or division, stating to whom the employee reports or who reports to the employee, if applicable. Also, if team or group projects are required, give an example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you make the job description available to the potential employee during the application process prior to the interview or present it during the interview, the employee should have ample time to review and reflect on the job requirements on which he or she will be expected to deliver. The preferred method is to make the job description available with the application. This gives the applicant enough time to formulate questions that he or she may want to ask during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most importantly, once you have made the job offer, have the new employee sign the job description. This allows you to hold the employee accountable for delivering on all aspects of the job and avoid the &amp;quot;that wasn&amp;#39;t in my job description&amp;quot; scenario. If you ultimately hire the person, the signed job description is placed in his or her personnel file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/tqtVD5T1TEg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Resolve Workplace Conflict</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Conflict in the workplace seems to be a fact of life. We&amp;#39;ve all seen situations where different people with different goals and needs have come into conflict. And, we&amp;#39;ve all seen the often-intense personal animosity that can result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organization leaders are responsible for creating a work environment that enables people to thrive. If turf wars, disagreements and differences of opinion escalate into conflict, you must intervene immediately. Not intervening is not an option if you value your organization and your positive culture. In conflict-ridden situations, your mediation skill and interventions are critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many cases, effective conflict resolution skills can make the difference between positive and negative outcomes. The good news is that by resolving conflict successfully, you can solve many of the problems that it has brought to the surface, as well as gain benefits that you might not at first expect, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Increased understanding: &lt;/strong&gt;The discussion needed to resolve conflict expands people&amp;#39;s awareness of the situation, giving them an insight into how they can achieve their own goals without undermining those of other people;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Increased group cohesion: &lt;/strong&gt;When conflict is resolved effectively, team members can develop stronger mutual respect and a renewed faith in their ability to work together; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Improved self-knowledge: &lt;/strong&gt;Conflict pushes individuals to examine their goals in close detail, helping them understand the things that are most important to them, sharpening their focus and enhancing their effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if conflict is handled ineffectively or if conflict is ignored, the results can be damaging. Conflicting goals can quickly turn into personal dislike, teamwork breaks down, and talent is wasted as people disengage from their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conflict within the workplace can result in a vicious downward spiral of negativity and recrimination. If you&amp;#39;re to keep your team or organization working effectively, you need to stop this downward spiral as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Susan M. Heathfield says in her conflict resolution article for About.com, &amp;quot;Do not believe, for even a moment, the only people who are affected by the conflict are the participants. Everyone in your office and every employee with whom the conflicting employees interact are affected by the stress. People feel as if they are walking on egg shells in the presence of the antagonists. This contributes to the creation of a hostile work environment for other employees. In worst-case scenarios, your organization members take sides, and your organization is divided.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working Dynamics reports the following statistics that reflect the cost of conflict in organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Thirty to 42 percent of managers&amp;#39; time is spent reaching agreement with others when conflicts occur (Watson, C. and Hoffman, R., &amp;quot;Managers as Negotiators,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Leadership Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; 7 (1) 1996).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is estimated that more than 65 percent of performance problems result from strained relationships between employees, not from deficits in individual employees&amp;#39; skill or motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It is estimated that sexual harassment claims alone are costing each Fortune 500 company $6.7 million per year, with costs for smaller companies being proportionately burdensome.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recent studies find that more than two-thirds of managers spend more than 10 percent of their time handling workplace conflict, and 44 percent of managers spend more than 20 percent of their time in conflict-related issues.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A number of surveys indicate that people in all occupations report the most uncomfortable, stress-producing parts of their jobs are the interpersonal conflicts that they experience on a daily basis between themselves and co-workers or supervisors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are a few of the most common reasons for workplace conflict:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Interpersonal Conflict &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This conflict is usually caused by opposing personalities or personality clashes that can be caused by many factors such as jealousy, envy or even something as simple as a personal dislike of one person for another. Prejudices based on religious, racial or sexual differences also lead to interpersonal conflict. Often, interpersonal conflict creates gossip that not only perpetuates the conflict between the direct parties involved, but can also affect others on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Structural Conflict &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This is when departments have different needs and wants, and are not able to compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Differing Goals &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This is when departments have differing goals, and each department is working independently to achieve their goals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Mutual Dependence of Departments &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This is when two departments are dependent on each other, and the failure of either department affects the other.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Role Dissatisfaction &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; Certain departments or groups may feel that they are not receiving enough recognition or status. This may generate conflict between departments, groups or individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Dependence on Common Resources &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; When two departments depend on common and scarce resources, conflict can evolve between departments and/or individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Communication Barriers &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; This often occurs in organizations that have branch offices due to the geographic separation that makes consistent and timely communication possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supervisors and managers who are experiencing conflict within their areas must always consider assessing their possible responsibilities in creating or enabling workplace conflict. Always ask, &amp;quot;What about the work situation is causing these staff members to fail?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The workplace conflict may appear to be strictly interpersonal; however, it is important to candidly ask yourself if it is possible that workplace conditions were the catalyst or the enabler. Maybe a supervisor ignored the signs of budding conflict. People and departments may have been set up to compete for rewards and/or recognition. Perhaps the feeling is that the awards and recognition are distributed unfairly by management. Getting to the root cause of the conflict is critical in mediating and solving the conflict situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The single biggest mistake a supervisor or manager can make is to avoid the conflict, hoping it will go away. It never does! If the conflict appears to have died down on its own, the supervisor or manager may be tempted to believe that it has resolved itself. Conflict does not resolve itself! Invariably, it will rear its ugly head whenever stress increases or a new disagreement occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, when conflict reappears, it is more volatile and more debilitating to the organization than it was initially. An unresolved conflict or interpersonal disagreement festers just under the surface in the work environment. It rises to the surface whenever enabled, and always at the worst possible moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a little training, the manager in most cases is quite capable of facilitating conflict resolution sessions. However, if the conflict has escalated to a highly volatile state, it is recommended that a third impartial party attend the session to ensure objectivity and to document dialogue and agreements. The third party may be a human resources representative or another manager from a department that operates separately from the department experiencing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following are three strategies for conflict resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Use Active Listening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During conflict situations, the parties involved tend to spend most of their time talking rather than listening. While each person is speaking, the other person is spending his or her time formulating his or her rebuttal. Often, people judge another&amp;#39;s statement based on their own point of view or values, without considering the other person&amp;#39;s perspective. As a result, people hear what they want to hear rather than what the speaker intended to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Emotions also come into play. Once a conflict has escalated emotionally, it is very difficult to listen objectively. It is the manager&amp;#39;s job as mediator to listen objectively to each side, ensure that both or all parties are listening, and that each person has a chance to state his or her side of the situation. The manager can accomplish this by asking open-ended questions, showing empathy for both sides, using feedback to reinforce what you have heard, keeping emotions under control and being non-judgmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Deal with Conflict Collaboratively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Get all involved parties in a neutral/private environment to facilitate conflict resolution. Ask each participant to provide a written statement in advance describing the situation in his or her own words. These statements will give the mediating manager insight into the possible causes of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the session, give each party a chance to tell his or her side of the situation without interruption. Analyze the problem from each person&amp;rsquo;s perspective and collaboratively develop solutions. Agree to meet in the future to check on the progress of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Clearly State Expectations for Future Behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clearly describe the damage to the organization as a result of employee conflict and the consequences for future inappropriate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to remember that the manager&amp;#39;s role in conflict resolution is that of mediator. The manager must remain impartial and cannot enter into conflict resolution if he or she has preconceived opinions or ideas about who is right or wrong in the situation. If the manager finds that he or she cannot be impartial, that person should assign the task of the conflict resolution session to a third impartial party such as a human resources manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mediating a conflict is challenging, but as a manager or supervisor, the role of mediator comes with your territory. Your willingness to appropriately intervene sets the stage for your own success. You craft a work environment that enables the success of the people who work there. I believe you can learn to do it. Conflict mediation is an example of &amp;quot;practice makes perfect.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/3ULI-W94z9k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Develop Better Managers by Coaching</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Performance coaching is not about disciplinary action, nor is it about accountability (although it may promote accountability in the long term). It is really about leadership development &amp;mdash; teaching your team of supervisors, managers and leaders the skills and behaviors that are necessary to perform their jobs as efficiently as possible in order to get the best results for themselves and the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Performance coaching is not about telling your management team what to do; it is about telling them how to get the best results from their people and processes. If you are experiencing mediocre productivity, ongoing conflict or high turnover, you should look first at your management team. They are the root cause for success and failure. There is an old Chinese proverb that says, &amp;quot;For every hundred men hacking away at the branches of a diseased tree, only one will stoop to inspect the roots.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is surprising to me the number of managers and executives I meet who have no idea how to conduct performance coaching sessions. While facilitating an executive coaching session with a vice president, she told me that she had continually written her managers up and that they continued to deliver substandard performance. Her frustration was evident, but writing people up is self-defeating when you have not performed due diligence in the supervisor&amp;#39;s or manager&amp;#39;s performance training. It does not teach the skills the employee or manager needs to move forward. It only punishes them for making mistakes and not performing up to expected standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most supervisors and managers want to do a good job, but many do not have the skills to deal with the complicated workforce issues prevalent in today&amp;#39;s organizations. Many supervisors and managers are learning as they go. This process is slow, ineffective and costly to organizations, as supervisors and managers bungle their way through each day, trying to do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To effectively conduct performance coaching sessions, you must first understand the root cause of poor performance. Performance is a function of both ability and motivation. For example, someone with 100-percent motivation and 75-percent ability can achieve good to above average performance. However, someone with 25-percent ability will most likely not be able to perform to expected standards no matter how highly motivated they are to succeed. In the latter case, you will have to identify a strategic plan to provide this person with the skills he or she needs to succeed, or assess whether he or she is in the right position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Key signs that low ability may be the root cause of poor performance include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evidence of strong effort despite poor performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of improvement over time despite ongoing coaching and training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Performance Coaching for Management Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching to develop your management team allows leaders to leverage the organization&amp;#39;s human capital, creating a competitive advantage. Supervisors and managers have a direct impact on how employees feel about working for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once the economy turns around, disgruntled employees will certainly begin to consider a job change,&amp;quot; said Lori Dernavich, a business advisor on workplace performance solutions and founder of Lori Dernavich LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching and counseling for management development ranges from helping poor performers improve to capitalizing on high-potential supervisors and managers by keeping them challenged and encouraging them to continuously improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching is not a one-way street. Both the leader and the supervisor or manager share the responsibility for positive results. Highly effective performance coaches have the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Base the coaching relationship on trust&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are optimists about human nature&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Give people opportunities to take risks and learn from their mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Practice effective listening skills&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speak candidly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Encourage personal accountability and ownership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Know their strengths and weaknesses and continually strive to leverage strengths and overcome weaknesses&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are continuous learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are three key strategies for effective performance coaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Create a Culture of Involvement and Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tactics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide the knowledge, skills, tools, resources and education to ensure the supervisor&amp;#39;s or manager&amp;#39;s success.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Share the vision, mission and business objectives, ensuring that they understand where they fit in to the big picture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set clear standards for results and behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reward and recognize results and behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Provide Challenging Assignments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tactics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assess the supervisor&amp;#39;s or manager&amp;#39;s abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make assignments that align with their abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide clear direction and expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove roadblocks and barriers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Trust them to accomplish the task.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reward and recognize effort and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Provide Ongoing Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tactics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide constructive criticism. Meet monthly to discuss the supervisor&amp;#39;s or manager&amp;#39;s progress and areas where improvement is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Document the monthly conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove barriers and roadblocks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide tools and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use effective listening and feedback skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Coaches as Mentors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am frequently asked about the difference between coaches and mentors. It is true that great coaches often become dedicated mentors. The definition of a mentor is: &amp;quot;A person who gives another person the benefit of his or her years of experience and/or education. This is experience that is shared in such a way that the mentor helps to develop a mentee&amp;#39;s skills and abilities, benefiting the mentee and the organization.&amp;quot; However, there are clear differences between a coach and a mentor. Below is a quick guide to mentoring for improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Why Mentoring is Different than Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coaching is not the same as mentoring. Mentoring is concerned with the development of the whole person and driven by the person&amp;#39;s own work/life goals. It is usually unstructured and informal. Coaching is much more about achieving specific objectives in a particular way. Coaching is also more formal and more structured, usually around a coaching process or methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, mentoring is less skill-based and more of a relationship-based process. A good mentoring relationship is identified by the willingness and capability of both parties to ask questions, challenge assumptions and disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mentor is far less likely to have a direct-line relationship with the mentee, and in a mentoring relationship, this distance is desirable. Mentoring is rarely a critical part of an individual&amp;#39;s job role but rather an extra element that rewards the mentor with fresh thinking as well as the opportunity to transfer knowledge and experience to a less experienced colleague, peer or employee. If you are interested in becoming a mentor, the following tips may prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tips for Effective Mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentee has no direct-line reporting to the mentor. This fosters trust, and the mentee feels more comfortable in sharing uncertainties about his or her abilities, creating free-flowing, open communication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentor/mentee relationship is mutually satisfying. The mentor gets the satisfaction of watching someone grow as a result of his or her insights. The mentee gains a feeling of being valued, receiving beneficial direction and attention from someone who is respected and admired.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The intensity of the relationship is matched. It is taking up actual and mental time in proportions with which both people are comfortable. This time commitment is flexible as the mentee&amp;#39;s needs change (e.g., there may be several meetings in a short period of time during a very challenging period, then none for months).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At any time, either party can stop the relationship and the mentoring process. There is no obligation for continuance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentee is not a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;. It is not a teacher-pupil relationship, nor does the mentee (necessarily) have the patronage of the mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An effective mentor gives wise counsel, and the mentee feels comfortable speaking on issues that may be sensitive. Once this trust is developed, the mentor can give advice or assist with tough recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The mentor is not mentoring two people at the same time who have a close working relationship. Discretion and confidentiality are paramount. The rules of engagement are stated up front with an agreement between the mentor and the mentee on who should be aware of the mentoring relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The obligation for continuing is two-sided. When the mentor feels he or she has value to add and the mentee is getting something from the relationship, the mentoring may go on indefinitely. Otherwise, either side can end it without justification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mentoring programs are about guidance and facilitation rather than formal training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Becoming a mentor is a personal choice. Learning to effectively provide performance coaching is a necessary skill for retaining top talent within the management and front-line employee ranks. It is critical that leadership within organizations do everything in their power to give management the skills they need to successfully get results through people and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/xaap1DMKaNY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Are You a Leader or a Manager?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders who lead by example are mentors and role models, building business results through relationships and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before delving into the topic of the leadership example, it may be helpful to define leaders and leadership. Beginning with the root word of lead, Webster&amp;#39;s Dictionary defines lead as &amp;quot;to guide and conduct; to govern; to precede.&amp;quot; Also from Webster&amp;#39;s, a leader is defined as &amp;quot;one who leads; a guide; a captain; a head of party.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In contrast, the definition of manage is &amp;quot;to wield; to direct; to conduct or minister; to have under command; to treat with judgment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simply put: Managers manage processes, and leaders inspire and motivate others to accomplish goals. Ask yourself, which definition applies to you? Are you a leader or a manager? Which would you rather be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Great leaders lead by example, demonstrating their values through their actions. These leaders build relationships by mentoring and providing guidance, creating cohesive teams and earning the loyalty of their employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many managers in organizations across the country yet very few leaders. How does this happen? It happens because most organizations still use an old, outdated method for hiring into and promoting people from within the organization. That method is to choose people who are very good at what they do, without consideration as to whether they can motivate and inspire people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Managers are tactical, hands-on personalities. There is no argument that managers can achieve results. However, the results are almost always short-term results. People will do what they are told for many reasons, such as fear of losing their job, lack of education or experience making him or her unwilling to argue (even if they feel the manager is wrong), or apathy toward the company and its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders provide guidance. They motivate and inspire people to take action. In this way, leaders achieve long-term results through a productive, happy workforce. There are many strategies used by leaders to achieve these results. The behavior that has the most powerful impact on employees, customers and vendors is leading by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next time you have a staff meeting, try this exercise. Ask everyone who has integrity to raise his or her hand. You will probably see all hands raised. Next, ask them to raise their hand if everyone that they work with has integrity. You will see many less hands. Why is this? As people, it is natural that we judge ourselves based on our intentions, while others judge us based on our behaviors. So while most people intend to always have integrity and to do the right things, the fact of the matter is that it does not always happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders who lead by example are those exceptional individuals who, more often than not, do the right things. They demonstrate the right behaviors and follow through on promises and commitments. In addition, they act as role models and mentors, are great listeners, and do not live by the adage, &amp;quot;Do as I say, not as I do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It has been said that leaders who lead by example walk the talk, but what does this mean? Paul Fireman, past chairman of Reebok International, made a promise that Reebok would overtake its main competitor, Nike, in two years. To fulfill this promise, he did not threaten or bribe the people who worked for him. He motivated his employees by showing them that he was willing to take risks, encouraging them to take risks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He told them that he would do whatever it took to reach this goal. He then followed through on that promise by spending the money to build an innovative product-development program and hiring the world&amp;#39;s top sports figures as spokespeople. Fireman talked and walked the new Reebok vision 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;You need to build an enrollment,&amp;quot; Fireman said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think you can dictate that to people. I don&amp;#39;t think you can tell people to go, march, do this. You&amp;#39;ve got to make them want to ride along. It&amp;#39;s a leader&amp;#39;s job to foster those feelings. We are in this together. We are part of a team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders who lead by example are courageous. You can recognize courageous leaders by looking for the following characteristics and behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They provide information, encourage their employees to make decisions that they support and do not take credit for the employees&amp;#39; successful ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They are continually coaching, providing honest and direct feedback, and supporting their employees. Under these circumstances, employees will build skills and rely less on the leader.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They empower employees and provide opportunities for greater responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They recognize employees&amp;#39; problem-solving actions and encourage risk-taking, rewarding the employee for the effort as well as the results.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They face conflict and confrontation on tough issues and fight the right battles for employees, customers and the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		They do what they say they will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Great listening skills characterize leaders who lead by example. This is different than saying they have an open-door policy. Leaders should be willing to listen to employees&amp;#39; concerns and ideas and seriously consider implementing their ideas whenever possible. They also must take complaints seriously and take the time to investigate claims of ill treatment or inappropriate behavior on the part of other leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;#39;s business world, there are many distractions. Consider this example: An employee comes into your office and states that he needs to speak to you. Immediately, you know it&amp;#39;s serious. You try to do all the right things. You put down your pen, forward your phone calls and give the employee your attention, yet it is hard to ignore the ding of e-mail that just arrived. The phone rings three times before switching to voice-mail. Others pop their heads in periodically to ask a quick question. You hear an argument in the hall. How do you turn off all of this? It is not easy, but blind motivational speaker David DeNotaris has some advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since he does not have the advantage of observing body language and facial expressions while listening, DeNotaris has learned to listen, as he says, &amp;quot;like a blind man.&amp;quot; In other words, he believes that everyone can learn to listen with the heart rather than the head. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When you are listening with your head, you&amp;#39;re collecting facts and thinking, &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;d better prepare something to say when this person is done speaking,&amp;#39;&amp;quot; says DeNotaris. &amp;quot;But when you listen with the heart, you show interest in the other person&amp;#39;s feelings &amp;ndash; not your own reputation. You find out what the other person wants and needs, and then you can speak in a way that meets those needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning to be a leader who leads by example is not an easy task, especially with the distractions and stress of the business environment today. Many times in coaching sessions, leaders have said they do not have any idea where to start. Try these quick activities to identify the characteristics of a person who leads by example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify at least one person who was or is a role model for you as a leader. This person may have been a teacher, your parents, a religious figure, an athlete or a boss, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make a list of the things that they did or said that inspired your loyalty and motivated you to succeed. What characteristics and behaviors did they demonstrate that you would like to exhibit to others?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How will you do this?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What behaviors or characteristics do you need to change to be more like the role model who influenced you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders who lead by example are mentors, willing to give of themselves to promote the growth and development of others. These leaders get to know their employees and build relationships that last a lifetime. They learn employees&amp;#39; names, know about their families, and take the time to understand what motivates and inspires them. Most importantly, they practice the behaviors that motivate and inspire others. These leaders demonstrate strong ethics and moral behavior in their business and personal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In short, leaders who lead by example are the leaders who are competent and drive business results for the organization while building relationships with employees, customers and vendors. These are the most effective people in an organization. Unfortunately, these are also the most difficult people to find. When you find one, you must do whatever it takes to keep them in the organization, for they will take your business to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/8BA4GTsMPWk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Use Incentives to Reduce Waste</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Waste is seen in many different forms in manufacturing, and much of these wastes can be reduced or eliminated through incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is no mystery that money talks, especially when trying to motivate a change in culture. You can provoke change by just making new policy and enforcing it with effectiveness. While fear can be a great motivator, I think incentives are a far more effective approach. There is reward for good behavior instead of punishment for bad behavior. Now I am not about to tell you to make a reward for everything or that this is the best method, but it can be very effective, especially in establishing a culture of waste reduction. Awards and other incentives can be a positive boost, but money always seems to be the most effective, particularly in a tough economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After leaving the U.S. Navy, I was employed at a ductile iron foundry as a maintenance supervisor. I was accustomed to a culture that rewarded good work with medals and certificates. This did motivate people to do a good job, and for the most part, it was an individual basis. The foundry used monetary bonuses to create and maintain a culture, and it worked to great success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two bonuses I will talk about dealt with safety and scrap. Both of these bonuses were received by everyone plant-wide, so it was definitely a cultural motivator. The bonuses were based on staying below a certain threshold. The lower the company was below the threshold, the more it paid in bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now the bonuses were not the only tools used to keep the levels down, but they were definitely a motivator to attain that goal. Everyone had a vested interest in performance, and they were not afraid to point out deficiencies that needed to be corrected, even with management. This was not an atmosphere where employees went and told on others. Instead, they would stop and deal with the problem directly because there was an incentive to correct the deficiencies. The results were an incredibly low safety-incident rate compared to industry standards and a very low scrap rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not suggesting that every company should go out and put these bonuses in place. What I am telling you is to be creative on how to reduce waste. Find incentives that motivate the culture in the direction you want to go. This kind of approach can also be effective in specific departments or operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/bl_QdvQoAvI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Foster a Culture of Involvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Building a culture of involvement that includes self-managed work teams is undoubtedly the most challenging of all leadership endeavors, but it is also the most rewarding. Great leaders involve employees from all levels in the business operations. By creating an environment of trust and openness and developing a culture of risk-taking, leaders are able to turn over the responsibility of the daily operations to the employees. These leaders recognize the need and take active steps to produce ownership within the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key here is involvement, and the critical question is: &amp;quot;How do you involve employees and motivate them to take ownership?&amp;quot; The best companies know that employees who feel involved in the business feel trusted. This trust helps to create a sense of ownership. A sense of ownership enables employees to empower themselves, making them happier, more fulfilled, productive and loyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to note that you cannot empower employees. However, you can provide them with the environment, the tools and the resources to empower themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that the process of involvement is tricky. It takes work, and all supervisors, managers and leaders must be on board. There must be consistency in the rollout, support and accountability processes. For most organizations, especially manufacturing organizations, the level of involvement is very low, if not non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deciding to implement a process of involvement is about making dramatic cultural change. You will face resistance. The roadblocks to involvement include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Lack of trust &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;Most employees will be suspicious of a leadership team that has, in the minds of its members, suddenly decided to involve them, ask their advice and listen to their ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Fear &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Employees will quickly realize that they will be required to learn new skills and perform additional responsibilities. They will worry about what happens if they make a mistake (will they be disciplined or lose their jobs?) or if they are not able to learn the new skills (will they lose their jobs, be moved to less desirable positions or be forced to take a pay cut?).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Resentment &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Employees may resent taking on more responsibility, especially with tasks that they perceive to be management&amp;#39;s responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the challenges and frustrations during the process, creating a culture of involvement is worth the investment. When I worked for Textile Services (Disney&amp;#39;s laundries), I was fortunate to have been a member of a committee that changed the laundry operations from a typical, autocratic, authoritarian operation to one of involvement and self-managed work teams. During the process, we thought often of giving up, but in the end the perseverance paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of one year, we saw light at the end of the tunnel. Within the next two to three years, we managed to change the culture, despite the fact that more than 40 percent of the workforce had tenure of 20 to 25 years. When I left Disney three years ago, the culture of involvement was still firmly in place and had been the mode of operation for their business for more than 12 years. The benefits realized from directly involving the employees in all levels of the business were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Turnover was reduced from 60 percent to an average of 5 percent annually.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Prior to the cultural change, the plant ran with four managers per shift, for a total of eight managers per day. This number was reduced to one manager per shift, for a total of two per day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On the annual survey, more than 80 percent of the employees stated that they were very proud to say that they worked for Textile Services.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The customer survey ratings improved dramatically to more than 80 percent satisfaction with all aspects of customer service.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Outsourcing was no longer a threat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5 Tactics for Creating a Culture of Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Below are the tactics that we used at Textile Services to create a culture of involvement within the laundry operations. They should be considered guidelines and a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 1: &lt;/strong&gt;Communicate the vision and ensure everyone is on the same page, working toward a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is imperative that all employees buy into the vision if they are going to assist in the execution of the vision. In most cases, they are not paid more to get involved. Therefore, it is critical that the benefits to the employees are clearly articulated by leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the roadblocks at Textile Services in accomplishing this goal was the diversity of the employee base. Employees in the laundries represented 15 countries and spoke seven languages, many of them speaking no English whatsoever. Obviously, communicating the vision in English alone was not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The committee settled on a more creative method of communication. They scheduled several sessions where employees were released from their positions for approximately one hour. The vision and the mission were presented to all employees in groups of 30 to 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The laundry leadership team communicated this important message in English with bilingual translators in the room representing every group. The leaders demonstrated the principles of great service through mini-plays or skits. Employees were encouraged to get involved by giving feedback and asking questions at the end of the session, ensuring clarity of the message and expectations of the employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every employee was required to attend one of the scheduled sessions. For those who were not able to attend due to extenuating circumstances, leaders were required to meet one-on-one with these employees to communicate the key message points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results were surprising. The vast majority of employees was on board and excited about the future. This led to an immediate increase in productivity and a buzz of excitement in the plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Create a culture of trust by giving employees the knowledge, skills, tools, resources and parameters to make good decisions, ensuring that they will successfully deliver on the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Providing this level of skill and knowledge can be accomplished in many ways. Informally, daily huddles can be held to share information critical to the day&amp;#39;s work. An article in the April 2006 issue of &lt;em&gt;Business 2.0&lt;/em&gt; magazine highlighted how UPS starts each day with a three-minute huddle to keep 220,000 drivers and package handlers on time. These meetings ensure that employees are informed of company announcements, local traffic conditions, customer complaints and even a daily safety tip. The strict 180-second time limit helps enforce the company focus of punctuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More formally, monthly meetings and training sessions that facilitate two-way conversations are valuable ways to involve employees. For those employees who may not be comfortable sharing information in a group setting, one-on-one conversations are good ways to get people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Providing tools and resources is critical in supporting self-directed teams. You must determine which tools and resources are necessary for the employees to experience success in their new roles. These tools and resources could be computer training, English-speaking classes, effective communication classes, training for implementing new processes or updated standard operating procedure (SOP) manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 3: &lt;/strong&gt;Involve employees in the process for budgeting financial results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once employees understand the process for budgeting productivity, purchasing supplies, etc., they are more likely to understand their impact on the budget. However, it is not enough to explain the process. To build trust and commitment toward delivering on the goals of the organization, employees should be involved in creating the budget goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some managers would argue that employees cannot possibly create budget goals. Although it may be true that some employees have limited education and cannot comprehend the complicated process of budgeting, only by having a hands-on experience will employees understand their role in making the business successful. They will realize that it is they, the frontline employees, whose primary interaction with the customer has the true ability to impact the customer experience. Employees who are involved in creating the budget will understand their value and importance to the organization. They now have a sense of control over their own destinies, making the connection that success for the organization means success for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 4: &lt;/strong&gt;Develop training that creates interaction within departments and with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Great training is about more than a strong on-the-job (OJT) training program. Certainly nothing replaces a good OJT program, but consider enhancing it with a cross-utilization or job-shadow program. This type of training builds camaraderie, relationships and empathy for one another&amp;#39;s positions. It is especially helpful in situations where the success of one department is reliant on the success of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 5: &lt;/strong&gt;Build continuous improvement into every step of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Teach employees the process for measuring operational efficiencies and challenges, and involve them in the continuous improvement process by asking for their opinions and ideas. This is how you leverage the talent, knowledge and experience of your employees. No one knows better than the frontline employees what is and isn&amp;#39;t working. They understand where you can gain operational efficiencies to impact the business in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A word of caution: The mistake that many managers make is that they ask but do not act, saying things like: &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t do that,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t have the money for that,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been tried before, and it didn&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The leader&amp;#39;s place in this process is to clearly delineate the parameters, provide tools and knowledge, remove roadblocks, and support the employees in their efforts. This means that leaders must implement employee ideas as often as possible. Supporting the employee by implementing their ideas, even if they seem small and insignificant, builds the leader&amp;#39;s credibility and relationships for future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Undoubtedly, you will not be able to implement all employee ideas, but what you must do is acknowledge the employee for trying to improve the operation and explain why the idea cannot be implemented. If you do not at least acknowledge employees for their efforts, you may never receive another idea from them, but the most damaging result will be the loss of credibility by the leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reward and recognition is a critical step in the process of continuous improvement and does not have to cost a lot of money. Employees who feel valued are more likely to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Creating a culture of trust is hard work and means taking risks. Each day, you face the risk that employees will make bad decisions and that those decisions will cost the company money. Taking the time to provide the skills, knowledge, tools and training will not eliminate the risks but will minimize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some employees will carry their sense of involvement to the extreme, despite your best efforts to communicate the parameters. It will be necessary for you to coach and counsel these employees. If they insist on working outside the stated parameters, you may need to take some level of disciplinary action. However, experience has shown that these employees are the exception to the rule and that the benefits far outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/0pp-BMT4XMg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Motivate Employees by Valuing Their Input</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It is usually assumed that only 20 percent of employees in an organization are truly devoted and willing to go above and beyond requirements. In this assumption, the remaining 80 percent of the employees just want to come to work, do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While there are employees who just want to do the minimum no matter what you do to motivate them, I personally do not and cannot believe that only 20 percent are devoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Speaking from my own experience, I was in the assumed 20 percent seven years ago when I was on the assembly line. I really was not concerned about the organization, its direction or its atmosphere. I just wanted to come to work and collect a paycheck at the end of the week. I was not inspired and was a victim of the daily grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This viewpoint quickly changed direction when my assembly manager started valuing my opinions on improvement ideas. A light switch was turned on. Almost instantaneously, I was motivated and energized. This eventually led to me becoming a lean change agent and earning a promotion to lean engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was not challenging for my assembly manager to motivate me. I was given the freedom to use my imagination and try unique, even &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; ideas. This freedom made my job exciting, and I was able to save the company plenty of money and even implement cultural tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe this would work for most people because these elements are in Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy of needs. Individuals need to flex their mental muscle, be part of a successful team and be recognized for the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This might be all it takes to engage individuals. It is simple and effective. People generally react positively to respect because it elevates their esteem. High esteem generates high morale, and high morale spawns overachievers. Positivity, caring and valuing the employees&amp;rsquo; input to business decisions will entwine them deep into the organization, and this will result in a higher percentage of organizational devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As mentioned earlier, I do not believe that 80 percent of the workforce is preordained to become mediocre zombies. In fact, I believe if organizational leaders accept this as true, they grow to become mediocre zombies themselves. The light switch can be flipped in everyone. The challenge lies in how to flip it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/Anluj6Endw8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Keys to Better Workplace Communication</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Corporate leaders are trained in economics, strategy and a variety of other business skills. Few are trained in communication, yet experts agree that communication is one of the most important skills leaders should have on their list of competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To ensure successful communications within your organization, it is best to start with the very basics: your knowledge of verbal and non-verbal communications. In the workplace, these types of communications are continually exchanged, oftentimes without much planning or even the thought that such communications are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Importance of Non-Verbal Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A famous study by Albert Mehrabian found that non-verbal language makes up 55 percent of how we communicate in face-to-face interactions. He also concluded that we communicate as much as 38 percent of our message through our voice (tone, pitch and so on), with as little as 7 percent through the words we actually say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Understanding and recognizing the signs and signals that make up this 55 percent can help you when you communicate with others. There are times when we send mixed messages &amp;ndash; we say one thing yet our body language reveals something different. This non-verbal language affects how we act and react to others, how they react to us, and whether we gain and maintain credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, it&amp;rsquo;s not always just what you say but how you &amp;ldquo;say&amp;rdquo; it, taking into account your eyes, your posture, your overall body language, the voice in which you offer the exchange and even your appearance at the time the communication is exchanged. In verbal communication, an active dialogue is engaged with the use of words. At the same time, non-verbal communication takes place, relying on non-verbal cues, such as gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, even clothing and personal space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Non-verbal cues are very powerful, making it crucial that you pay attention to your actions as well as the non-verbal cues of those around you. If during your meeting, participants begin to doodle or chat among themselves, they are no longer paying attention to you. Your message has become boring, or your delivery is no longer engaging. When I was a business program facilitator at the Disney Institute, I had a friend who used to say, &amp;ldquo;Watch the audience. If they&amp;rsquo;re bored, you&amp;rsquo;re boring them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While eye contact, facial expressions, posture, gestures, clothing and space are obvious non-verbal communication cues, others strongly influence interpretation of messages, including how the message is delivered. This means paying close attention to your tone of voice, even your voice&amp;rsquo;s overall loudness and pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be mindful of your own non-verbal cues as well as the non-verbal cues of those around you. Keep your messages short and concise. This means preparing in advance whenever possible. For the impromptu meeting, it means thinking before you speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Barriers to Effective Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Barriers can arise at any stage of the communication process. When communication is failing, it is of primary importance to identify where the causes for failure are within the communication process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a few minutes to think about the barriers to effective communication in your organization, division or department. Some of the most common barriers that I hear when working with leaders in organizations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lack of time to communicate effectively&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Staff is spread geographically&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Don&amp;rsquo;t have the tools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Language barriers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ethnic and cultural barriers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Educational differences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Differences in experience of the workforce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In reality, all barriers to effective communication fall into three broad categories. These categories are related to the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		External Environment &amp;mdash; This would include the space in which you are communicating, the communication tools used (handouts, PowerPoint or no tools used), the method of communication (written, verbal, meetings, one-on-one, etc.) and the communication as it relates to your corporate culture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speaker &amp;mdash; Any language barrier between the speaker and listener, lack of training for the speaker, lack of understanding of the audience, or educational difference between the speaker and the audience would be included in this category.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Internal Receiver &amp;mdash; This would involve any language barrier between the listener and the speaker, lack of experience of the listener, educational differences between the speaker and the listener, or any pre-conceived ideas or opinions of the listener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is always best to take the time to plan for any communication. The following simple process will help you overcome these barriers and ensure precise, professional and effective communication in your organization. Remember, the communication process is comprised of four basic elements: sender, message, method and environment, and receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Communication Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Sender: &lt;/strong&gt;The sender must establish credibility by displaying knowledge of the subject, the audience and the context of the delivery. The burden of responsibility lies with the sender to ensure that the message is understood and that expectations for deliverables are clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Message: &lt;/strong&gt;Consider the message being sent. Written, verbal and non-verbal communications are affected by the sender&amp;rsquo;s tone, method of communication and what is included or left out of the message. If you choose to send a written message, be sure that it is professional, precise, clear and written in simple language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Always keep in mind that written communications are open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proof your written communication for typos, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure to reduce the chances of miscommunication and to ensure that you maintain professional credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Method and Environment: &lt;/strong&gt;Messages are conveyed through channels. These channels are affected by the method and environment with which you choose to communicate. Potential channels include verbal communication, face to face, telephone, video conference, written communication, meetings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is wise to consider the method of communication prior to communicating your message. For example, an e-mail, letter or memo may not be the best way to communicate critical information. All written communication is one-way communication, meaning that there is little to no opportunity for people to ask questions, express concern or gain clarification in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the message that you are sending is informational in nature, sending it in written form, such as e-mail, is a very efficient way to communicate quickly with many people based in a wide geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if the message conveys critical information &amp;ndash; such as changes in policies, processes, procedures or organizational changes &amp;ndash; the best method of communication is face to face. You will have to give some thought as to the right environment for the face-to-face communication, e.g., one-on-one individual communication or communicating the information to a group in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Receiver: &lt;/strong&gt;Messages are delivered to your audience, the receivers of the message. Your audience enters into the communication process with ideas and feelings that influence their understanding of your message and dictate their response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, the receivers have pre-conceived ideas or opinions about the topic of your communication. For example, you may be communicating a new initiative, but the audience is already tuning you out because this idea was tried two years ago and did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the sender, you must also consider the barriers that may interfere with the receivers&amp;rsquo; ability to understand the message. These barriers include language, ethnic cultural beliefs, level of education and/or level of experience, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While creating your plan for effective communication, consider not only the communication process outlined above but also the following four strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Meet Individual Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Know your employees as individuals so you can understand the receivers&amp;rsquo; personality traits, gender, generation, education and ethnicity/culture/language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utilize resources relevant to employee needs to select the right method. These resources may include meetings (monthly, weekly, daily), one-on-one meetings with employees (face-to-face, telephone), newsletters, bulletin boards, voicemails, e-mails, pagers and video conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regularly assess the effectiveness of communication methods and evaluate the environmental factors and internal receiver factors, such as possible distractions, time and comfort of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Be Timely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Avoid premature communication, but communicate change as soon as possible. Determine the appropriate method for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Be Inclusive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consider the variables of the workforce. Ensure that communication flows intra-departmentally and inter-departmentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Understand the Impact of Non-Verbal and Written Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Be aware of how non-verbal communication (body language) affects the message. Also, make sure that written communication sends a concise and professional message. Double-check spelling, grammar and punctuation. Choose a readable font and use humor sparingly or avoid it altogether. If you insist on injecting humor into your written communication, be sure that it is appropriate for all audiences and cannot be misconstrued in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow this example format so your written communication is clear, precise and actionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What &lt;/strong&gt;is the key point or message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Why &lt;/strong&gt;is this important/ how is it relevant to goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Action: &lt;/strong&gt;What you need them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;For questions or concerns, provide contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a recent survey of recruiters from companies with more than 50,000 employees, communication skills were cited as the single most important factor in choosing managers. The survey, conducted by the University of Pittsburgh&amp;rsquo;s Katz Business School, points out that communication skills, including written and oral presentations, as well as an ability to work with others, are the main factors contributing to job success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In reality, no matter the size of your business, by successfully getting your message across, you convey your thoughts and ideas effectively. When not successful, the thoughts and ideas that you actually send do not necessarily reflect what you think, causing a communications breakdown and creating roadblocks that stand in the way of your goals &amp;ndash; both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/5Rd5skOogYg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Manage and Benefit from Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Great organizations are always changing. I don&amp;#39;t mean change for the sake of change, but planned, structured, progressive change that enables organizations to grow, evolve, survive and thrive in any type of marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When discussing change, many questions arise, such as: &amp;quot;How can you leverage and manage change?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How can you become a change agent who is constantly and proactively preparing for change?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How can you create a culture where you are able to make change work to your advantage rather than allowing it to destroy you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The better question is, &amp;quot;Why change?&amp;quot; The answer is reflected in the statements below, adapted from Joseph Rost&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Leadership for the Twenty-First Century&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Everything that can be invented has been invented.&amp;quot; (Charles H. Duell, director of the U.S. Patent Office, 1899)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote.&amp;quot; (Grover Cleveland, 1905)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;There is no likelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom.&amp;quot; (Robert Miliham, Nobel Prize in physics, 1923)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;The horse is here today, but the automobile is only a novelty &amp;mdash; a fad.&amp;quot; (President of Michigan Savings Bank advising against investing in the Ford Motor Company)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Video won&amp;#39;t be able to hold on to any market it captures after six months. People will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.&amp;quot; (Daryl F. Zanuck, 20th Century Fox, commenting on television, 1946)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;What use could the company make of an electric toy?&amp;quot; (Western Union, when it turned down rights to the telephone in 1878)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Businesses today are experiencing more change than at any time in history, and the pace of change is accelerating. It has taken just 15 years for 25 percent of households to embrace personal computers, 13 years for cell phones, and astoundingly only seven years for the Internet. (Harris, 2002)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are three types of businesses that implement change. The first is the one that is bottomed out. They suddenly realize that the competition has caught up or maybe even surpassed them and are scrambling to make change in their organization in order to get back on track. Unfortunately for these organizations, by then, it is usually too late. They have been blindsided by change, meaning that they were completely focused on the way they had always done business, allowing new and innovative ideas to catch them off-guard and unprepared to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second type of organization changes just enough to maintain the status quo. These are the companies that are doing OK. Business is pretty good. They say to themselves, &amp;quot;Why do we have to change? Change upsets employees, and change upsets the customers.&amp;quot; Ultimately, they change only enough to maintain their current status. Eventually, they may find themselves in the position of the first organization, where competitors catch up or surpass them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The third type of organization is the one that embraces and leverages change while creating a culture of change, whereby leaders are encouraged or expected to be change agents. They are continually evaluating their organizational structure and looking for ways to make beneficial organizational change. These organizations use change as a catalyst to drive them forward and to improve their business results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jack Welch, retired CEO of General Electric, said, &amp;quot;I am convinced that if the rate of change inside an organization is less than the rate of change outside, the end is in sight.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even powerful organizations do not usually possess an innate skill for making change. It seems to be something that is learned over the long term, and it is a painful process for most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Invariably, when we suggest to organizations that they become more effective at change, the reaction is defensive. Comments like, &amp;quot;You have to be kidding! We&amp;#39;re great at change. We change all the time. We love change!&amp;quot; The truth is, most organizations are not good at change and are especially lacking in the ability to communicate change to employees in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Embracing and leveraging change helps companies to maintain competitive advantage. Knowing and facing this fact is the first step in proactively utilizing change to the advantage of the organization. In order to proactively plan for change, ask yourself and your employees the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the early warning signs in your industry that change is inevitable?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What systems, structures and processes might you put in place to maintain competitive advantage over your competitors and avoid being blindsided?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How can you understand the thinking of demographic groups not represented in your organization?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If you were your own competitor, how could you catch up to or surpass your company?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What customer requests seem the most outrageous and impossible? If you were to consider meeting these requests, what would you have to change to accomplish this task?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What technologies have recently been announced that could threaten your business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to anticipate and leverage change to the advantage of the organization, you must be aware of the external forces driving change. There are three major categories of external forces driving change: information technology, demography and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Information Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The network of computers linked around the world has become a major driver of change in the environment. The world is shrinking, not only creating new and exciting business opportunities, but also creating tough competition. Organizations can now be global, delivering services and information to customers faster and more effectively than ever before. Suppliers are connected through technology, creating efficient systems for ordering, delivery, communication and processes such as just-in-time ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does this mean to your business? In order to maintain competitive advantage, your company must accelerate its ability to learn in order to keep up with accelerating change driven by technology. At the same time, you must manage the decisions that are made around choosing and implementing technology that most benefits your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Demography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demographic differences in the behaviors of customers and employees are the catalyst for organizations learning to meet a broad spectrum of needs and wants for both categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, employees are more educated and as a result expect more involvement and more interesting work. Add to this complication that the workforce today is more diverse, creating unique opportunities and challenges. The rules for motivating employees have changed, and cultural differences must be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, the same demographic challenges that apply to employees also apply to customers. Due to the diverse demographics of customers in the marketplace, it is increasingly difficult to figure out how to meet the broad spectrum of customers&amp;#39; needs and wants. Companies may find themselves trying to be all things to all people, which is an impossible task. Organizations may have to consider changes that will help them to identify and meet their &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; customers&amp;#39; needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customers are more demanding and less tolerant of mistakes than ever before. They want exceptional service. They want employees to be courteous, knowledgeable and proactive in understanding their needs. Customers expect to be involved in decisions that affect them. They want to be asked about processes that impact them and their lives. They want more say and more control. These demands make them a driving force for change in industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An organization must change to meet customers&amp;#39; needs or fail. Without the customer, there is no business. Clients often ask, &amp;quot;How do I know what to change?&amp;quot; The answer is not a simple one. There are many factors to consider, but as far as the customer is concerned, the best way to know what to change is simply to ask them, and ask them frequently. &amp;quot;How are we doing? Are we meeting your needs? If not, what can we do better?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To meet customers&amp;#39; needs and to operate in a fiscally responsible manner, companies must know for sure that they are changing the right things. If they do not, they will find themselves spending a great deal of time and money on ineffective change, or change for the sake of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customer relationship management, commonly referred to as CRM, is one way to effectively manage customer-driven change. CRM involves integrating all customer information and making it available to all employees dealing with customers. CRM eliminates the guesswork and the need for psychic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When pondering change for your organization, the important thing to remember is that change must happen for the right reasons and in the most effective way possible. A plan for change, based on real data and information from customers and employees, must consider the need for new technology and the ever-evolving demographics in the workplace and customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As any organization that is trying to deal with change that is coming fast and furious from external and internal forces knows, it seems like an overwhelming task to compete and grow in an environment where change is a constant. To help manage and benefit from change, from a leader&amp;#39;s perspective, here are three tactics for change management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 1: &lt;/strong&gt;Learn to anticipate the need for change. If an organization waits until circumstances force it to make change, it is too late. Anticipating change means constantly looking at the internal and external forces that are driving change. Once the factors that are driving change have been identified, it is easier to anticipate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Communicate change to all employees up front and candidly. One of the most important steps in a successful change process is communication. Everyone in the organization must receive the communication. Leaders must be held accountable for ensuring that the communication flows in all directions, and especially to the front-line employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employees must understand why the change is happening. In order to achieve buy-in, leaders must candidly and truthfully tell employees the reason(s) for change. One of the most common mistakes that leaders make is that they assume employees do not care or will not understand the factors driving change. These are excuses for avoiding a tough task. Seldom do employees accept the old dictatorial style of &amp;quot;Do it because I&amp;#39;m the boss&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Trust me on this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like it or not, employees want to know, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s in it for me?&amp;quot; This is not about monetary compensation. The benefit for the employee may be a better work environment, more involvement, more opportunities, or it may be as simple as everyone keeps their jobs. Also, statistics show that most employees want communication face to face from his or her leader. They do not want to hear about changes second-hand (i.e., the news media). Failure to communicate even the smallest change candidly and up front erodes trust and creates fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tactic 3: &lt;/strong&gt;Deal with the emotions of change. As leaders prepare to make changes in the organization, they must recognize that change is emotional and plan to deal with the emotions of employees, customers and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plan should incorporate not only the methods to work through the emotions of change but also strategies for communicating the new processes and policies for getting work done. Leaders must ask themselves, &amp;quot;How might employees, customers and vendors react when they hear the change news?&amp;quot; Natural emotional reactions to change are anger, fear and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders who respond with impatience or anger to the emotions of change are validating the employee&amp;#39;s belief that the change is bad. The result may be an unhappy and less productive workforce, high turnover of skilled and knowledgeable employees, and possibly even formal complaints to employee relations or unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does all of this mean to you as a leader? It means that your job is to anticipate change and to figure out what it looks like from the business perspective. You must identify the internal and external forces driving change in your organization and, considering these forces, identify how to implement change effectively, leveraging change for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is also means that it is your job to help employees accept change and to assist you in implementing change that will drive the organization forward. Ensure that part of your change plan includes a comprehensive communication process and that it addresses the emotional aspects of change. It is not always comfortable, but it is reality and something from which great leaders do not hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/KFhGqTNU70s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Increase Training to Improve Results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	While it&amp;#39;s true that training is an investment in time and money, a study by the American Management Association found that companies that increased their training after changes in the organization reported 63-percent higher productivity, 69-percent higher profits and 74-percent higher quality. In contrast, companies that did not increase training after changes in the organization observed significantly lower results, including a 34-percent productivity increase, 40-percent profit increase and a 24-percent quality increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These statistics are relevant not only to employees who have undergone change in an organization but also for employees who are new to an organization. Studies show that in all circumstances training increases profits by enhancing employee satisfaction, reducing stress and decreasing turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your business results are critical to your success. Why would you place people who have a direct impact on the bottom line in a position where they do not have the skills, knowledge, resources and tools to be successful? Yet that is exactly the circumstance in many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contrary to what you may have heard, most people want to succeed. It is the responsibility of supervisors and managers to utilize available resources to train, qualify and develop their employees in order to position them for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training comes in many forms, but first let&amp;rsquo;s consider what training is not. It is not a job shadow experience, sometimes called the &amp;quot;Follow Joe&amp;quot; method of training. Assigning a new employee to walk around with another employee and watch what they do is not effective. Furthermore, if the person whom the new hire is following is not one of your best employees, the new hire will invariably learn to do things wrong. The end result is additional costs to retrain and break bad habits learned during their &amp;quot;training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the &amp;quot;Follow Joe&amp;quot; method of training does not provide a structure whereby all employees are taught to perform like tasks in a consistent way. It often leaves employees on their own to figure out how the details of the work are to be done. The very best people will come up with something that works for them. The others will get discouraged very quickly and either quit or may have to be discharged, leaving you scratching your head and wondering how this great person you hired turned out to be so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An on-the-job training (OJT) program is one of the most efficient training methods because it is a structured process that is planned, organized and delivered at the employee&amp;rsquo;s work site. While an OJT process is effective for any business, it is especially cost-effective for industrial jobs, those where employees perform repeatable tasks. An OJT plan should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. A Process for the Selection of Trainers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Post the trainer opening, giving all employees a chance to submit interest and clearly state the minimum requirements, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No negative job performance notations on his or her record for a stated period of time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A performance review rating that is above average&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No more than two attendance infractions within the last six months&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A minimum of one year of experience in the job skills for the posted trainer opening&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proven people skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. The Total Number of Hours of Planned Training for the Job Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This may vary with different lines of business and is usually based on the complexity of the job&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The hours should be flexible whenever possible and within reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. The Method by which Training will be Delivered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Online&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Face to face in small groups&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Face to face with one trainee at a time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hands-on&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A combination of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	4. The Method by which Training will be Evaluated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide a check-out test at key milestones within the training program to assess whether the new employee is ready to move to the next step&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide a check-out test at the end of the program to assess whether the employee is ready to go solo&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be prepared to give additional training if the employee&amp;rsquo;s check-out test score is below average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	5. A Process for Accountability throughout the Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide a training outline for each task description that is trained&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		As each task is trained and the employee agrees that he or she is comfortable, have the employee and the trainer sign their initials beside the task description&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		File the outline in the employee&amp;#39;s file for future reference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When designing your OJT program, it is critical that you have comprehensive trainer selection criteria in place. Even the best OJT programs are doomed to fail if the trainers do not have training skills, such as patience and other human relations skills, along with strong communication skills. Generally, when we are asked as consultants to evaluate an OJT program with a high failure rate where new employees repeatedly perform poorly after training, the failure is linked directly to the designated trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While most trainers want to do a good job, many do not innately know how to train others. Therefore, you must provide the selected trainer with training, teaching them a specific process for training others effectively. Remember, a person who is great at his or her task will not necessarily make a great trainer, which is why it is critical to have strong selection criteria in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it is important to have a planned number of hours for training that is appropriate for the complexity of the job, it is equally important to build in flexibility within the planned training hours. For example, some people will catch on quickly. Other new employees may need a little extra time for specific functions. The supervisor of the department should be open to guidance and suggestions from the trainer regarding the new employee&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The method of training should also be considered. People learn differently. Some are visual, while others are tactile, for example. Thus, a combination of training tools that incorporates as many of the senses as possible will be the most effective technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The one-on-one trainer-to-trainee process has been found to be the most successful method. Of course, this is not always possible. If you are unable to schedule new employees individually with a trainer, it is strongly recommended to keep the groups small. The best-case scenario is three to four people for one trainer. At the very least, schedule the trainees on the same schedule (including days off) as their trainer to promote consistency in the information received and to allow for a relationship to build between the trainer and the trainee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensure that accountability measures are in place by providing a detailed method for evaluating the new employee&amp;rsquo;s progress during his or her training. When I worked in human resources for the resorts at Walt Disney World, I was part of a team that designed OJT programs for all lines of business within the hospitality job functions. We created accountability OJT outlines and check-out tests that assessed the employees&amp;rsquo; ability to perform on their own and also provided an accountability measure that was used to assess the employee&amp;rsquo;s readiness and/or right fit for the job in which he or she was placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A side benefit to this procedure is that it is a way to assess and hold accountable the skills and performance of your trainers. If a trainer has a high percentage of trainees who fail the check-out tests, it may be that the trainer is not a right fit for training or needs additional training for his or her skill development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An effective on-the-job training program accomplishes many goals. Most obviously, it offers a way to ensure that each new employee is given the skills, knowledge and abilities to be successful in his or her role. It ensures that the quality of training is consistent across the organization and plays a significant role in reducing turnover once you have done due diligence in recruiting and hiring right-fit people for your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/urf-yoWWo9k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Workforce Retention: How to Keep your Best Employees</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The first two steps in becoming a talent-management organization involve attracting and hiring right-fit/best-fit talent. After this has been achieved, the next question becomes, &amp;quot;How do you keep them?&amp;quot; After all, if you are going to spend the time and money to put a process in place for recruiting and hiring the best of the best, it is self-defeating to drop the ball after the employee comes on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jac Fitz-enz, author of the book &amp;quot;The ROI of Human Capital: Measuring the Economic Value of Employee Performance,&amp;quot; had this to say about corporate culture: &amp;quot;The more I study organizational profitability, the more I am convinced of the power of culture.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fitz-enz cites a study published in &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine that reported on the 100 most admired companies in the world. The study found that corporate culture was a key factor in differentiating top-performing companies from average companies. Bruce Pfau of the Hay Group, who led the study, said, &amp;quot;The single-best predictor of overall excellence was a company&amp;rsquo;s ability to attract, motivate and retain talent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CEOs, in referring to this study, said that corporate culture was their most important lever in enhancing this key capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Bain and Company in an article published in &lt;em&gt;Harvard Management Update&lt;/em&gt;, 91 percent of the 1,200 senior executives at global companies surveyed agreed that &amp;ldquo;culture is as important as strategy for business success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The foundation for employee retention is a strong orientation program that conveys the culture of the organization and ensures that new employees understand their role in delivering on that culture. It clearly communicates expectations of employees&amp;rsquo; behaviors and actions while on the job, and provides the tools that enable the employees to deliver on those behaviors and expectations. Most companies have an orientation of some kind, but I am not referring to eight hours in a room reading from the policies and procedures manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/10/24/b5d79b63-4b1d-4b03-ac41-b810c8f83d22_workforce_retention-300x200.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;So, what are the elements of an effective orientation program, taking into consideration the specific needs of the organization, its corporate culture, and the employee and customer demographics of the region? Very broadly, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. &lt;strong&gt;Introduction: &lt;/strong&gt;A warm welcome sets the tone. Every person should be greeted and welcomed personally by the facilitator of the program. Whenever possible, a personal welcome by a company executive makes a lasting, positive impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, one organization we have recently assisted with the redesign of their orientation program now has the CEO make an appearance at the beginning of each program. She takes about two minutes to introduce herself and tell the group how excited she is to have them on board. The goal is for her to make her welcome as a personal appearance, but for those times when she is not available, they have created a video that is shown at the very beginning of the orientation program. The response from the groups so far has been very exciting. In evaluations at the end of the program, the No. 1 comment is that having the CEO welcome them makes them feel special and valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. &lt;strong&gt;History:&lt;/strong&gt; Give the new employees a sense of where the company has been. Only by understanding where the company has been and how it began can the new employee comprehend how it arrived at its current position in the marketplace. The history should include stories about the mistakes, struggles and successes of the company that give the employees a sense of the real people and founders who are the core of the current culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. &lt;strong&gt;Present:&lt;/strong&gt; Talk candidly about where the company is today, including who you are, how you operate, and how customers interact and do business with you. This is also a good time to talk about current milestones and successes, as well as the processes, policies, procedures and philosophies that have made the company successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. &lt;strong&gt;Future: &lt;/strong&gt;Clearly and passionately articulate the vision for the future and the employees&amp;rsquo; role in making that vision a reality. If possible, give information regarding exciting projects on the drawing board and the benefit of joining the company at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5. &lt;strong&gt;Tools/Resources&lt;/strong&gt;: This should include but is not limited to&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Policy and procedural manuals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Contact lists&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Employee handbook&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Insurance information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Other collateral deemed necessary&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Service theme&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Service standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The service theme represents the purpose or promise statement. It supports the brand promise, identifies a common goal and supersedes all tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because service is an integral part of the long-term success of an organization, a supporting structure must be in place. We call these service standards or values. They define service, ensure consistency in the delivery of service, and enable employees to make decisions and judgments as well as prioritize actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Service standards give employees the tools needed to deliver on the service theme. They are prioritized and ranked by order of importance, and defined clearly for the new employees, who must be told how to use them to make good decisions in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, companies utilize three to five service standards. For instance, a bank determined that its service standards were security, accuracy, professional courtesy and responsiveness. Security was first because the bank learned through surveys that its customers considered courtesy and responsiveness secondary to the security of their money and the accuracy of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Teaching the service theme and service standards to new employees in orientation is one way of ensuring that everyone understands what is expected of them and has the tools to consistently deliver on the common goal(s) of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6. &lt;strong&gt;Fun:&lt;/strong&gt; A great orientation program builds in fun through activities and interaction. For example, when I was a traditions (orientation) instructor at Walt Disney World, we interacted with the new cast members (employees) with a quick and simple activity. Each table was asked to name as many Disney characters as possible in one minute. This may seem frivolous and a little silly, but the activity actually has meaningful purpose, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It fosters teamwork, which is a big part of Disney&amp;#39;s culture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The animated characters from Disney&amp;rsquo;s world-famous films are not only part of the company&amp;rsquo;s culture, but guests often ask cast members questions about the characters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		It engages the participants and increases the energy level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of our clients incorporates an activity they call &amp;ldquo;Show What You Know&amp;rdquo; at the end of each major segment of the program. They are presenting it like a game show, and the participants get small rewards for answering questions related to the module they just heard. Again, this small activity has a multi-purpose goal: It keeps the energy level high, and it ensures that the participants are retaining information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the questions we are frequently asked is, &amp;quot;How many hours per day should we devote to orientation?&amp;quot; Most of our clients find that an effective orientation is comprised of a seven- to eight-hour day to address the topics we have discussed above, plus a second day of three to four hours to convey policies, procedures, review insurance, etc. However, each organization is different with varying needs. Only you can determine what will work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to remember that your orientation program lays the foundation for your expectations of new employees and provides them with the tools and resources to deliver service that is in alignment with your culture and values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/sqjUAuUBO0U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>2 Keys for Organizational Effectiveness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Great leaders are able to critically assess an organization&amp;#39;s structure and culture, and are willing to make changes where needed in order to position the company for success. However, organizational effectiveness is about more than structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two secrets within the element of organizational effectiveness that are critical to the success of any company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintaining a lean and efficient internal organizational structure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensuring that your organization has policies and processes in place to hold leaders accountable for their behaviors as well as results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Maintaining a lean and efficient organization&amp;quot; means that leaders must regularly assess the current structure of the company to determine its ability to contribute to the success of the organization. A heavily layered organization is oppressive, inhibits communication, hinders the sharing of ideas and interferes with the ability to take care of customers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eventually, employees and customers will get discouraged and give up. The end result can be high employee turnover and customer defection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ensuring that your organization is not top heavy and that it is as lean as possible facilitates strong relationships with employees and communication in all directions at all levels. It also makes it easier for customers to express their ideas, wants and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Look around your organization and ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is employee turnover high?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are employees doing only enough to get by or stay out of trouble?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are your employees apathetic?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are customers defecting at a rate higher than the average for your industry?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do you get more complaints than compliments on service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you answered &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to any of these questions, this may be a warning sign or symptom of an organizational structure that makes it difficult or even impossible for employees to share their ideas or communicate daily operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are two tactics for assessing the leanness of your organizational structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate the job description of each manager in your organization. Is there duplication of responsibilities that may cause confusion and interference with effective processes or delay growth and forward progress?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conduct a business process review to identify overlap and inefficiencies within policies, processes and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second element of organizational structure is leadership accountability &amp;mdash; ensuring you have clearly articulated expectations and have processes in place for holding leaders accountable not only for business performance but also for behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations today realize that &amp;ldquo;Type A&amp;rdquo; managers &amp;mdash; leaders who are controlling, autocratic and manage by intimidation &amp;mdash; are ineffective and damaging to the organization. In most companies, these types of managers are no longer tolerated. Within your organizational structure, you must not only consider the physical structure but also the types of managers or leaders that have power and authority over employees and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if you have a leader who is delivering on business performance but behaves inappropriately, that person has to change or go. These are tough decisions to make. However, you cannot afford to tolerate such people or their behaviors for very long. They may be contributing successfully to the bottom line for the time being, but ultimately these leaders will create chaos and failure within your organizational structure, eroding profits through employee turnover and customer defection. In addition, the employees who will leave are the productive ones that you cannot afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Generally, leaders fall into one of four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The person who is neither delivering on business results nor exhibiting appropriate behavior. There is no question that these leaders must be asked to leave the company.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The leader who delivers great business results but does not model the right behavior. This leader is contributing to the bottom line but is not treating employees well. Often called &amp;ldquo;results-oriented leaders,&amp;rdquo; they are leaving dead bodies in their wake. Yet it is traditional in business that these people are rewarded and promoted for bringing bottom-line results to the organization without thought for the long-term consequences of their actions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The third type of leader has strong relationship skills but does not demonstrate business savvy. These leaders are liked and respected by their employees. Employees readily follow them blindly and happily down whichever path the leader chooses. The good news is that with some training these leaders usually can learn the business skills necessary to be successful. In other words, the leaders with strong relationship skills are most likely to develop into ideal leaders if they can learn competent business skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The fourth leadership type is the ideal leader. These are the people who are getting business results for your organization, demonstrating the organization&amp;rsquo;s values and behaviors, and building great relationships with the employees and customers. They have learned to balance the leadership characteristics of building relationships with holding people accountable. They take disciplinary action when necessary, reward and recognize when it is appropriate, bring money to the bottom line, and give great service to customers. If this type of leader sounds like a miracle worker, it is for good reason. Mastering this scope of relationship and business skills is very difficult. It is no surprise that these people are a small percentage of leaders in any organization. When you find them, you must do everything in your power to keep them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within your organizational structure, you must have processes and tools in place to help you identify which types of leaders are running your organization. Once you have identified where your leaders fit, it is up to you to have processes in place that will clearly state expectations for business results and behavior. You must then provide the tools, training, knowledge and skills that will allow each leader to realize his or her full potential. Once you have done these things, you must hold these people accountable for their performance and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If they cannot deliver on both goals, then you may have to make a decision about allowing them to remain in a leadership position or possibly move them to a different role in the organization. It may even be necessary to ask them to leave the organization. Although this may cause short-term strain, it will allow you to promote from within or hire from outside the organization an ideal leader who will contribute to the long-term success of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/jDiYwfZ8I08" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Leaders Must Have Vision</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Great leaders have vision. There are very few natural visionary leaders in the corporate world. I have been lucky to have worked with two during my 34-year career with Walt Disney World. The good news is that this is a skill that can be learned. It is probably the most powerful tool in a leader&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. So what is a vision? How does it work, and how is it different from a vision statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;#39;s begin by defining a vision statement and a vision. A vision statement is a statement of words describing where and what an organization wants to be in the future. It usually remains unchanged for many years. There is nothing wrong with vision statements. They have their place in the organizational structure. However, vision statements do not necessarily translate into action. Without action, an organization has a nicely framed statement on the wall but no forward motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In contrast, vision can be defined as a picture in the leader&amp;#39;s imagination that motivates people to action when communicated compellingly, passionately and clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be a visionary, a leader need have nothing more than a clear vision of the future. The difficult task is communicating that vision with clarity and passion in order to motivate and inspire people to take action. A visionary leader who clearly and passionately communicates his or her vision can motivate employees to act with passion and purpose, thereby ensuring that everyone is working toward a common goal. The end result is that everyone contributes to the organization&amp;#39;s forward momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In order to take the organization to the highest possible level, leaders must engage their people with a compelling and tangible vision,&amp;quot; said Warren Bennis, professor of business administration at the University of Southern California&amp;#39;s Marshall School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What follows is a practice exercise that you can use to develop and hone your visionary communication skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: &lt;/strong&gt;Think of one challenge within your department, division or organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Imagine the big picture. Visualize the incredible future success that you will realize from the new and improved situation, as well as the benefits to the organization and to the employees. This is your chance to be a true visionary. No dream is too big or too fantastic. This is the &amp;quot;pie in the sky&amp;quot; result you are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: &lt;/strong&gt;Determine how you will communicate your vision. What words and phrases will you use? In what environment will you choose to communicate your vision &amp;ndash; in a staff meeting, one on one, with supervisors and managers? How will you communicate the benefits to the staff and to the organization? Write down your ideas on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: &lt;/strong&gt;Practice communicating what you have written. Make sure it sounds sincere. Practice out loud to yourself and to others. If you don&amp;#39;t believe it, no one else will believe it either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you use this exercise frequently, you will find that expressing your vision in a compelling and clear manner will soon feel very natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you are ready to communicate your vision to your employees, give them only the vision of success. Great leaders use vision as a tool to inspire and motivate, not to dictate. Do not give your employees the steps for achieving the vision, but let them determine the methods and tactics for achieving the goal. Great leaders know how to give the gift of vision and then step away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/6wj4IjcjfjI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Assess Your Value, Unique Contribution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/9/26/cb4fd9ba-fd17-4375-97ac-c3660b552940_Value Point.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;As an instructor for the U.S. Postal Service, I often taught classes where 40 executives would spend two weeks at our executive center learning about all functions of the company and gaining a familiarity with the business of business. More than once, an executive would ask me what the cost of this experience was to the company. Now, the direct costs were easily calculated, so I would follow up with &amp;quot;What costs besides travel costs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These people were asking about the loss of effectiveness to their organization due to their absence. They were serious, and I was aghast at their presumption. In truth, their operations probably breathed a sigh of relief, and effectiveness likely increased. That was when I was much younger and still had some innocence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since then, I have had opportunities to address groups of all sizes on employee motivation, leadership development, actionable metrics, process improvement, etc. I am most interested in helping people learn about themselves as the first step toward helping others to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I employ a simple exercise during a presentation, couched as a stretch-the-legs exercise. I ask all attendees to stand up. Then, I begin a little audience participation. I ask that those who believe things at home will not go as well while they are at this meeting to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I then ask those who believe that a full week&amp;rsquo;s absence will have no effect or loss to output to sit down. Then two weeks, then four weeks &amp;hellip; OK, how about six weeks? With about 15 percent of the audience standing, I then ask all to sit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Each of you has defined what you perceive to be your value point for your organization. This is where you decided that your unique contribution to the company comes into play.&amp;quot; Each of the attendees has a unique situation by which they may rationalize their value point, and indeed it could be situational. The message here is that some managers were standing at six weeks. What could each person individually do to revise his or her value point? How do people define their unique contribution(s)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In studying management, Peter Drucker brought up the concept of a person&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;unique contribution&amp;quot; to his or her company. This is what identifies that person&amp;rsquo;s value. It could be unique experience, knowledge, passion, talent, relationships, skills, abilities, interpersonal abilities, political savvy, etc. Is it truly unique? Will it pigeon-hole the person or affect his or her career? What effect does it have on the person&amp;#39;s subordinates, peers or superiors? How does he or she exploit it (for power, to destroy or to help)? What happens if this person was hit by a truck and lost to the organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In &amp;quot;Leadership is an Art,&amp;quot; author Max De Pree tells about the retirement of a college custodian. Several hundred people showed up, and selected former students spoke. All present testified to the effect this custodian had on their lives. He was a true listener with an understanding heart who always had time for students. His gift was an ability to guide students to make their own decisions and develop their confidence as directors of their own lives. The speakers included a general, CEOs and &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What was his unique contribution and how did he use it? What was his value point? Do you use your unique contribution as the custodian did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, humility trumps pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/CXn2honjRpc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Learning Conflict Resolution for $1</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In my seminars and speeches, I sometimes use audience participation to drive home a point or to interrupt the &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve heard it all before&amp;quot; mind-set. It is important to put what follows in the context of problem-solving or conflict resolution. An example would be with a contentious team or when discussing the issue of Band-Aiding a problem or fixing it right the first time. You have my blessing to use this exercise if you promise not to let the cat out of the bag if you are ever in my audience or class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Begin by saying, &amp;quot;I am going to auction off a dollar bill. Here it is: a real greenback. There is a slight catch; the second highest bidder also has to pay me. Does everyone understand the rules? Who will start with a nickel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(If someone starts with a dollar, explain that some folks would like to make some money, and you would like an opening bid of a nickel or a dime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have your nickel bid, you can proceed with: &amp;quot;Great, you have a bargain. Is there anyone who can bid a dime?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this point, I&amp;#39;ll usually get a dime, and someone else will chip in with a quarter. If not, get into the audience and encourage people to bid higher. The more bidders, the merrier, although my experience is that it quickly becomes two bidders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I now go back to the dime person and say, &amp;quot;You are now out a dime. Be the higher bidder and you are ahead.&amp;quot; Or, I will say, &amp;quot;Are all of you going to let this guy have 75 cents when you could get into the process?&amp;quot; Someone will enter the fray. You have to keep going to the lower bidder to goad them into bidding higher. Use words like pride, loser, power, winner, make easy money, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When two people are over 50 cents each, someone will make the astute observation that you are now ahead and making money. Ignore it. Keep after the bidders by asking the lower bidder, &amp;quot;Are you going to let the other bidder get away with you holding the bag?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At some point, each will realize what they are doing. Most times, the bids will go over a dollar if you work them. When one finally quits, it is lesson time. (Do not collect, but give the dollar to the highest bidder.) Ask them and the audience to explain what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They are trying to reduce their losses by raising the ante, which is getting more costly for both at the same time. Is pride an element? Was your constant harassment a factor? Is winning at any cost a mind-set?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Can you relate this experience to real life? We see it every day &amp;mdash; from not being upfront with other people and telling half-truths to making assumptions, getting our backs up against the wall, winning at any cost, not disclosing information, distrusting, looking good at someone else&amp;#39;s expense, compromising and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seek out examples in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To close, tell them, &amp;quot;Sometimes Joe will lean over to Helen and say, &amp;#39;You bid a nickel, I&amp;#39;ll bid a quarter and we&amp;#39;ll stop bidding.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; This is a win-win situation and leads you to discussing another lesson. What the two bidders have done this time is demonstrate that it is possible to buy a dollar for less than a dollar, and all the emotional and personal baggage can be eliminated if there is direct communication between the parties with a desire to get it behind them and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases of conflict, it is important to revisit the facts and causes without the blame finger to gain understanding before deciding to expend ever more energy and resources trying to resolve a problem that is getting ever larger. This is why there are mediators, arbitrators, psychologists and effective leaders. Otherwise, damage control overcomes moving ahead and may be the demise of a person&amp;#39;s career or even the existence of a corporation. An opening bid of $1 would replicate one of two parties possibly realizing they are the problem and deciding to seek a correct solution from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have sold the dollar for as much as $3.50. The professor who introduced this to me used a $10 bill in a bar and quickly left after earning $15. Good luck. Remember, people should realize this is more than a game and should be able to see themselves and their organization in the example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/AbbbHuq9M7A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Foster Teamwork for Better Results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A major mail-processing plant in Philadelphia with approximately 2,000 employees on five floors was experiencing unscheduled absences greater than 7 percent along with poor quality and high expenses. Its reputation was questionable. If you walked the plant floors, you would have trouble seeing farther than 50 feet. You would also notice deplorable restrooms (not a custodial issue), an absence of supervision, paint peeling from the walls and lots of red-tagged rolling stock on the floor. In spite of this, the maintenance department was held in high esteem as it managed to keep the equipment operating. You can imagine the magnitude of union grievances, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO) complaints and letters to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plant manager, Al LaRiviere, had a challenge. His first actions were to remove all red-tagged equipment as well as the equipment that was not being used. The number of items that were placed in the parking lot numbered more than 1,000. More than half were scrapped, while the others were eventually repaired at another facility. Next, he began a process-management study of what really transpired in the plant and worked to get management involved as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was a 24-hour, 365-day plant with three shifts per day. There were approximately 350 employees in the maintenance staff to manage the building&amp;rsquo;s more than 1 million square feet, customer lobbies, 20 acres of land, more than 200 pieces of automation, 2 miles of conveyor, all custodial needs and the 25 stations around the city. The original plant was a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project and had been modified numerous times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Originating mail (mailed within the plant&amp;rsquo;s service area) and destinating mail (coming into the plant&amp;rsquo;s processing area) processes were broken into streams (letters, parcels, small items and bundles). It had an inventory turn of 365 per year (unable to store mail). Critical metrics were measured in days from the mail being placed in a box to the delivery day (delivery standards). Each type of mail had different standards. There was also a quasi-metric of work hours used versus work hours earned (budget performance). These were the results metrics on which the plant manager was rated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An external evaluation of the management team&amp;rsquo;s competencies recommended team training, individual training, and development of all supervisors and managers on interpersonal skills and how to supervise. This was begun concurrent with the process-management study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the study, the performance indicators were identified as process or results. Examples of process were absence, production, unit quality and meeting work-area clearance times. The bottom line was did the mail clear the various operations having had quality sortation and did the right mail get on the correct transportation at the scheduled dispatch time. These last two questions became the plant results indicators. If they were consistently met, the plant&amp;rsquo;s delivery standards were met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with the process study results, LaRiviere made a decision that he only wanted his management teams to be concerned with two metrics &amp;mdash; clearing the mail on time and quality of sortation. He felt that productivity was the result of the individuals&amp;rsquo; motivation and would accompany the meeting of the indicators. These became the results indicators for each supervisor&amp;rsquo;s/superintendent&amp;rsquo;s processing areas. The shift managers had the results indicators of the right mail on the right trucks at the right time. All staff meetings or other management discussions were limited to those two sets of metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere even had a small stand with three steps built for the conference room. If a person failed his metrics, he had to climb the steps to stand up and be counted. There was no follow-up discussion. However, LaRiviere did institute celebrations for achievements (lots of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training for all employees focused on the two metrics and the process within their work areas. Supervisors were not to focus on absence rates, individual performance, reasons for incoming mail quality or being critical about any other process with their employees. It was the supervisor&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to worry about upstream and downstream problems and to have his or her employees focus on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supervisors were also to develop a team. Each supervisor posted his or her team&amp;rsquo;s process indicators each day (how much was processed, work hours, internal quality and delayed mail). All machine operators were trained on using the machine-generated production reports, and rudiments of overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) were built into the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make this work, plant employees were assigned to specific supervisors. All supervisors adhered to the game plan and were kept informed of overall U.S. Postal Service performance, their plant performance and their own area&amp;rsquo;s effect on performance. They were becoming respected go-to people for the craft employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere believed that if employees knew that their managers were all on the same ship, where it was going and the game plan for getting there, they would find the confidence and motivation to perform and go home at night with a sense of accomplishment and pride in their plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance employees were trained on interpreting equipment performance reports, understanding the customer-supplier relationship with operators and relating to the operations people in a problem-solving mode to stop the blame game. Conversations between employees and their supervisor centered on processes in their work areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have only touched the surface of this remarkable turnaround. Unscheduled absences dropped to 3 percent, productivity increased 20 percent and the plant&amp;rsquo;s quality led the region. Would you believe they now had too many people coming to work each day? Employees now counted on supervisors to supervise, keep them informed and buffer them. Supervisors now held their heads up and looked forward to coming to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LaRiviere also had the interior plant painted and put up meaningful signage to make it a visual workplace. He reduced the number and size of restrooms (original employment was more than 4,000 employees). He then worked the same process with human resources, finance, maintenance, vehicle operations and office staffs. LaRiviere was a unique manager who was at the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this is not necessarily a maintenance story, it does illustrate the use of process-management tools, the understanding of what makes people tick and what a vision can produce when the top dog is given the freedom to take a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/ltgEU87Bo-0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Hire Right-fit Employees </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to Entrepreneur.com, &amp;quot;One of the biggest challenges for companies is hiring the right candidates for their jobs and their culture. The reason is that most managers have not been trained in the art and science of hiring human beings.&amp;quot; They cite the most common reasons for hiring wrong-fit employees as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hiring decisions are based on personal preference.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Managers may hire people because they like the way they look, smile, dress, act or speak.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A very common trend is for managers to hire someone that they perceive to be like them or like someone they know and like.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The candidate may be good at one or two aspects of the job, and the hiring manager eagerly assumes or hopes that the candidate will be good at the other aspects or can learn the other aspects.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The interviewer takes the candidate&amp;rsquo;s word that he or she has the experience and skills to do the job, or the resume is used as a tool to determine the candidate&amp;rsquo;s worthiness and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There is a tendency to hire a moderately qualified person because the manager needs someone now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some key methods for avoiding biases and making successful hiring decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Identify Key Factors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also referred to as knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs), these are the key factors that the ideal candidate must possess to successfully perform the job. Once you have identified the KSAs, ensure that they are incorporated into the job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With regards to job descriptions, you first must have them. When consulting for companies who have asked us to help them with their hiring process, we often find that they do not have job descriptions or have generic descriptions used for several lines of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, it is critical that a job description not only clearly state the KSAs necessary to qualify for a position but also the expected behaviors&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Remember, it is not just about the candidate&amp;rsquo;s ability to perform the task; it is also about his or her ability to fit into the culture of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Ask Key Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ask specific and measurable questions that will be asked of all candidates and that will clearly and behaviorally demonstrate that they have the KSAs to perform the job. While the candidate is responding to this type of question, the interviewer can observe how well the candidate analyzes situations, how rationally or logically the situation is presented, and how well he or she will fit into the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To design and utilize an interviewing process that is specific and measurable, try the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ask relevant general questions that will assist you in determining if the candidate is a right fit for your culture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the behavior(s) and/or skills that are necessary for the potential employee to demonstrate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ask behavioral-based and situational-based questions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the ideal answer for each question.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use a rating system that enables the manager to make an objective decision regarding right-fit candidates, measuring the candidate&amp;rsquo;s answer against the ideal answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Possible general questions might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is your understanding of the responsibilities of this position?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Why do you want to work here?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What does &amp;ldquo;teamwork&amp;rdquo; mean to you?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What skills and experience do you bring to the job that other candidates might not offer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examples of possible behavior-based questions or open-ended questions designed to assess behavioral traits and tendencies of the candidate would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Give me an example of when you lost your patience with a customer, vendor or co-worker. What happened?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell me about a time when you followed organizational policy and procedures, even when you thought your own idea was better.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell me about a time when you made a serious error on the job. What were the circumstances and what did you do?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What have you done to support your co-workers on your last job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Possible situation-based questions or scenario questions stating a specific situation designed to assess the candidate&amp;rsquo;s likely response in a similar situation could include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Your scheduled shift is over in 10 minutes when the manager approaches you to stay two extra hours to help the plant recover lost production. What do you say to the manager?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A vendor approaches you looking for the manager. Assisting the vendor may mean falling behind in production. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A customer calls to complain about a shortage on his order. According to your records, the order was delivered on time and in full. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You may find it helpful to create an interviewing grid that contains the information you need to interview each candidate using the specific and measurable process described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two sample grids are provided below. For each question, identify your ideal response and rate each candidate based on how close they come to the ideal response, with 1 being the lowest score and 5 being the highest score. This process allows for consistency in interviewing each candidate and also helps to reduce manipulation by savvy candidates. Be sure to allow enough time between interviews to write additional notes about the candidate and to assign a rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Behavior-based Grid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, you have identified the behavior of integrity. The behavior-based question is intended to allow the potential candidate to express integrity without asking outright, &amp;quot;How do you demonstrate integrity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/8/30/422371fa-73ad-4c97-a799-d7d3f4adc2cb_How to Hire Right-fit Employees-image 1.jpeg" style="width: 600px; height: 206px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Situation-based Grid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this question, you are assessing the candidate&amp;rsquo;s ability to act as a team player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Help Employees Get the Most from Their Career and Life</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/8/29/d81e1748-57f7-44e3-befd-64de1e83ac32_help-employees-get-most.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left;" /&gt;While giving an update on the successes of a maintenance leadership mentoring program that was celebrating its ninth anniversary, I was told that the program caused four employees to leave the company. This challenge involved two important issues that should be shared at this time of industry turmoil and the possible need for employees to find new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first issue relates to the company&amp;rsquo;s sponsored program. It was designed to fast-track bright potential candidates to be in positions to replace retiring maintenance managers. Over the first eight years, the two-year program with about 80 graduates recorded more than 120 prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; promotions. Not only were the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;s promoted, but the mentors were promoted. Both groups had grown personally, professionally and organizationally. However, the company&amp;rsquo;s value received was minor compared to the participants&amp;rsquo; value received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; confided that he was not really interested in a promotion and was concerned that he would be asked to leave. I addressed this by saying: &amp;ldquo;This program is designed to help the individual achieve his or her potential in life. That life includes family, community, work, education/learning and spiritual growth. We cannot focus on the promotion. You must develop yourself to be able to handle the ramifications of a new position and balance all the other factors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All I asked of the participants was to take their experiences, new skills and knowledge back to their family, community and workplace with the hope of helping others to grow. That attitude and behavior would be what would get them promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I met this prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; and his wife three years later, and what he said confirmed my intentions. He had become the go-to supervisor, the unofficial mentor of new and old employees; worked at various positions outside of maintenance; had changed his health habits; was more in love than ever (35 years married); and loved life. He was one of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This was the same program that caused four employees to leave the company. However, in helping people find themselves, we use a technique championed by Richard Bolles in his book, &amp;ldquo;What Color is Your Parachute?&amp;rdquo; Bolles&amp;rsquo; approach is based upon finding your God-given gifts (your parachute) and understanding that you will be most satisfied in life if you are using and expanding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through an exhaustive exercise of defining your skills, values, desires, expectations and possible jobs that fit your profile, you are able to evaluate and identify the gifts that you truly have. Gifts are skills and include writing, teaching, coaching, helping, accounting, working with your hands, planning and any of the remaining hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, you will discover where and when you use these most effectively: alone, in small groups, in large companies, inter-group, in startups, in structured environments, in nebulous situations, etc. Then, what types of people do you work best with? What company values do you seek? What location do you prefer geographically? Where is your family in all of this? (They are foremost.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you have worked through the exercises to discover these things about yourself, put down on paper the ideal job defined by the above factors. Then, describe how a typical day would go from the time you awoke, walking through the office door, the work day (interactions, using gifts, how you measured accomplishment, etc.), coming home and the evening activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So there you have it, a parachute with many colors. You are laying out a vision for your life. Have you thought about doing that? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time to do so? Can you help your employees do the same? Maybe give each a copy of the book and workbook and have periodic sessions on finding yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We had four who did so and discovered they were in the wrong company and line of work. I was personally humbled to have had that much effect on them and their families. Each has done very well since. It was a lesson for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, humility overrules pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/ja_7L4IU9MM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

One of the things I decided to change was to push myself deeper into the details of the multitude of ongoing projects. I realized there was so much going on that I was having trouble providing enough attention to the details involved in each project. I was only brought in and sought after if there was a problem or a tough decision needed to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As this little epiphany came into light, I realized that this was not good for me or my team members. So, I set about making it one of my priorities to work on from that point forward (in the name of my own continuous improvement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, it also occurred to me at the same time that a change of my level of attention could cause the organization to take a step back and feel a little nervous about what I was doing and why I was doing it. As I pondered this notion, I decided to seek out some advice. I reached out to one of my mentors and explained to him the dilemma that I was facing and asked for his counsel in how I should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	His first question was, &amp;ldquo;How do you think your people will feel about this change?&amp;rdquo; As I explained that I thought they might feel a little unnerved or concerned about why I was changing this approach, he nodded in understanding. He asked me a few more questions, and we briefly discussed the problem. Then he said, &amp;ldquo;Beau, how would you feel if your boss changed his behavior like this?&amp;rdquo; I explained that I think I would feel much like my people are going to feel about it. He agreed, and then asked me what would make me feel better about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The light bulb that went off in my head was blinding. I needed to communicate to my team members what I was going to do, what it meant and why I was going to do it. The answer was there, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t see it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, I prepared myself for a team meeting to share with them my plans, my reasoning and what it meant for them. The meeting went great, the people were receptive and they were then eager to share with me the details I was seeking. As this change progressed, I became better at coaching, and the open and honest dialogue helped them feel at ease, maybe even a little excited about it. It went better than I had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My learning from this process was two-fold. First, it really helped to talk with someone about the problem I was facing in order to seek input and advice. If you have someone to turn to whom you respect, seek him or her out to compare notes and do it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, if you are changing the way you do something, explain it before you change it. The open dialogue will get your colleagues on your side and allow them to help you make a successful transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/IRxb1ngWOoQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Continue Your Education to See Continuous Improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/8/9/bf0042a8-85c4-4b9f-831d-e573c34798e8_continue education.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left;" /&gt;On my first day in my first job out of college, I discovered technical and business magazines in the bathroom stalls. My supervisor also informed me that I was expected to continue my education while at my desk by boning up on the latest engineering articles and tracking new products. I found out that all of the plant engineering department employees did this within an 8-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company was sending a powerful message that learning was continuous and the company had a responsibility to the employees to help them grow. I found that employees were taking college courses in a variety of disciplines including business, art, history, religion and marketing. The company believed that any expansion of the employees&amp;rsquo; horizons made a better person and, hence, a better employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since that job years ago, I have carried that philosophy throughout my career. Life is the career, and work is only a portion of it. If we are to have balance in our life careers, all parts must grow if one part grows, but how does that carry over to the workplace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most companies encourage continuing education with courses that are job-related. Would a course in Eastern religion be job-related? Think about the diverse workforce. How about a course in pottery making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I had an employee who was a workaholic and did not know how to relax nor did he have a hobby. He asked if the company would allow him time off each week to attend a pottery class and would I pay for it. The answer was yes, and he found that he had a talent for &amp;ldquo;throwing bowls.&amp;rdquo; He came to work a bit different &amp;mdash; more relaxed and less stressed. He had a hobby. Fellow employees and clients found a different, worldlier person who began and quit the work day with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the first exposure to magazines in the stall through a company-paid master&amp;rsquo;s degree and multitudes of growth experiences, I have come to believe that not only must our horizons be expanded, but we must focus on growing the individual, with the faith that out of that effort will come a different employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/Ks87MyQ9oNY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Talent Management Drives Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Business managers have a tendency to view employees as investments that are necessary to complete projects. However, many workplace psychology experts argue that the most effective corporate leaders take a more humane approach to management. By investing in human capital, these leaders not only build positive relationships with their workers but also increase their professional abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ben Bernanke, in his &amp;ldquo;Principles of Macroeconomics,&amp;rdquo; writes that human capital is &amp;ldquo;an amalgam of factors such as education, experience, training, intelligence, energy, work habits, trustworthiness, and initiative.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In theory, the success of a company is dependent upon the number of employees with a high level of workplace competence; as such, each worker should be viewed as a valuable asset. Human capital investment refers to the development of employees who are competent at their jobs, committed to the work and able to meaningfully contribute within their company. Managers who invest in human capital are more likely to earn support from employees and retain their services in the long term. However, simply spending money on behalf of employees is ineffective; the investments must serve the employee by optimizing their talents and increasing their workplace accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arguably the broadest and most commonplace form of human capital investment is job training. The nature of job training often reflects the industry in which it is implemented. Ultimately, the goal of any training is to create skilled laborers who can accomplish tasks much more quickly and efficiently than unskilled laborers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In lieu of job training, some companies invest in collegiate education for their employees. The recipients of this training and educational opportunities are often determined using a cost-benefit analysis, during which the overall cost of the investment is weighed against the potential improvement of the employee &amp;ndash; and returns for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to fostering positive relations between employers and skilled workers, Osmond Vitez of Demand Media notes there are other advantages to training and educating employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using education and training to improve human labor helps companies create a competitive advantage, as when companies train employees to produce goods or services not available from other businesses,&amp;rdquo; he writes. &amp;ldquo;Business owners and managers with specific technical skills can train employees to duplicate processes effectively and efficiently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Job training and other educational opportunities represent a monetary investment in human capital. Cori Hill, director of high-potential leadership development at PDI Ninth House and co-author of &amp;ldquo;Developing Leaders and Organizations Through Action Learning,&amp;rdquo; recently explained to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that investments of time are also crucial for human capital development. Business leaders are essentially responsible for building talent within their company&amp;rsquo;s workforce. But in many cases, they fail to set aside the requisite amount of time for coaching their employees and developing their talents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hill says that managers should adopt a personable approach to leadership and foster a positive working environment in which vulnerability is viewed as a universal trait and mistakes are seen as learning opportunities. The manager should consult with each worker about his or her professional goals, both within the company and in the long term. They should also discuss areas where the employee needs to improve, as well as their important role in the company&amp;rsquo;s overall success. This type of open communication allows employees to become more confident, competent and career-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Human resource management is not a static concept. People are dynamic, and so the ways in which business managers relate to their employees are also constantly changing. But as long as experts emphasize the importance of human capital investment, companies who follow suit will continue to prosper at the hands of their highly skilled and content workforce. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Making Successful Hiring Decisions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Talent management is more than a business buzz phrase. It refers to the process of recruiting, hiring and retaining right-fit, top performers for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all know that turnover at all levels is costly and can destroy any chances for making a profit. According to Kevin Klinvex, co-founder of Select International Inc., the latest figures show that it costs as much as 30 times a person&amp;rsquo;s salary to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is generally accepted that one element of lean operations is waste reduction. Transforming your organization into a talent management organization means utilizing efficient people management processes that eliminate waste in the form of turnover, ultimately giving you the ability to direct more money to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations hire business trainers and consultants to assist them in improving their people management practices, usually requesting strategies and tactics for right-fit hiring. However, right-fit hiring is the second step in transitioning to a talent management organization. To ensure that you get the most value from the process, it is necessary to begin with attracting and recruiting right-fit talent. This means attracting talent that is right-fit for your culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culture: The philosophy underlying all decisions and actions that reinforce the image of the company, or simply put, &amp;ldquo;The way we do things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A total of 20,000 interviews were conducted by the Saratoga Institute, and seven reasons were identified for employee turnover. The top two were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Job or workplace was not as expected.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Mismatch between job and person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Attracting and hiring for your culture is not as complicated as you may think. The key strategy for recruiting and attracting right-fit employees is to communicate your culture prior to the interview. To accomplish this, marketing materials must reflect the elements of your culture, representing your employee dynamics, and utilizing language and symbols that are strong representations of your culture and your brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the Walt Disney Company is probably one of the best in the world at attracting and hiring right-fit employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/7/31/58b69d30-2b83-4ede-a807-a3c214461757_disney.jpeg" style="width: 400px; height: 265px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When you look at the picture above, you see two of the most recognizable icons in the world: the Cinderella castle and Mickey Mouse. These symbols represent the Walt Disney Company, its culture and brand identity. If you were considering applying for a job at Walt Disney World and the ad contained this picture, you would likely make a judgment decision at this point as to whether this environment (culture) was right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Disney also makes strategic use of language. For instance, when hosting a hiring campaign, Disney will use phrases that speak to the friendly dynamics of its employees (cast members).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One newspaper ad read, &amp;ldquo;Make new friends and become part of the friendliest cast on Earth! Get your dream job and create magic for our guests at Walt Disney World today!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These words and phrases are intended to attract the right person to the company. If, as a potential new hire, you think the words &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;dream job&amp;rdquo; sound ridiculous, you are less likely to pursue a job at Walt Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nordstrom&amp;rsquo;s, Ritz Carlton Hotels and Southwest Airlines are examples of other premier organizations that use this process to attract right-fit employees. Ritz Carlton utilizes phrases such as &amp;ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen,&amp;rdquo; alluding to the fact that they hire ladies and gentlemen, not just employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employing the strategy of communicating your culture prior to interviewing results in a certain percentage of applicants self-selecting out of the process. Walt Disney World has found that approximately 10 percent of applicants self-select out of the process, reducing waste in the form of human resources and time by avoiding non-productive interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So before you begin your next hiring process, be sure to focus on the key strategy of recruiting and attracting right-fit employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/46Yyse5R4nQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Developing the Abilities of the Maintenance Manager</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s environment of reliability excellence, integrated maintenance/operations teams, new technologies and constant pressure to make maintenance more effective and elevate it to a prominent value-added position, the maintenance manager must become a business unit manager with equal footing with other plant functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance managers operate a business within a business. They have 24-hour/seven-days-a-week responsibility, a product to deliver, customers, resource allocations, planning, people development responsibilities, political acumen, accountability and drive. They also have the highest-trained workforce with a lot of untapped talent and creativity. What should this professional manager have in his backpack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the last 10 years of my career at the United States Postal Service, I sponsored a maintenance leadership mentoring program that was designed to improve and expand the abilities of our managers to meet the demands of today and tomorrow. We strived to first develop leaders, then business managers and finally maintenance management professionals. Each two-year class had 10 mentors matched with 10 prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;s who were not from the same plant. They met together for eight weekly workshops over two years. All 20 people experienced the same training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A full year of meetings and activities was devoted to the understanding of self and interpersonal effectiveness. Various methods were used to help the manager learn about himself and to understand diversity in others. In group discussions and by using psychologists, they discovered how they could become effective in leading, persuading and managing others as well as themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the first year, they were immersed in formal classes on the business of business (marketing, accounting, economics, strategy and quantitative management). It is imperative to be able to converse with other functions in non-maintenance terms using their business lingo. When not in the classroom, workshops were held on process management, maintenance control, metrics, best maintenance practices and specific areas unique to each individual&amp;rsquo;s development needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They also subscribed to business magazines and attended professional society meetings and conferences. This was followed up with two weeks of reliability excellence training and with each individual taking the certified plant maintenance manager&amp;rsquo;s exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The awareness of self and the business of business were prescribed as foundation activities to build upon. Using this foundation and the expectations developed from the best maintenance processes, each person developed his or her own unique individual development plan to be completed in the two-year program. During the two-year program, these people also performed as operations supervisors for 90 days in their own plant and as maintenance managers for 90 days in another plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Probably the most controversial session was about civility or how the manager presents himself/herself in various settings. This ranged from table manners and writing thank-you notes to professional appearance and proper English. The mentors named it &amp;ldquo;the charm school session.&amp;rdquo; However, all participants were grateful they were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mentors were nominated from their specific regions and received special training on mentoring. Most important was the concept that people are responsible for their own growth. While mentors fulfilled many roles, their prime efforts were to facilitate the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; finding his or her answers. The best mentors were great storytellers and able to relate experiences from which the prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; could glean information for his or her individual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Very few managers have the privilege to participate in such a program, yet the basic tenants hold true &amp;mdash; self, business acumen, process orientation, continuous personal growth and development of others. Industry needs the best trained and highly motivated workforce possible. Managers of today should work continuously to grow that environment in their companies. This responsibility lies with functional management; the human resources function acts to support (not own) the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is within a manager&amp;rsquo;s authority to institute a learning environment. The managers at the top must set the example and truly believe in their own growth and that of their employees. They must walk the talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/mNqWPeJ3B1A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicating Effectively During Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I have never been known to be musically inclined, but I can recognize a great song when I hear one. One of these great songs is &amp;ldquo;I Heard It through the Grapevine.&amp;rdquo; This particular song has been recorded and re-recorded numerous times over the years by many different artists, and although it may bring thoughts of animated raisins to people in my generation, it is more closely associated with Marvin Gaye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I heard it through the grapevine,&lt;br /&gt;
	Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;m just about to lose my mind,&lt;br /&gt;
	Honey, honey, yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as the grapevine in this song had a strong impact, the communication grapevine remains an extremely powerful medium for corporate communications. The effectiveness of grapevine communication and its use &amp;ndash; both intentional and unintentional &amp;ndash; should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When coaching clients during major change initiatives, we continuously stress the importance of effective communication. Experience has shown that clients who struggle to communicate also struggle to successfully implement major change. Even post-project analysis of very successful projects often finds the company could have communicated more frequently and effectively at some point in the project.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the key success factors in successfully implementing a major change initiative is creating a comprehensive change-management strategy and then integrating it into the project-management plan. Creating a communication plan is one of the most critical elements contained within this change-management strategy. In this plan you identify target audiences, determine key messages, choose the preferred sender and select the appropriate communication channel for that message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The majority of communication channels typically chosen are formal communication channels. The communication channel that is often forgotten is the informal communication channel, and this brings us to the topic of the infamous grapevine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	So what is the grapevine, how does it work and how can you use it to effectively communicate during major change? I am sure that the grapevine is as old as time itself, but I will discuss its context within modern organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Grapevine Decoded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every organization has both an informal and formal organizational structure as well as formal and informal communications. Simply stated, the grapevine is a type of informal communication channel. It&amp;rsquo;s all about people communicating directly with other people outside official channels of communication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Your background and experience influence how you view concepts. For example, my background in electronics and submarine nuclear power often leads me to relate concepts to equations to enhance understanding. Personal experiences over the years related to the grapevine can also be translated and simplified into an equation to help us understand how the grapevine works. The amount of communication or &amp;ldquo;chatter&amp;rdquo; on the grapevine can be explained by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Grapevine Chatter = Information Void + WIIFM + Recent News + Insecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_374S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Information Void&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" id="cke_bm_374E" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The laws of supply and demand apply equally to grapevine chatter and economics. An information void exists when the information demanded exceeds the information supplied. The supply and the demand of the information are not defined by the organization but by the individual person who desires the information. An information void will be filled with something &amp;ndash; either rumors or valid information. The larger the information void, the greater the amount of chatter in the grapevine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	WIIFM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What&amp;rsquo;s in it for me (WIIFM) seems to show up in many places when we are talking about organizational change. Regardless of the situation, when change occurs our natural tendency is to translate this into a WIIFM context. This is what you are listening for. How does this change affect me, my pay, my family, my free time, etc.? Whether that WIIFM is good or bad, it creates a vested interest. When people have a vested interest, they will want information. The greater the impact on WIIFM, the greater the amount of chatter on the grapevine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Recent News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are stunned at how breaking news hits the grapevine at breakneck speed. Even something as simple as an office remodeling (occurring in our offices right now) can generate significant grapevine chatter. The fresher the story, the greater the chatter on the grapevine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impact of the WIIFM factor is exponentially compounded by the level of insecurity that exists. The greater the amount of insecurity that exists within the organization, the greater the amount of chatter that will exist on the grapevine. For example, with the current fragile state of the economy, one can easily see how this factor can become extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/9/be929b27-bfce-4dfc-99a3-3b178067850b_Communicate effectively image.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 161px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Rumors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As stated earlier, an information void will be filled. When the desire for information is high and the number of facts that are known is low, the number of rumors flying is huge. Most of us have experienced this firsthand, and sometimes it is not a pretty sight. Regaining control of information in the midst of flying rumors is extremely difficult. The longer a rumor is allowed to fly, the more difficult it is to replace it with valid information. While some people try to fight rumor with rumor, the only effective way to combat rumor is with facts. When a large number of rumors exist, an even larger number of facts must be communicated to combat the rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Leveraging the Grapevine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing the factors that make up grapevine chatter &amp;ndash; information voids, WIIFM, recent news and insecurity &amp;ndash; you can proactively intervene with frequent and effective communication. Fill information voids with accurate information before rumors materialize. Proactively communicate when breaking news is expected. When information (such as impending mergers and acquisitions) is about to be communicated, be prepared and react quickly after the message is released. When communicating change initiatives, ensure that you communicate the impact of the change on the individual.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Addressing the factors associated with grapevine chatter can minimize but never totally eliminate the amount of informal communication occurring. However, by better understanding the grapevine, you can successfully leverage it as part of your overall communication strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the tenets of a good communication strategy is evaluating the effectiveness of your communication. This is accomplished by obtaining feedback. What better way to gather feedback than to take advantage of an existing channel of communication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Tapping into the Grapevine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the course of my career, I have been able to tap into the grapevine at your typical places &amp;mdash; the water cooler (scuttlebutt in Navy terminology), the coffee pot and the smoke break area. Tapping into the grapevine is not normally achieved overnight. Grapevine communicators are a very selective bunch. They will not share all information with everyone. There must be some level of relationship and trust established, and building relationships and trust takes time. To accomplish this, you must get out of the office, talk to people and most of all listen.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	But while the traditional grapevine is thought of as being a face-to-face or oral type of communication, this is no longer the case. Advances in technology and recent trends in social networking have significantly transformed the modern grapevine. Informal communication now occurs through email, texting, Twitter and on social-networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementing major change in an organization is a complex and challenging task. In the end, creating organizational change is about cumulatively creating change in individuals. Successfully leading major change requires successfully leading individuals. To successfully lead individuals through change, you must be able to communicate effectively. You must find new ways to connect to people and communicate in every imaginable way. That includes tapping into the grapevine. Without it, you just might lose your mind. Honey, honey, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Know Your Expectations When Introducing Change </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You can be forgiven if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize Arnold Vosloo&amp;rsquo;s name. In fact, you have to be a bit of a movie buff to have a chance at this one &amp;ndash; and by movie buff, I mean you don&amp;rsquo;t leave the theater until the credits display key grip or you know what C.S.A. stands for. For the non-buffs, Vosloo is the actor who played the character &amp;ldquo;Imhotep&amp;rdquo; in the 1999 movie &amp;ldquo;The Mummy&amp;rdquo; (i.e., he played the mummy). In the category of &amp;ldquo;Best Portrayal of a Resurrected Supporting Actor or Actress&amp;rdquo; (not yet a category, but under consideration), Vosloo is an Oscar shoe-in. He is also a brilliant change agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the filming of &amp;ldquo;The Mummy,&amp;rdquo; director Stephen Sommers was providing Vosloo with a deeper understanding of his character. Mummified almost 5,000 years ago, Imhotep has been resurrected by accident, and a number of steps are required to allow him to fully rematerialize. During the re-materialization steps, Imhotep gains increasing control of his body. This control is achieved in discrete steps, based upon his acquiring the necessary elements for full resurrection &amp;ndash; elements such as organs, a human sacrifice, skin, etc. As he acquires these elements, he becomes less zombie-like and more human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Director Sommers was offering this information as constructive coaching to Vosloo in how these elements would affect his character&amp;rsquo;s motor skills and therefore Vosloo&amp;rsquo;s on-screen portrayal of the character. As a director, Sommers understood what he meant and what he wanted. Vosloo, however, was stumped. Finally, he went for the change management jugular and simply stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just show me what you want me to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In change, we often focus on the high-level, organizational aspects of the change such as the background, business drivers, financials, benefits or results &amp;ndash; i.e., reduced cost, employee engagement, increased sales, etc. These results or benefits, however, are the end result of individuals doing things differently. What is surprising is how often a change is introduced to the organization without defining the specifics of the new behaviors. This is not to imply that change can be mandated. Knowing what we want people to do and getting them to do it are not the same thing. It is important, however, to know what we want them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This may seem like common sense, yet the majority of the change efforts I have been involved in tend to be surprisingly vague on specifics. I picture myself as the affected employee and ask the question, &amp;ldquo;What do you want me to do?&amp;rdquo; Guidance such as &amp;ldquo;be more efficient&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;reduce costs&amp;rdquo; are not as helpful as you would think. Direction to &amp;ldquo;perform root-cause analysis on 100 percent of failures&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;record 100 percent of customer calls in the CRM system&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;talk weekly with five operators about machine-specific issues&amp;rdquo; is pretty direct and gets to the root of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vosloo was lucky. Sommers adapted his style to Vosloo&amp;rsquo;s needs and demonstrated what he was describing, and &amp;ldquo;The Mummy&amp;rdquo; was born. So in your change efforts, be prepared for the Vosloos of the world. Know what you expect and be prepared to explain the specifics. As an additional perk, you will also be able to remain calm when a 5,000-year-old skinless zombie asks for help.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Involve the Right People for Effective Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&amp;rdquo; the white rabbit is eternally behind schedule and skittishly hyperactive. What is easily overlooked is his firm grasp of the subtle intricacies of effective change management. For example, he off-handedly advises Alice, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something, stand there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although this statement initially appears counterintuitive &amp;ndash; after all, much of formal change management is getting individuals to actually do things differently &amp;ndash; the change will only be effective when the right people do the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oftentimes during change, so much emphasis is placed on end results that we take shortcuts on the way those end results are achieved. For instance, during a recent engagement, a client was implementing a new process for the operators to follow. To meet the expectation of a speedy implementation, the area manager intended to provide the process training to the operators. On the surface, that might not sound like a bad idea. However, by doing so, the manager was missing a valuable opportunity to engage the line supervisors in the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When questioned, the area manager felt that the line supervisors were not as familiar with the new process as she was and would not be able to provide effective training. Once she said it out loud, she realized that she would be better off taking time to train the supervisors and leverage them to train and coach the employees on the new processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During another implementation, visual control boards were being installed at each manufacturing cell. The operators were made responsible for filling out the hourly production totals. As expected, some operators were filling out the boards consistently, while others were, shall we say, less consistent. The change-management facilitator assigned to the project took the opportunity to show the operators how to fill out the information correctly. The question posed to the facilitator was, &amp;ldquo;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t the supervisor addressing this?&amp;rdquo; The response was, &amp;ldquo;They are very busy, and I just want to help them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the facilitator&amp;rsquo;s dedication is admirable, the truth is that unless the supervisors take ownership of their operators&amp;rsquo; performance, this change is doomed to early failure. In this case, the facilitator should observe but take no direct action. The next step would be to share his observations with the sponsor and create a plan to coach the supervisors on performance expectations and additional training on what to look for and how to address deficiencies. This effectively transfers ownership of the process to the appropriate individuals and greatly increases the potential for effective, sustained change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taken literally, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something, stand there&amp;rdquo; is overly simplistic. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to do nothing but to think through the process and make sure that the right things are getting done the right way. Whoa &amp;hellip; gotta go. They are calling for final boarding, and I&amp;rsquo;m late, I&amp;rsquo;m late&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Reliability Reduces Waste of Time, Talent and Resources</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Waste is seen in many different forms in manufacturing. Some of these wastes include physical, time and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Physical waste is anything that is left over from the process that has to be discarded, recycled or sold. For every process, there is an expected amount of waste that is unavoidable. However, the waste that we will focus on is the excess waste that is produced because of equipment or process reliability issues. There are many processes that are a one-shot process, where if it is interrupted during the process, all of the materials become waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time waste also directly relates to equipment and process reliability. Any time that the system is down for unplanned maintenance, that means there is extra time required to make up the work, idle manpower and manpower required to correct the deficiency. In many cases, the extra time required to make up the work falls into overtime or extra shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Talent waste is the use of time and education to repair or correct process or equipment failures. There will always be the need for the use of talent to fix failures. The real loss is when the failures are preventable and nothing is being done to change the situation. The talent used to fix unnecessary equipment failures can be utilized to improve the process and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Any angle from which you look at reliability will reveal that it is a necessary function to be a good steward of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/2PusA6Aoh94" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Know Where You Are Going for Successful Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Early in his change-management career, Yogi Berra was advising a professional sports organization in New York on some of the finer points of managing change. At the executive briefing, Berra delivered his change-management theory overview, which he summed up in this single statement: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;ve got to be very careful if you don&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;re going, because you might end up someplace else.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Apparently, the executive board was impressed because they extended his engagement an additional 14 years. Although his actual change consulting career was short lived, Berra did highlight one of the most critical aspects of successful change &amp;ndash; knowing where you&amp;rsquo;re going. In organizational change, where you&amp;rsquo;re going is usually summed up in business terms: lower cost, higher quality, greater customer satisfaction, etc. These objectives, however, are the results of specific, repeated behaviors. How change truly occurs is by getting people in the organization to identify and consistently execute activities that produce the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Intellectually we know this. We are familiar with the definition of insanity as &amp;ldquo;doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,&amp;rdquo; so we know that to get different results we have to do things differently. The issue is that we tend to spend much of our effort on defining the results (KPIs, dashboards, measurements, etc.) and less effort on clearly identifying the necessary behaviors. However, without the consistent behaviors, the improved results are not possible.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In working with organizations undertaking transformational change, one of the first steps in planning the change is to clearly link the desired business results with the necessary behavior changes and then design the change to create the behaviors. This is a relatively simple exercise that is best done as a group activity with the leadership team.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Create a list of all the business results that are expected from the change. The more managers that can be involved, the better, since this will accomplish two objectives. The first is that this allows the managers the opportunity to express their expectations in a public and productive manner. The second is that they will be able to see how multiple business goals inter-relate. This list should be detailed and fairly extensive.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Identify the specific changes that are necessary to accomplish the business results identified in Step 1. Again, this list should be detailed and fairly extensive. Each item listed in Step 1 may have three to five or more specific changes. Examples would be to &amp;ldquo;perform root cause analysis on 100 percent of failures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Identify the specific behaviors associated with the changes identified in Step 2. This will also include behavior changes for executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Again, there will be multiple behavior changes for each specific change identified in Step 2.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The ultimate success of the change will depend on how successfully the organization is able to create these necessary behavior changes. Many organizations make the mistake of diving into the change effort without taking the time to clearly identify these behaviors. By taking the time to create the detailed links between the business results and the specific behavior changes, you will now know where you are going so you don&amp;rsquo;t end up somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/ICY4T8JxUnc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>4 Steps to Learn New Skills in Less Time</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Business changes require that we effectively learn new processes and skills in less time. With the influx of a new workforce and the imminent exit of our most experienced workers, we need to document expertise so that it can become institutional knowledge. In this article, we explore a four-step kick-start that can help you capture the critical elements needed for a course in minimal time. After completing the four steps, a learning organization can prioritize development without losing vital intellectual capital.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Life Cycle Institute believes that learning is a process of alignment, assimilation and application &amp;mdash; alignment on learning goals and documenting expectations, participation in a learning event designed and delivered for how adults learn, and application of learning on the job. The four-step process described in this article is used to help ensure that the assimilate phase results in learning transfer and leads the learner to apply new understanding and to produce desired outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Designing and developing a course normally follows a process called ADDIE, which stands for analyze, design, develop, implement and evaluate. Inside the ADDIE process, different methods are used to complete one phase and move onto the next. The four steps in this article come after the analysis phase and help move the project from the design phase to the develop phase.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The four steps to kick-start a learning design are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Learning objectives&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Content chunking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Activity selection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sequence course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Learning Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What do you want learners to be able to do after the class? Objectives normally complete the phrase, &amp;ldquo;After the class, the learner will be able to....&amp;rdquo; For example, &amp;ldquo;After the class, the learner will be able to create a new material master form in SAP.&amp;rdquo; Learning objectives are the foundational element of the course design. You may find that much time is spent trying to reach consensus on what the learning objectives should be. This is appropriate because every decision made about the course will be based on the learning objectives. If proposed content or activities do not contribute to achieving the learning objective, they should not be included in the learning design.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are several approaches available to help write the objectives, including SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) and ABCD (audience, behavior, condition, degree). Bloom&amp;rsquo;s revised taxonomy can also help you make a decision about learning objectives. It is based on action words that clearly describe the type of behavior you would like to see after the training. For example, if you want someone to be able to communicate the benefits of a new program, a learning objective might be, &amp;ldquo;Discuss the value that reliability excellence can bring to an organization.&amp;rdquo; Try to keep the learning objectives specific so that it is easy to determine what type of content and activities you will need to reach them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Content Chunking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determine the main subjects or topics that are &amp;ldquo;need to know&amp;rdquo; to achieve the learning objectives. These main subjects should be high-level words or short phrases that describe the main points of the major modules in the course. We normally take each learning objective and quickly jot down the core content components essential to being able to perform at the level of the learning objective. Normally, these first impressions of subjects are the most &amp;ldquo;pure,&amp;rdquo; meaning they don&amp;rsquo;t include excessive amounts of &amp;ldquo;nice to know&amp;rdquo; information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Activity Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How will you get learners to work with the content? Each topic should have some sort of interaction, some way that the participant is working with the information. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Bloom&amp;rsquo;s to help define your objectives, the activity should match the Bloom&amp;rsquo;s level of the learning objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Sequence Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you&amp;rsquo;ve defined content and activity ideas, you should sequence content and activities to get an idea of flow.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To ensure that all four elements are defined in a cohesive, efficient manner, schedule a meeting with the design partner and interested stakeholders to define the four elements. Depending on the scope of the training, these meetings may last from two hours to an entire day. The deliverable from this meeting is a document that comprises the critical elements needed to develop a course.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are five primary benefits to this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The essential elements of the course are defined in one meeting, speeding time to development.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Portions of the course can be divided and prioritized between team members to capitalize on available resources.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Design team members agree on the content and activities expected, so a level of effort can be anticipated and the &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not my action item&amp;rdquo; mindset is limited.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Design team members can more easily schedule time to develop when working on multiple projects.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communication and internal/external marketing for the course can start immediately, jump-starting any change-management efforts for mandatory or new initiative-based training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To organize and document the four-step design process, use a grid-like template to help sequence content and activities and give you a picture of the day. This could be captured in many different ways, including using a smartboard, a tablet or marker boards and flip charts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Below is one example of how you can organize your content and activities in one place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/10/83fcbb2e-2001-4464-a71a-b019e3c00ae4_design.jpeg" style="width: 490px; height: 247px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the four steps are documented, they make a course map that guides the rest of the project. This is an early design document, so elements of this course summary may change. However, as long as the learning objectives do not change drastically, neither does your summary.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Defining the four steps critical to course design up front provides benefits early in the course-development process for team members and potential learners alike. These benefits include early buy-in from team members and stakeholders, more efficient resource scheduling, clearer expectations and level of effort for team members, and early awareness for potential learners.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Don't be the Grinch Who Resists Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It is starting to feel a lot like Christmas. The tree is decorated, stockings are hung over the fireplace, and Christmas carols fill the airwaves. This is all good and cheery, but what really makes it feel like Christmas is trying to memorize 15 songs for our Singing Christmas Tree this year, scheduling travel to see family, and Christmas shopping for my wife and three girls, including a 15-year-old who thinks that &amp;ldquo;any new car would be fine.&amp;rdquo; Needing something to cheer me up, I turn on &amp;ldquo;The Grinch&amp;rdquo; and realize two things: First, deep down, part of me secretly empathizes with him. Second, there is an important change message in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Christmas in Whoville approaches, our old buddy Mr. Grinch is exhibiting some resistant behavior &amp;ndash; appearing supportive while engaging in active sabotage, co-opting others to resist (although I am not sure his dog was as helpful as expected) and numerous other nefarious activities. As we deal with resistance, it is important to remember that people change for their reasons, not yours. In this case, our herculean humbug finds his own reason to change in the combination of two powerful realizations &amp;ndash; that what we do makes a difference and our contribution is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Change is often presented as a technical exercise &amp;ndash; implementing a new process, changing roles, acquiring a company, etc. While this is all well and good logically, it usually fails to create an emotional connection and makes the change seem like a lot of tedious work. Enlightened leaders know that there is a natural desire to be part of something larger than ourselves and will craft the message to reinforce a sense of purpose. Linking the change to a larger purpose, such as saving lives, protecting our families, being good stewards of our world, etc., makes the change seem less daunting. Making a positive impact takes work, but I&amp;rsquo;m up for the task. The Grinch became aware that the spirit of Christmas was more important than the trappings, hence the heart two sizes too small was transformed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, our verdigris villain finds the other side of the change coin &amp;ndash; that my contribution is important. Once we link ourselves to the bigger picture, we look for where we fit. When each person can see how their contribution fits into the larger context, engagement increases. The Grinch realized that he could make a positive contribution to Whoville happiness, and his personal desire to engage in the change was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you really want to engage your organization, make an effort to reinforce the sense of purpose and show people where they fit. By the way, if one of your change sponsors is abnormally green and lives in a cave, don&amp;rsquo;t assume that public support is the same as commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Strategies for Overcoming Resistance to Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Will Rogers was one of the most revered public figures in the early 1900s, and much of his popularity was due to his tremendous understanding of and connection with people. As a keen student of human nature, Rogers unsurprisingly identified a fundamental key to successful change in his statement: &amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t what we don&amp;rsquo;t know that gives us trouble; it&amp;rsquo;s what we know that ain&amp;rsquo;t so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How many changes have been hampered by individuals who rigidly hold onto the current state because of something they &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that ain&amp;rsquo;t so? For example, when U.S. auto manufacturers first observed lean production, they refused to believe their own eyes. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t build cars that way &amp;mdash; not enough inventory.&amp;rdquo; They struggled to understand a world that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit into their view of reality even when faced with clear evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our collection of deep-seated beliefs and assumptions create our view of the world. Often these beliefs and assumptions are so deep-seated that we don&amp;rsquo;t realize they are in play. When faced with evidence that conflicts with our beliefs, we look for flaws in the evidence rather than flaws in our beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This collection of beliefs and assumptions create our paradigm or view of the world and can be painfully difficult to change. When taking an organization through change, it is important to accept that much of the resistance that occurs can be traced to the inherent difficulty in releasing paradigms. As enlightened change agents, we need to understand paradigms and how best to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Paradigms are held in place by three factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Background &amp;ndash; What one has been taught and accepts as true (e.g., &amp;ldquo;The world is flat.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Experience &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;This is the way I have always done it,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If it ain&amp;rsquo;t broke, don&amp;rsquo;t fix it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Knowledge &amp;ndash; New information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often we attempt to change paradigms solely through new information, such as when the car executives toured the lean production plant. Since their background and manufacturing experience conflicted with this new information, they challenged the information as incomplete or inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other end of the spectrum, a person&amp;rsquo;s background is built over his lifetime, so short of going back in time to make changes (or the onset of amnesia), there is not much promise of changing paradigms there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That leaves the middle factor &amp;mdash; experience. This is where we get the most powerful element in changing a paradigm. Once someone has a new experience that disproves their assumption, they can no longer argue with the evidence. If you get creative, you can almost always find a way to provide a new experience that can effectively change a paradigm, even when faced with a strong resistance to change. Some strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;1. &amp;ldquo;Just try it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Often we don&amp;rsquo;t need you to believe it or agree with it &amp;mdash; just try it. Fear of the unknown is a powerful obstacle. Just make it easy for them to try it and see what the results are. When implementing visual control boards in a plant, the operators were pushing back. The enlightened supervisor appealed to the operators with: &amp;ldquo;Just give it a try. We&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose, and we may learn something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; 2. &amp;ldquo;Give it your best shot.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Appealing to a person&amp;rsquo;s ego can be a powerful factor. Consider the example of the experienced mechanic who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use the new laser alignment tool. The enlightened supervisor appealed to the mechanic&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem with the request: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re my top mechanic. I would like you to use the new procedure. Give me your best effort, and let&amp;rsquo;s see what the results are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;3. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s learn together.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A consultant was brought in to help a plant reduce changeover times. The supervisor (unsurprisingly) resisted. The consultant proposed: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s videotape the changeover, and then we will review it together. If we don&amp;rsquo;t find any opportunities, then so be it.&amp;rdquo; Needless to say, the supervisor found all sorts of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many times, change is approached with a heaping dose of 1950s parental encouragement, i.e., &amp;ldquo;Because I said so.&amp;rdquo; Maybe not intentionally or with those words, but the eagerness to get things moving often leaves insufficient room to let people learn for themselves. By changing the process to include discovery and experience, you build successes and momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Proper Training Can Increase Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I recently had the opportunity to make a first visit to a new client&amp;rsquo;s site. As you would expect, upon arrival I was required to attend the contractor/vendor safety orientation training before I could be set loose in the site facilities. This client site was in the Deep South, and our instructor for the training was the site safety coordinator, a local gentleman who had been employed in or around the area all his life. With his Southern drawl, he said everything about three times. (I could never quite figure out if he wanted to make sure we &amp;ldquo;got it,&amp;rdquo; or if he just liked saying everything at least three times.) I recall that the training was very good and to the point, and everyone in the training session was fully aware of all the safety rules and all the potential hazards of the site.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Why was this safety orientation training required by the client site? First, there is an OSHA requirement that everyone be trained in the real and potential hazards of the site before they can be allowed into the site. Second, and more importantly, statistics show that the overall number of workplace injuries and deaths has decreased significantly since we started putting more focus on workplace safety and injury prevention. Basically, the training we receive makes us more aware and more careful in the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Businesses today are consumed with demands from shareholders and owners to decrease costs while making more products at a higher profit. You can decrease costs in many ways, but most people realize that you cannot cut your way to prosperity. Whatever you might cut out of your budget today in many cases will have to be replaced in kind at some point in the future. I have seen too many examples of cost-cutting where the first thing to go is people. The second is training, and the third is investment in proper maintenance of assets.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We want our businesses to be profitable, and to do that our assets must be reliable. Every operating asset must operate as designed for the period we schedule it to run without failure. We can spend money to replace, upgrade, repair or otherwise make our assets reliable, but without the expertise to keep them in that reliable condition, we are in a never-ending cycle of &amp;ldquo;run, fix, run, fix&amp;rdquo; until there is no life remaining in the assets or the people. If our operators and maintenance people are not doing the right things at the right time, our reliability surely will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One thing you can do to get out of this cycle is to make sure your maintenance and operations employees have the knowledge and can get the experience needed to sustain your assets at a high level of reliability. You can decide to train your people in-house, using experienced craftsmen and operators as trainers. This can work very well, assuming that you have made the right choices in the teachers/mentors/coaches you assign to your new employees. If the people you select as teachers have learned any bad habits during their tenure, they may pass along those bad habits to the new people. If the teacher has not been able to keep up to date on advances in technology and tools, there will be something lacking in the training they pass along. After carefully analyzing the current level of expertise in your organization, you may determine that you need outside help in training your people.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Outside training help can come from any number of resources available in the immediate area of your business. There are technical schools and colleges, factory schools, traveling training and seminars, local vendors or dedicated professional training providers such as the Life Cycle Institute. In an active training environment, using tools such as learning impact maps, your employees can learn the latest in technology and approaches to proper operation and maintenance of plant assets, what to look for, what tools may be used to detect potential problems and, most importantly, why you should be proactive in your approach to reliability of your assets. If your employees know what to do, how to do it and why it is important to do it right the first time, you can more easily achieve the goals of reducing costs to operate and improve your throughput and profit.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Reliability of our assets depends upon the correct operation and maintenance of those assets, as well as our ability to repeat these practices on a daily basis to sustain a high level of reliability. Giving your employees knowledge, experience and an understanding of the value that training brings to the business puts you in a position to gain more market share. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which of your competitors are doing this most effectively. They are the ones at the top of the market share, and they will remain there as long as they can keep their people and their assets operating at a high level of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When your business is not operating as profitably as you need it to, ask &amp;ldquo;What can we do to get better?&amp;rdquo; Constantly analyze your business to determine where you can improve and get an edge on the competition. One of your first questions to ask should be, &amp;ldquo;Are our people doing the right things for the right reasons?&amp;rdquo; Training your people to become better, smarter operators and maintenance people should not be discounted in your analysis. In fact, it should be right at the top of your list. Long-term reliability and improved market share depend upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>3 Keys to Create and Sustain Major Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there is nothing more difficult and dangerous, or more doubtful of success, than an attempt to introduce a new order of things&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;/em&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, &amp;ldquo;The Prince&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Considered by many as the father of modern political science, Niccolo Machiavelli wrote &amp;ldquo;The Prince&amp;rdquo; as practical, if not morally ambiguous, advice on what is necessary for a new prince to establish stable rule &amp;mdash; in other words, how to create and sustain major change. The following excerpt from his book demonstrates Machiavelli&amp;rsquo;s awareness of the difficulty of change and the resistance it can provoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hence it is that, whenever the opponents of the new order of things have the opportunity to attack it, they will do it with the zeal of partisans, whilst the others defend it but feebly, so that it is dangerous to rely upon the latter.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Niccolo Machiavelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This statement says that those who oppose a change will fight it with all they have, while those who support a change will do so without enthusiasm. As a result, leaders must take additional measures to ensure changes are adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his book, Machiavelli directly addresses three core principles of successful change management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Change is a Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Change is not an announcement or an event but a process. As Machiavelli pointed out, it is difficult for people to put their faith in something that they have not experienced. This is why it is critical to have active and visible sponsorship throughout the change. More than one change has found itself floundering because the sponsors observed substantial progress and moved onto the next issue, trusting in &amp;ldquo;momentum&amp;rdquo; to carry it the rest of the way. The reality is that as soon as the sponsors lose visibility, the momentum shifts to the defenders of the old way, and hard-earned gains are soon lost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Expect Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Major change alters power structures, shifts responsibilities and crosses organizational boundaries, which affects real people with real influence. These real people get their real influence from the existing power structures, responsibilities and organizational roles. Therefore, it is dangerous to underestimate the power of the desire to hold onto the current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Machiavelli provided this observation as a reminder that people tend to work in their own self-interest and that the fear of losing something is generally stronger than the hope of gaining something. In other words, don&amp;rsquo;t waste energy wondering why people are resisting and focus your efforts on leading through the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Build Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Left to their own devices, those with power in the old system will actively (though not always visibly) defend the current state, while those who will benefit the most from the new system will tend to be more passive in their support. In writing &amp;ldquo;The Prince,&amp;rdquo; Machiavelli hoped to provide the reader with an understanding of the challenges that lie ahead so that they may be better prepared. Therefore, it is a critical role of the sponsor to work at closing the gap by reducing resistance from the first group and building support from the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Research has shown that major transformational change has only a 30-percent chance of meeting all or most of the expected results. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the success rate was in the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century, but I would venture to guess that the statement &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there is nothing more difficult or dangerous&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is a good indication that it was low even then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While some of Machiavelli&amp;rsquo;s other advice belongs in the Change Agent &amp;ldquo;Wall of Shame&amp;rdquo; category, his observation of the nature, danger and challenge of change is as true today as when it was written 479 years ago. Effective leadership is critical to successful change and requires active sponsorship throughout the change, expecting and managing resistance, and building support.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Finding the Hidden Teachers in Your Organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The only true competitive advantage a company has is its employees&amp;rsquo; ability to learn, grow and change so they can discover, improve, innovate and meet the challenges of a dynamic marketplace. Today&amp;rsquo;s agile companies know that learning and continuous improvement is a priority. &lt;em&gt;Training Magazine&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; 2009 industry report published that the average organization spent approximately $484,000 on training-based investments per year.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Formal instruction, online or in the classroom, is critical to developing talent in your organization. However, formal training is a piece of the learning process. Learning professionals largely agree that 80 percent of learning happens outside of a formal classroom. Some learning leaders think that the amount of informal learning (unstructured learning that happens outside the traditional learning events) drives the percentage even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With so much learning happening every day between leaders, managers, employees and clients, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a closer look at our roles and see how we may function every day as coaches, trainers, knowledge agents and advocates for professional growth and change. Who are the hidden teachers within my organization? How can I harness their ability to produce results and increase benefits to the company&amp;rsquo;s constituents?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at two types of hidden teachers. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore examples of how these hidden teachers might appear in your organization, and a few tips on how to improve their ability to facilitate learning and change in others to produce results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Leader as Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Out of all the possible hidden teachers, a company&amp;rsquo;s leader is paradoxically the most visible. A good leader inspires people and guides them through growth and change to achieve personal and organizational goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the article, &amp;ldquo;Leader as Teacher: Creating the Learning Organization,&amp;rdquo; authors Ronald Heifetz and Donald Laurie discuss the leader as teacher model as critical to a business&amp;rsquo; success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;While businesses today face challenges that can be met by applying technical expertise, they also face challenges that require many people in the organization to learn new habits, attitudes and values&amp;hellip; We should be looking for leaders who can move us to face the problems for which there are no simple, painless solutions &amp;mdash; the challenges that require us to learn new ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concept of leader as teacher doesn&amp;rsquo;t end at executive leadership. The model can benefit team leaders, project leaders, committee leaders and meeting facilitators.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The best leaders are good teachers who orient people&amp;rsquo;s purpose and direction, model behaviors, demonstrate values and provide context for learning and changes necessary for the team or organization&amp;rsquo;s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Subject Matter Expert (SME) as Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An SME knows his or her subject intimately. Although a person may not have the title of SME, subject matter experts exist in many organizations and are frequently asked to share their knowledge with others to enhance competency in a certain area. These folks aren&amp;rsquo;t called &amp;ldquo;trainers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;teachers,&amp;rdquo; but they may teach as part of their regular responsibilities and are seldom in a formal classroom.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A few examples of hidden teacher SMEs that you might find in your company include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A work planning specialist&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A software system &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A business or process consultant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A customer software integration specialist&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A customer support specialist&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A legal or contracts department manager&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A financial or tax auditor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A top-selling product salesperson&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A Six-Sigma black belt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An SME is a knowledge powerhouse whom you would expect to easily transfer knowledge to others. This is not always the case. Because SMEs may not serve in a teaching capacity at all times, they may not have the tools or embrace the methods to effectively facilitate learning and change in others. Do they have the skills to assess and honor the experience level of those they&amp;rsquo;re teaching? Are their sessions active? Do they reinforce relevancy to real-world application, encourage action planning and give people a choice in how they learn?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If your organization uses SMEs to teach others without properly equipping them, the result could be a missed opportunity to enhance the development of an employee or client.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example. Pam is a customer integration specialist. She works for a company that provides software products that are customized for the client. Pam performs the customization. For a certain client, she&amp;rsquo;s asked to deliver and introduce the software to client users. Pam&amp;rsquo;s goal is that the client knows how to utilize the system and embraces its use. She needs to overcome the client&amp;rsquo;s resistance to the new system, unlocking their minds so they are willing to change the way they did things and learn a new way of doing things.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If Pam is effective, her company&amp;rsquo;s software installation has a greater chance of success and the company can gain an advocate client. There is no question that Pam is an SME, but is she prepared to teach a session that incorporates activities, review strategies and retention techniques to facilitate learning and change?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s add another factor to the example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say Pam&amp;rsquo;s clients are expected to train co-workers at other locations on how to use the new system. They are essentially in the same position as Pam. Are they aware of how to most effectively teach others to use the system correctly? Have they been prepped on how to coach other users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Boosting the Effectiveness of Hidden Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the hidden trainers in your organization, here are a few suggestions on how to help the transition to a facilitator of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Self-study: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many great books to support the growth of a hidden teacher, such as &lt;em&gt;Active Training&lt;/em&gt; by Mel Silberman, &lt;em&gt;Telling Ain&amp;rsquo;t Training&lt;/em&gt; by Harold Stolovitch and &lt;em&gt;Presenting with Pizzazz&lt;/em&gt; by Sharon Bowman. Self-study should have discipline and accountability. Learners should document their progress in an action or development plan and ask themselves these questions:&lt;br /&gt;
		a. What action will I take as a result of reading this book?&lt;br /&gt;
		b. What results will I achieve because I took this action?&lt;br /&gt;
		c. How will the results impact the organization?&lt;br /&gt;
		d. When will I implement this action?&lt;br /&gt;
		Ask the learner to target an action that will achieve some sort of result within 90 days.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Individual coaching: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have a well-defined mentor program in your organization, you can pair a mentor with the teacher-to-be. You can also hire a trainer coach to observe, assess and coach the individual. For example, Life Cycle Institute&amp;rsquo;s learning consultants build individual development plans and provide detailed support structures to guide an individual&amp;rsquo;s development.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Train-the-trainer classes: &lt;/strong&gt;There are many train-the-trainer opportunities available. To name a few, the Life Cycle Institute, SkillPath and the Bob Pike Group all offer train-the-trainer workshops. When looking at a course, consider the learning objectives. Is this course designed so that participants can practice the skills they learn in class? Is follow-up coaching after the course an option?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Success story network: &lt;/strong&gt;Look in your organization at those individuals who produce results. What do they do that makes them successful? What are the qualities of that success? Consider building a network where people can learn from each other and share best practices and success stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every organization has hidden teachers with the capacity to motivate employees and clients to adopt new behaviors that produce results. Find the hidden trainers in your organization and provide them the support they need to become great. If you happen to be a hidden trainer reading this article, I encourage you to use the four steps above to guide your transformation to become an agent of learning and change for your co-workers and clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/Jr5JFjVD4vs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Improve Communication within Your Organization</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The communication blitz is a proven approach to communicating key messages effectively throughout an organization. Individuals looking to improve communication within their organization and enhance employee engagement can adopt the easy-to-use process introduced in this article.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	During a large project, when many things are changing, there is an increased need for ongoing communication to all employees. When implementing a continuous-improvement initiative, effectively communicating the changes is essential to success. Change management during a big project is just that &amp;mdash; managing the change itself. The communication blitz provides proactive messages to help manage the change within an organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A large project like an implementation of reliability excellence requires a master plan that includes major tasks and milestones, and a well-designed change-management plan. The change-management plan needs to include a comprehensive communication plan. The communication blitz, a subset of the communication plan, is a series of communications delivered face to face from the leaders who sponsor the change all the way to the hourly employees working at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Prepare to Follow the Sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The approach is simple. First, senior leaders develop a succinct, short message. They then divide up the front-line supervisors into equal groups. The leaders go out into the work areas of the supervisors, discuss this message, seek open discussion and check for retention with the supervisors. This can be done individually or in small groups.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Next, the supervisors meet with their employees in small groups and deliver the same message. After a short period of time, usually around two to four weeks, the leadership group interviews a sample of the hourly employees to determine if they can explain the message. They develop questions specific to the message delivered so that there is a standard approach to talking with the hourly employees. The goal is to have 40 percent retention, meaning that 40 percent of the employees can clearly articulate the message. After attaining 40 percent or better, the next message can be developed, and the cycle begins again. See Illustration 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/dc31566a-a2bd-418f-889f-7506ed36817b_illustration 1a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 532px; height: 435px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Forty percent is the minimum number of people who should have a strong understanding of the messages to make sure the communications are getting through. This dramatically improves the likelihood of the changes taking hold. When scoring the retention, it is a good idea to develop a matrix of the key questions and the list of employees who received the message. See Illustration 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/b9f92761-27cb-4dd4-8aba-990316740845_illustration 2a.jpeg" style="width: 648px; height: 284px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to document how well the employees have retained the message. Talking to a few people to get a gut check is too subjective to make sure the message was well received. Using this simple matrix helps to make sure that the desired outcome has in fact occurred. When actually scoring the retention, three levels of response should be expected &amp;ndash; full recall, some recall or no recall. Two people are usually involved in conducting the review &amp;mdash; the top site manager and the project leader. This typically requires two 2-hour sessions, carrying a clipboard with the questions and any additional information that you would like to leave with each person interviewed.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	From this example, we can analyze how well the message has been retained and communicated back during the evaluation. Reviewing this scorecard example (the totals per person down the right side and then totals per question across the bottom) reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the results. Reviewing the scores of the people indicates the &amp;ldquo;operator&amp;rdquo; has low understanding. Further review with other operators should be conducted to determine if it was a single person that missed the content or if all operators were missing the main points. The totals across the bottom illustrate that discussing &amp;ldquo;How long will this change take?&amp;rdquo; had the lowest score. It was not clearly communicated and needs to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every round of the blitz has to have a judgment call regarding the need for a partial or whole message to be repeated. In this case, repeating the details around &amp;ldquo;How long will this change take?&amp;rdquo; is necessary, but the rest of the message in round two can be new content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to avoid a common mistake with organizational communications &amp;mdash; measuring the success of a communication from the sender&amp;rsquo;s point of view. Leaders frequently feel that &amp;ldquo;we told them&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;we have communicated this with a town-hall meeting, sent e-mails and put out posters regarding this message, they must know what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&amp;rdquo; In fact, they are assuming the employees got the message because of their high confidence in the development of the message and channels selected to deliver it. There are always opportunities to improve the effective delivery of a message, yet the only way to avoid assumptions of retention is to monitor retention with the receiver. See Illustration 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/8/24/0188dd05-c395-422b-b8b3-ec5a90d49667_illustration 3a.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 648px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The effectiveness of a communication should always be monitored by conducting face-to-face evaluations with the hourly employees, seeking to understand how much can be recalled. This has multiple positive effects. Site leaders are seen out in the work areas, leaders are following up on the message illustrating the importance, employees feel valued when they are asked these questions by top leadership, supervisors feel valued by having direct face-to-face time with the top leaders and the top leaders end up learning things about the employees and supervisors from their time together.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The cost to perform a communication blitz is the leadership&amp;rsquo;s time. It is much more efficient to send an e-mail and expect the employees to get the message. The most efficient approach is also typically the least effective. The investment in time is well worth the return. How many times has a big change been rolled out with minimal training and poor communication? When only the efficient methods are used, the results are usually meager at best.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Another important concept is that the communication blitz is intended to be a series of messages, not just one round. When the leaders are out checking the retention of the second and third messages, different employees should be approached. For each round that this is performed, a new message and subsequent questions need to be developed.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Including the top site leader during retention checks sends a significant message about the importance of the project at hand. When the hourly employees are approached by the top manager and the project manager, they get a clear message about the importance of the change and how they need to make sure to engage any information coming out about this project going forward.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Patricia Landry was leading the manufacturing excellence implementation at the Noranda Alumina processing plant in Gramercy, La., over the last couple years. Here&amp;rsquo;s how she reflects on her experience using the communication blitz approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How important is it to focus on clear, concise communications during a big project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is the No. 1 aspect that a management team must do to implement a change. Depending on the change, once employees understand the nature and the reasons behind the change, they typically will be more accepting of the project/change.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How would you rank the ability of the leadership team to communicate with employees before this approach was used? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The management team here at Noranda Alumina would be the first to admit that communication is not our strong suit. The communication blitz offered us an organized way of communicating to our 400(+) employees.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What was it like developing the first communication blitz?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Developing our first blitz taught us to focus on our audience. We understood the specifics of the project and did not need to communicate that in detail. We needed to let them know the basics and how it was going to affect them. We learned to keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How long did it take to roll out the message to all employees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The blitz was designed to take a month to communicate to everyone that we needed to reach. It actually took us a couple of weeks longer.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;How did you get the leadership team to divide up and go out to speak with the supervisors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We split the plant into segments, and each person volunteered for the areas that they wanted to be responsible for.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Did supervisors embrace or resist the communication effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	They embraced it.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Did hourly employees embrace or resist the communication effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t describe their reaction as embrace or resist but more of a &amp;ldquo;wait and see&amp;rdquo; attitude. It sounds good, but they are skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What kind of feedback did you get during the message-evaluation step?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It was positive. Most people had to be prompted. Once they were reminded of what manufacturing excellence was, they remembered the communication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What did you learn from the whole process of developing, rolling out and auditing the effectiveness of the first communication blitz? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	We learned that we have to remember our audience. The follow-up is also very important. What employees understand and what you intend to communicate can be two different things.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do you foresee this blitz approach playing a role in your communications going forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Yes, the manufacturing excellence steering team intends to continue communicating using the blitz method. It was even suggested as a communication tool corporate-wide at a leadership conference in September last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improving communications within an organization is not as difficult as many leaders may believe. Adopting the communication blitz process can bolster your change management strategies and improve both employee engagement and the sustainability of the changes at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>3 Effective Ways to Manage for Change</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On May 11, 1996, 34 people attempted to summit Mount Everest. In what came to be the deadliest single day on Mount Everest, eight people lost their lives. Numerous factors led to the tragedy &amp;ndash; most notably a late-day storm that trapped many on the peak. One of the climbers, a journalist by the name of Jon Krakauer, captured his experience that day in his book &amp;ldquo;Into Thin Air&amp;rdquo; and in it identified another more subtle, but just as significant factor in the tragedy. Krakauer was one of the first climbers to reach the summit on that day, and during the descent he became increasingly concerned about the other climbers&amp;rsquo; singular focus on reaching the summit. The basis for his concern was his knowledge that reaching the summit was only half the challenge. The descent from the peak is as difficult and exhausting as the ascent. By focusing so much effort on reaching the summit, the climbers risked not reserving both time and energy to make the demanding descent. When the storm hit, any remaining margin of safety was eliminated, and eight climbers never made it off the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, our challenges are rarely this extreme or the consequences this severe. In the challenges we do face, the fundamental lesson of the risks of focusing on only half of the journey applies. When planning for a change, the temptation is to focus on the technical solution and investing the majority of our time, energy and resources on developing the most technically correct solution &amp;ndash; i.e., the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; answer. Designing the solution, however, is only half of the challenge. The other half is execution &amp;ndash; getting people to embrace the strategy, implement the processes and use the technology. Without planning for the people side of the change, we risk leaving our team stranded on the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is a common occurrence in organizational changes to underestimate the effort required to get people to let go of the current ways and embrace new ones. To borrow from &amp;ldquo;Field of Dreams,&amp;rdquo; we like to believe &amp;ldquo;If we build it, they will come,&amp;rdquo; when reality is closer to &amp;ldquo;If you build it, they will admire it from afar.&amp;rdquo; As leaders and managers in our organizations, it is important that in addition to the technical side of the change, we also plan effectively for the people changes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Resistance to Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;You can expect resistance to change approximately 100 percent of the time. Change is difficult, and there are a number of physiological and psychological reasons for this. In fact, resistance to change is not in itself a problem. It means that people are facing the reality of making the changes. Our job is to be prepared to manage the resistance and assist our people in making the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Communicate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Research has shown that people process change in stages and have selective hearing as change is introduced. This means that no matter how hard you work on creating the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; communication, only part of the message will be heard. To really understand the entire message, people must hear it multiple times &amp;ndash; five to seven times is considered optimal. Note this does not mean write an email and hit send six times. Be creative and mix it up a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Listen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During change, no news is not good news. No news means that good information is not being discovered. Actively plan to &amp;ldquo;go see&amp;rdquo; how the change is progressing and talk to the people who are making the changes. Asking open-ended questions such as, &amp;ldquo;How do you see the changes helping you?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What are the major obstacles you see?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What are the risks of not changing?&amp;rdquo; will provide you with valuable insight into avoidable or removable barriers to the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past 20 years, transformational change efforts have a notoriously low success rate with most surveys and studies showing up to 70 percent of change efforts failing to meet objectives. Most of these failures can be directly linked to ineffective management of the people issues related to change. When managing for change, expect and plan for resistance, communicate more than seems necessary and actively listen to those who are making the change. Your success depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How Do You Create a High-Performance Team?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	An effective work team is a group of engaged individuals. In &amp;ldquo;The Toyota Way,&amp;rdquo; Jeffrey Liker tells us, &amp;ldquo;The center of TPS (Toyota Production System) is people. A common phrase heard around Toyota is &amp;#39;Before we build cars, we build people.&amp;#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can have the best tools, most productive processes and the biggest bank account, but none of this will produce results unless you have people. The research has been done, and the results are clear. People engaged in a common goal will trump advantages in resources, processes and capital. Just read the business best-sellers or search &amp;ldquo;employee engagement&amp;rdquo; if you need to see the business case for developing engaged employees. If you are reading this article, I assume you&amp;rsquo;re already convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A work group consists of individual people. To achieve high-performing teams, you must treat them as individual people. Individuals are engaged when they feel like their effort and opinions are valued and they are rewarded for their individual contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An individual&amp;rsquo;s manager is the most influential factor in the level of that individual&amp;rsquo;s engagement. Leaders of engaged work teams create shared goals, align goals with individual skills and aspirations, establish fair measures, delegate responsibility and authority, and reward individual contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Environment and market drive many of the specific leadership tasks required to sustain a high-performance team. The level of communication, feedback, authority and recognition are situational. Consider these ideas in the context of your situation and apply those that best fit your unique environment and work team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shared Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Create a direct line of sight between individual behavior, team goals, departmental goals and company goals. Consider using impact maps to document the connections. Publish these goals, talk about them and review them often. Twice a year is not nearly enough. In some cases, review them weekly, monthly or quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Individuals &amp;mdash; not teams or organizations &amp;mdash; change, learn and produce results. Focus attention on short-term results that contribute to overall goals like reducing costs, generating revenue and increasing customer value. Focus on a few goals you can achieve quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meet often and engage everyone in the discussions that impact shared goals. Encourage constructive team conflict. Allow it to be worked through. Do not cut it off or step in unless it becomes personal or voices are being stifled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Aligned Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assess individual strengths and aspirations, and then match goals and tasks to them. Design goals that build on an individual&amp;rsquo;s strengths and mitigate his weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work together to establish goals that advance the organization&amp;rsquo;s goals and personal aspirations. Do not assume you know what each individual&amp;rsquo;s aspirations are, or that they will remain constant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Review goals often, perhaps weekly, especially if you are in a fast-changing market environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do not make decisions that impact an individual&amp;rsquo;s ability to achieve his personal goals without his participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Fair Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Establish measures that the individual can impact. If you hold the individual accountable for a group or organiation goal, give that individual some responsibility and authority to achieve that goal. Do not tell someone he is responsible for group production and then deny him any voice in how (the actions and investments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To sustain engagement, individuals need to be able to impact the results.Talk with them about how. Guide a conversation about how they can impact their performance measures. Always have one to three documented goals that can be achieved in the short term that impact the measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hold people accountable for results. Give them the resources. Don&amp;rsquo;t tell them how. Tell them what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If someone is failing, then ask questions. In &amp;ldquo;The Toyota Way,&amp;rdquo; Liker writes, &amp;ldquo;Toyota leaders seldom give orders. In fact, the leaders often lead and mentor through questioning.&amp;rdquo; Stop giving orders and start asking questions, guiding people to the right choices through a process of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do not engage in skip level delegation. Work as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Individuals want to be recognized for their individual contribution and their group achievements. This includes financial and nonfinancial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Communication is one of the most underutilized forms of recognition. Use clear, concise communication. Repeat recognition often. Open every meeting with it. Recognize all individual contributors. Publish a weekly review of individual achievements and goals, either in print or meetings, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Pay the performers. When people exceed their individual goals in spite of their larger group shortcomings, be careful. If you want to keep top performers engaged, or on the payroll for that matter, pay for the individual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	High-performance teams are teams that pull toward a shared goal, help develop individual goals that inspire them, are measured in a few simple meaningful ways, are given the individual authority to impact those measures and are rewarded for their individual and team results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deploy the tactics that work for your situation. Don&amp;rsquo;t be paralyzed by the overwhelming options. Pick two &amp;mdash; one you can implement quickly and one that will have big impact. This can be achieved by starting each day thinking about how to build your people.Try something simple and just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Average weekly earnings of U.S. workers was $752 in fourth quarter</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Median weekly earnings of the nation&amp;#39;s 100.1 million full-time wage and salary workers were $752 in the fourth quarter of 2010 (not seasonally adjusted), the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on January 20. This was 0.5 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with a gain of 1.3 percent in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data on usual weekly earnings are collected as part of the Current Population Survey, a nationwide sample survey of households in which respondents are asked, among other things, how much each wage and salary worker usually earns. Data shown in this release are not seasonally adjusted unless otherwise specified. Highlights from fourth-quarter data are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Seasonally adjusted median weekly earnings were $751 in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 0.8 percent from the previous quarter, $745.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		On a not seasonally adjusted basis, median weekly earnings were $752 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Women who usually worked full time had median weekly earnings of $679, or 81.8 percent of the $830 median for men.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The female-to-male earnings ratio varied by race and ethnicity. White women earned 81.1 percent of their male counterparts, compared with black (96.2 percent), Asian (75.9 percent), and Hispanic women (89.9 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Among the major race and ethnicity groups, median weekly earnings for black men working at full-time jobs were $629 per week or 73.4 percent of the median for white men ($857). The difference was less among women, as black women&amp;#39;s median earnings ($605) were 87.1 percent of those for white women ($695). Overall, median earnings of Hispanics who worked full time ($539) were lower than those of blacks ($614), whites ($772), and Asians ($828).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Usual weekly earnings of full-time workers varied by age. Among men, those age 55 to 64 had the highest median weekly earnings, $1,003. Usual weekly earnings were highest for women age 35 to 44 and age 55 to 64, $737 and $742, respectively. Among all full-time workers, usual weekly earnings were lowest for those age 16 to 24 ($443).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Among the major occupational groups, persons employed full time in management, professional, and related occupations had the highest median weekly earnings &amp;ndash; $1,267 for men and $937 for women. Men and women employed in service jobs earned the least, $585 and $421, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		By educational attainment, full-time workers age 25 and over without a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $438, compared with $633 for high school graduates (no college) and $1,139 for those holding at least a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree. Among college graduates with advanced degrees (professional or master&amp;#39;s degree and above), the highest earning 10 percent of male workers made $3,383 or more per week, compared with $2,216 or more for their female counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Chart: Real earnings fall 0.4 percent in December</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for all employees fell 0.4 percent from November to December 2010, seasonally adjusted. This decrease stems from a 0.5 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which offset a 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Over-the-month change in real average hourly earnings for all employees, seasonally adjusted, December 2009âDecember 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2011/ted_20110120.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110120_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From November to December 2010, real average weekly earnings fell 0.4 percent, as the average work week remained unchanged and combined with the decline in real average hourly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From December 2009 to December 2010, real average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted. A 1.5-percent increase in average weekly hours, combined with the increase in real average hourly earnings, resulted in a 1.9-percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>U.S. companies say offshoring has not cost domestic jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The sixth annual study on corporations&amp;rsquo; offshoring trends was released by the Center for International Business Education and Research&amp;rsquo;s (CIBER) Offshoring Research Network (ORN) at Duke University&amp;rsquo;s Fuqua School of Business and The Conference Board. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study is part of ongoing research into the effects of offshoring trends on American competitiveness and reflects the sentiments of business managers as regional economies around the world continue to recover from the global recession and economic upheaval in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over half of the participants in our survey say offshoring has resulted in no change in the number of domestic jobs in most functions,&amp;rdquo; said Arie Lewin, Fuqua Professor of Strategy and International Business. &amp;ldquo;The finding that the U.S. software sector has the highest ratio of offshore to domestic employees &amp;ndash; almost 13 offshored jobs per 100 domestic jobs &amp;ndash; may be a reflection of a scarcity of domestic science and engineering graduates in the U.S.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, survey respondents are broadening the range of factors that influence their selection of an offshore location to include the location of the best service provider and the quality of infrastructure, e.g., telecommunications, power and transportation. In spite of placing a high priority on cost savings and labor arbitrage, the survey finds average achieved cost savings offshore have declined for functions at many companies. For example, IT services and software development have experienced consistent declines over the past five years while average achieved savings have increased for administrative and innovative functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the researchers, survey participants have lower expectations than previous respondents for average cost savings in several offshoring functions. Contact center, information technology and software development offshoring have seen the largest declines among all offshoring functions as companies new to offshoring discover a number of hidden costs involved, including expenses for training, staff recruitment and retention, and government and vendor relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The potential for cost reduction alone is no longer reason enough to move operations,&amp;rdquo; said Ton Heijmen, senior advisor to The Conference Board. &amp;ldquo;One survey respondent noted it has taken his company several years to discover that the impact of labor arbitrage disappears in fewer than three years. Companies are now shifting from cost-driven offshoring implementations to a multidimensional value proposition in creating a global footprint.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As companies expand offshoring activities by increasing scale or by offshoring more diverse and complex functions, most firms see a decline in the overall efficiency of their offshoring processes as measured by average cost savings across offshored functions. This may be partially attributed to a loss of managerial control as offshoring operations are expanded, requiring companies to improve coordination and management of their global sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Duke CIBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Duke&amp;rsquo;s Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) was established in 1992 by The Fuqua School of Business and has been directed by Professor Arie Y. Lewin since 1995. The Offshoring Research Network (ORN) was conceived as a multi-year initiative focused on understanding the relationship between offshoring and American competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are 33 CIBERs located throughout the U.S. that are funded by the U.S. Department of Education under Title VI through a competitive bid process. Duke CIBER collaborates with other CIBERs to carry out projects, and engages in outreach activities with other centers and departments at Duke as well as other colleges and universities, businesses and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Best practices for strategic talent management in manufacturing organizations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Increasingly CEOs, boards and other executives are asking human resources leaders to help achieve corporate goals by addressing a number of talent management challenges.&amp;nbsp;Within the manufacturing sector, many organizations have implemented programs such as the ISO 9001 quality management system in an effort to drive profitability and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ISO standards require organizations to be able to identify skill sets and competencies for each job in order to maintain certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to ISO 9001 expert, Lorri Hunt&lt;a href="https://noria.com/PublishingContentAdmin/Reliable%20Plant/Entries/Create?type=WebArticle#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Meeting these requirements can be complex for organizations as HR is often disconnected from the quality management process, and likely has a number of siloed systems in place, such as Learning Management Systems, which simply track information on employee&amp;rsquo;s training. To fully comply with 2008 Clause 6.2.2, organizations need to ensure that HR has the integrated systems and tools in place to evaluate employee performance and competencies on an ongoing basis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a solid talent management strategy, it can be difficult for HR teams to map required competencies for each position, and to link skill gaps with required training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing Effective Talent Management Strategies and Systems &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A strategy that puts employee performance appraisals at the centre of talent management enables manufacturing organizations to measure key areas such as product quality, demonstrate certifications are up to date, and prove that employees are competent and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This performance-centric approach also enables manufacturing organizations to create a logical workflow and process map that supports ISO, and can subsequently be used to support lean or Six Sigma initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To effectively meet ISO HR requirements and prepare for audits manufacturing organizations can use a Web-based talent management system to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Automate inefficient or manual processes for the documentation of qualifications such as training, licensing, certifications, competencies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Centralize the storage of an employee&amp;rsquo;s credentials, training and competencies for easy access during audits &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Enable HR to focus on executing the talent management strategy, while giving managers resources required to properly manage and coach employees&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Track employee performance year-round and better demonstrate a clear link between their performance and organizational performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an automated system that provides development history reports and training effectiveness metrics, manufacturers can also centralize all the documentation needed to demonstrate to ISO auditors that they are meeting HR and training program requirements.&amp;nbsp;For organizations focused on lean, the elimination of time consuming and expensive manual processes for HR and the organization as a whole, is particularly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementing the Right Talent Management System &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are some best practices for selecting, justifying and implementing an automated talent management system for a manufacturing organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish organization-specific business needs and expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate products and vendors to find the best match and use an evaluation checklist to identify must-have items.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Estimate the costs, savings and ROI over the next three to five years including training, hosting, maintenance, support costs, as well as soft benefits of automating talent management tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Justify the purchase with a business case/presentation to leadership outlining business needs, requirements, options available, benefits and ROI.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Secure organization-wide buy-in for the system to ensure success by involving stakeholders from IT, managers, executives and other key groups.&amp;nbsp; Consider a communications plan to ease the transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Talent management has a critical role to play in manufacturing organizations, particularly those who have implemented quality management systems including ISO.&amp;nbsp; The inclusion of a talent management strategy along with the appropriate technology enables organization to create and automate the workflow around their process map, ensure all employees have the skills and competencies in place, and document compliance with quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	When selecting a talent management solution, an evaluation checklist helps to clearly identify &amp;ldquo;must-have&amp;rdquo; items. For manufacturing organizations, several key requirements as they a related to Clause 6.2.2 include being able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify competence requirements for every employee in the organization, or at least those that affect product quality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Adapt the system to capture all of the components of competency (eg. education, skills, training and experience) and can support the method an organizations uses to determine competency requirements for a specific employee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify individual competence and skill gaps, and assign targeted actions, and create development plans as part of the evaluation process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Initiate a competency assessment outside of the scheduled performance appraisal process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of actions taken to improve competence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Women less interested in jobs where competition determines pay</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Men are more likely than women to seek jobs in which competition with co-workers affects pay rates, a preference that might help explain persistent pay differences between men and women, a study at the University of Chicago shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study, which covered most of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest metropolitan areas, also revealed regional variation in how much women desire jobs in which competition plays a role in determining wages. In cities where local wages are generally lower, women tend to want jobs in which competition determines wages, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We know that women, often working at the same kind of job as men, frequently are not paid as much as men,&amp;rdquo; said John List, professor of economics at UChicago and an author of the paper, &amp;ldquo;Do Competitive Work Places Deter Female Workers? A Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment on Gender Differences in Job-Entry Decisions,&amp;rdquo; published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Some of the explanations for the differences contend they are caused by discrimination or by women leaving the workforce to have children and then returning,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Other people have suggested that men are more attracted to competition than women, and that accounts for the differences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To test whether differences between men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s interest in competition actually affects their job choices, List and a research team created two advertisements on Internet job boards. They posted jobs for administrative assistants, the most common job in the United States. One ad, which was gender-neutral, described the job responsibilities as preparing reports based on news stories and fulfilling typical office tasks. The second ad, for a sports news assistant, was similar, except that the job would entail writing reports about sports stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advertisements were placed on job boards in 16 of the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest cities between January and April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team then presented respondents with additional information to describe different forms of compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some applicants were told the job paid $15 an hour. Others were told the pay was based on individual competition, with a base salary of $13.50, and a $3 bonus depending on how he or she did in comparison to other workers. Another package offered a $12 hourly base pay with a $6 bonus if the employee outperformed other workers. Still others were told the job had a competition-based wage, but that comparisons would be based on the productivity of people working in teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the 6,779 people who responded to the ads, 2,702 applied once they knew the wage structure. Those included 1,566 women and 1,136 men. (About 20 of the applicants were actually hired.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When the salary potential was most dependent on competition, men were 94 percent more likely to apply than women,&amp;rdquo; List said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study found that although women were much less likely to pursue jobs where individual competition was a factor, the deterring effect on women could be overcome by having workers compete in teams, rather than individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Women were more deterred by jobs in which competition was a factor in determining pay if the local wages in their city were high. For instance, women were less inclined to pursue jobs with competitive wage situations in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Boston, where the median wages for other local administrative assistant jobs were about $13, close to the base pay for the jobs the researchers offered. In cities with lower local wages, the dissuasive effect on women of competition-based pay diminished. For example in Houston, where the local wage was $10, women actually showed slightly more interest in applying to jobs with a competitive pay structure than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	List said socialization of women and men may play a factor in the gender differences in the way men and women respond to pay incentives based on competition. Boys receive more encouragement growing up to be competitive, particularly in sports, while girls frequently are encouraged to be more cooperative, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Joining List on the study were Jeffrey Flory, a graduate student in economics at the University of Maryland, College Park; and Andreas Leibbrandt, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/4n-QbtKD46U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Average hourly earnings for U.S. workers fell 0.4% in December</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for all employees fell 0.4 percent from November to December, seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on January 14. A 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings was more than offset by a 0.5 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average weekly earnings fell 0.4 percent over the month, as the average workweek remained unchanged and combined with the decline in real average hourly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted, from December 2009 to December 2010. A 1.5 percent increase in average weekly hours, combined with the increase in real average hourly earnings, resulted in a 1.9 percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production and non-supervisory employees &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory employees fell 0.6 percent from November to December, seasonally adjusted. A 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings was more than offset by a 0.6 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average weekly earnings fell 0.2 percent over the month, as a result of a 0.3 percent increase in the average workweek combined with the decrease in real average hourly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent, seasonally adjusted, from December 2009 to December 2010. The increase in real average hourly earnings combined with a 1.2 percent increase in the average workweek, resulted in a 1.5 percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/RhJaZO5KbDI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Oregon lost fewer manufacturing jobs over past 12 months</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Oregon fell 3.2 percent over the past 12 months according to the 2011 Oregon Manufacturers Directory, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. MNI reports Oregon lost 7,530 industrial jobs and 114 manufacturers between October 2009 and October 2010, less than half the loss reported by MNI over the 2008-2009 survey period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News reports Oregon is now home to 5,861 manufacturers employing 215,044 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Oregon&amp;#39;s industrial sectors continue to be battered by the housing bust and the recession,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of the Evanston, Ill.-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912. &amp;quot;However, we&amp;#39;re definitely seeing fewer job losses than we did a year ago and new manufacturing facilities continue to emerge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for Oregon included Intel&amp;#39;s plans to expand its Hillsboro facility; the opening of a LaCrosse Footwear manufacturing plant in Portland; the expansion of Finnish wind gear manufacturer Moventas at its Portland factory; the opening of Indow Windows, a manufacturer of energy-efficient window inserts, in North Portland; and the expansion of Solaicx&amp;#39;s North Portland solar panel plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies closing down over the year included International Paper in Albany, Suntron Corporation in Newberg, Oberto Sausage Company in Albany and Benchmark Electronics in Beaverton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports lumber and wood remains Oregon&amp;#39;s largest industrial sector by employment with 30,912 jobs, down 9.4 percent over the year, after layoffs at Weyerhaeuser&amp;#39;s engineered wood products site in Albany and at Roseburg Forest Products, among others. Second-ranked electronics manufacturing accounts for 28,566 jobs, down 1.6 percent over the past 12 months, while third-ranked food products manufacturing accounts for 28,520 industrial jobs, with no significant change reported over the year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial sectors that lost jobs over the year included printing/publishing, down 6.6 percent; transportation equipment, down 6 percent; furniture/fixtures, down 5.4 percent; stone/clay/glass, down 3.4 percent; rubber/plastics, down 1.7 percent; paper products, down 1.3 percent; and chemicals/allied products, down 1.1 percent. Sectors that gained jobs included fabricated metals, up 3.6 percent; primary metals, up 3.2 percent; and textiles/apparel, up 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News reports Northwest Oregon accounts for the most industrial employment in the state with 157,319 jobs, down 2.1 percent over the year. Southwest Oregon accounts for 43,616 jobs, down 6.6 percent, while Southeast Oregon is home to 8,230 industrial workers, also down 6.6 percent. Northeast Oregon accounts for 5,879 industrial jobs, down 4.8 percent. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Portland is Oregon&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment, home to 46,787 jobs, down just 1 percent over the year. Second-ranked Hillsboro accounts for 22,909 jobs, with employment up 1.4 percent. Industrial employment in Beaverton fell 2.7 percent and is currently home to 15,494 industrial workers. Eugene accounts for 12,652 industrial jobs, down 2.7 percent, while Salem accounts for 7,379 jobs, down 3.7 percent over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/17vuUiO6suk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The role of the UAW in the 21st century</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;The following is the speech given by United Auto Workers president Bob King to the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on January 12, 2011:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Today there is great cause for thanks and celebration.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		I am very blessed and very grateful to be here with you as the recently elected president of the UAW.&lt;br /&gt;
		I am grateful to President Obama for facing up to a great amount of pressure and negative public opinion and deciding that he was going to bet on American companies and American workers even when so many others were unwilling to do so and were more than happy to have our U.S. companies liquidate and have our jobs shipped outside of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		President Obama made the right bet and all of us and really the whole United States won! Easily over a million jobs were saved. And now with the financial turnaround of these companies, tens and tens of billions of dollars are being invested in the United States of America, tens and tens of thousands of good paying, community supporting jobs are being created and maintained, and work long outsourced from the USA is coming back to the USA!&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		And I want to express my appreciation to General Motors and Dan Ackerson, to Chrysler Fiat and Sergio Marchionne, and to Ford Motor Co., and to Bill Ford and Alan Mulally. All of these strong leaders are committed to rebuilding the American manufacturing base and therefore the American middle class and they are doing it with major new investments and great new products in our American automotive facilities.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		In Michigan alone as an example (for we have done this in many states), with great cooperation from government, business, and labor, $6.5 billion dollars in new investments in our auto facilities have been announced creating and maintaining 10,000 direct auto jobs &amp;mdash; and at least 60,000 &amp;ldquo;ripple&amp;rdquo; jobs! Thank you Ford, Chrysler and GM and thank you former Governor Granholm for your great leadership in making this happen and welcome to new Governor Snyder who we are committed to work with to create more jobs and investment in Michigan.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		I also want to thank the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate for their support, and especially our Michigan delegation and the House and Senate leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for standing up for U.S. companies and U.S. workers!&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		I am also very proud that in a time when there is increasing polarization in the United States we have been able to demonstrate a level of cooperation and creative problem solving that is so greatly needed in our country. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the American public wants ideologies, I believe they want results! Business, labor and the government working together have achieved amazing results that few thought was possible in such a short period of time. All of us cooperated and ALL of us focused on our common goals instead of our differences. Because of our joint efforts America is stronger today, many communities are much better off, and a million families are much better off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="body_copy" sizcache="0" sizset="9"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;What is the Role of the UAW in a Global Economy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Fundamental changes in the global economy demand fundamental change in the labor movement. The UAW of the 21st century remains dedicated to the core mission of the labor movement &amp;ndash; to create, support and sustain a strong middle class with dignity and respect for every person who works hard and plays by the rules. History clearly demonstrates that democracy cannot survive without a strong middle class, and a strong middle class is built and maintained through the institution of collective bargaining and strong unions. We understand that globalization has radically altered the competitive environment facing the auto sector. Indeed, we have paid the price for failing to learn this lesson quickly enough. The UAW has learned from the past and has embraced dramatic and radical change.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		To achieve our mission in this new environment, the UAW of the 21st century has a dual responsibility. One responsibility is to partner with our UAW employers to create growth, strength, competitiveness, and profitability. Our other responsibility is to advocate for a Fair Deal for all workers. A Fair Deal means fair middle class sustaining wages, benefits and pensions. A Fair Deal means a regular employee status vs. temporary status. A Fair Deal means retirement with dignity. A Fair Deal means sharing in the good times as well as sacrificing in the bad times. A Fair Deal means safe neighborhoods and good schools for our kids through fair taxes on good wages and profits. And we know that without the financial success of our employers, there is no economic foundation for a middle class and a Fair Deal. We also know that without a real, enforceable right to organize and collective bargaining, unfettered corporate power will undermine responsible companies and destroy the middle class and any chance for a Fair Deal for all Americans.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		The success of the collaboration between the UAW and the unionized automakers demonstrates beyond any doubt the authenticity and intensity of the union&amp;rsquo;s commitment to our corporate partners. We have shown that cooperation, creative problem solving, mutual respect and common goals can produce extraordinary victories.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		Success in a global economy requires innovation. The UAW and our membership celebrate innovation and creativity.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		Success in a global economy requires flexibility. The UAW and our membership embrace flexibility and openness.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		Success in a global economy requires producing the highest quality products. The UAW and our membership make quality our top priority and we champion the needs of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The results are in on the UAW&amp;rsquo;s positive impact working with our UAW-represented employers:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			We are making the highest quality vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			We have the most productive plants.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			We have best-in-industry attendance by our members.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			We have extremely high commitment and dedication by UAW members on the shop floor to maintaining the highest quality, the highest productivity and delivering the best product at the best value to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Working with the UAW is a smart business decision. Every day in every way, the UAW is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to help our employers through innovation, flexibility, continuous cost-saving, quality, and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		With our unionized employers, we have created a culture of trust, teamwork and openness. We have completely discarded the outdated remnants of the &amp;ldquo;us versus them&amp;rdquo; mentality that resulted in rigid work rules and narrow job classifications. We have dramatically reduced classifications -- many facilities only have one main production classification. Our members like and embrace the challenge and the flexibility. An observer coming into many of our plants and talking to an employee can&amp;#39;t tell which worker belongs to management and which worker is a member of the union because we are all focused on producing the highest quality and best value for customers.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		This is all indicative of the UAW&amp;rsquo;s commitment to taking the high road in all of our dealings with the corporate community. Our mindset is not adversarial. We do not seek conflict. Our agenda is a positive one of shared responsibility and shared prosperity. We do not believe the United States can successfully compete in the global economy if we are divided and polarized.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		Our positive and constructive approach and outlook extends to our attitude towards the foreign-owned non-union automakers. We take note of the fact that all of the German, Japanese and Korean automakers have a long history of recognizing and working with unions in their home countries. These relationships show that the transnational companies operating in the United States accept the fundamental right of workers to organize. We want to restart our relationship with these companies by presenting them with an ethical framework that states that American workers have the same right to form unions as the workers in their home countries. &lt;strong&gt;American workers, after all, are NOT second-class global citizens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We call this ethical framework the UAW Principles for Fair Union Elections. This document embodies common sense principles inherent in any democratic election. The underlying principle is that the right to organize a union is a fundamental human right. Workers cannot exercise this right in an atmosphere of fear. Therefore, there must be no threats, intimidation or coercion -- explicit or implicit -- in order to gain votes. Employees have the right to hear equally from both sides. If management gives a 10-minute speech, then the union can give a 10-minute speech. If management posts a notice, the union can post a notice in the same location. Neither party should demonize or disparage the other or engage in untruths. If employees vote to unionize, the parties should promptly bargain for a fair, responsible agreement that keeps the employer competitive. The UAW commits to being a strong partner in making the company competitive and successful.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We have reached out to the non-union auto companies in a spirit of respect to ask that they agree to these principles. We hope that they do, and if so, we look forward to engaging their employees in a free, democratic election process free of acrimony, tension, fear and discord. If employees make a free choice not to join the UAW, we will of course respect that decision, and hope that in the future we will make a better case for the importance of a union for all autoworkers. If the employees do vote to unionize, the UAW will add value and do everything within our power to make the company competitive and successful.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We will closely examine the responses of the non-union companies to this outreach. Actions speak louder than words. A company cannot truthfully say that it respects the right of its employees to organize and at the same time hold mandatory meetings condemning and misrepresenting the UAW. A company cannot truthfully say that is respects the right to organize and at the same time suggest that it would close a plant if employees vote to unionize. A company cannot truthfully claim to respect the right to organize and at the same time tell the employees that a unionized company cannot survive in a competitive environment or that the UAW would jeopardize their benefits. A company cannot truthfully claim to respect the right to organize and at the same time separate out, harass and pressure union supporters.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		Why do we propose these principles instead of using the NLRB election process? The National Labor Relations Board election procedures are outdated and ineffective. American labor law simply does not provide a fair framework for union elections. Companies can intimidate, threaten and coerce employees with impunity. There cannot be a fair vote when workers are afraid of losing their jobs. There cannot be a fair vote when workers can hear only one side. There cannot be a fair vote when union supporters are routinely harassed, disciplined, and in some cases even fired. There cannot be a fair vote when supervisors pressure workers one-on-one. There cannot be a fair vote when management can delay the process indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		There is nothing ethical or moral about the fear-mongering, intimidation and coercion that are a routine part of NLRB elections. Anyone familiar with how union election campaigns take place in this country knows that the single dominant factor in a worker&amp;rsquo;s decision is fear. The Labor Board election process is fatally, hopelessly flawed.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We intend to hold companies accountable to allow their employees to freely and democratically choose whether or not to join the UAW.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		There is no more pressing issue of social justice than the right of workers to organize unions. Freedom of association is a global human right. It is the First Amendment right of workers. Free and independent unions are an essential feature of a democracy. It is the sacred mission of the UAW to hold corporations accountable for respecting this right, both in the United States and around the world. Without the right to organize and bargain there will be no strong, sustainable middle class. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The right to organize and bargain collectively creates the important balance of power between workers and global corporations!&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		If a non-union automaker violates workers&amp;rsquo; democratic rights and rejects these principles, we will commit the entire resources of our union to expose this company&amp;rsquo;s anti-democratic behavior. We will not stand quietly by while a foreign corporation treats Americans as second class citizens. We will not stand quietly by while a corporation threatens workers for trying to organize a union. We will not stand quietly by in the face of a concerted assault on the middle class and on the institution of collective bargaining.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		If a company makes the business decision to engage in anti-union activity and suppress the rights of freedom of speech and assembly, we will launch a global campaign to brand that company as a human rights violator. We are joining with our sister unions in the U.S. and around the world, friends and allies in the U.S. and around the world, and together we will wage a united front to expose and publicize any auto company whose aim is the destruction of the right to organize and the institution of collective bargaining.&lt;br /&gt;
		We are establishing the UAW Global Organizing Institute whose mission is to recruit young people and other activists to demonstrate globally on behalf of Workers&amp;rsquo; Right to Organize Unions.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We do not want to fight with any company. We want to help companies produce the best cars for the best value. We do not want an adversarial relationship. We seek common ground and common goals. We do not want to spend all of our resources to defend the rights of workers to organize; we would rather spend our resources helping to fund innovation and training and collaborative projects.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We do not want to fight, but we will not run from a fight. The UAW will not rest until workers in the United States and globally are guaranteed their First Amendment right to organize and bargain collectively.&lt;br /&gt;
		Unions are vital to democracy. Unions are essential to social justice. Like any social institution, unions are not perfect. But unions are the sole vehicle throughout history by which working people have gained a voice on the job and a decent standard of living. Just as the UAW helped to build the American middle class, the UAW will now work to build a global middle class. The interests of American workers are inextricably linked to the aspirations and uplifting of the world&amp;rsquo;s poor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The best way to achieve global prosperity and as a result global peace is to support workers rights to organize and collectively bargain. We see this need dramatically in China, India, Bangladesh, Mexico, and many other parts of the world&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		In conclusion I want to emphasize what we see as the fundamental question of this moment in history. The question is not whether unions are perfect. We are not. The question is not whether management would prefer to operate without a union. No doubt, many managers would. The fundamental question is a question of freedom and democracy: whether societies will allow workers who want unions to form unions. The UAW will not rest until that freedom is secured for workers in America and throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		We are saying to global corporations that the best moral decision AND the best business decision is to work with the UAW and to respect workers democratic right to choose to form their local union or not to! If management and labor in the automotive industry work together we can create a strong global middle class just as the UAW and automotive companies created the U.S. middle class. I believe this is our calling, this is our opportunity: We will together build a better world by together building a global middle class.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Job openings by month since November 2008</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There were 3.2 million job openings on the last day of November. The job openings rate was essentially unchanged over the month at 2.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Job openings level, seasonally adjusted, November 2008âNovember 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2011/ted_20110112.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110112_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the most recent series trough in July 2009, the number of job openings has risen by 0.9 million, or 39 percent. This trough immediately followed the end of the recession in June 2009 (as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even with the gains since July 2009, the number of job openings in November remained 1.1 million below the 4.4 million openings when the recession began in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the BLS &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/jlt/"&gt;Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey&lt;/a&gt;, and are seasonally adjusted. More information can be found in &amp;quot;Job Openings and Labor Turnover &amp;mdash; November 2010&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_01112011.htm"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_01112011.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), news release USDL-11-0015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/b2Vabo9lBN4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Employers reveal outrageous, common mistakes candidates made in job interviews</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With competition for open positions remaining high, the added pressure and stress may be causing some job seekers to make unnecessary mistakes during their interviews that could cost them the job. A new nationwide CareerBuilder survey of more than 2,400 hiring managers conducted &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;November 15 to December 2, 2010&lt;/span&gt; reveals the outrageous and common mistakes that some candidates have made in job interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When asked what the most outrageous blunders they had encountered interviewing candidates were, hiring managers reported the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provided a detailed listing of how previous employer made them mad.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Hugged hiring manager at the end of the interview.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ate all the candy from the candy bowl while trying to answer questions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Constantly bad mouthed spouse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Blew her nose and lined up the used tissues on the table in front of her.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brought a copy of their college diploma that had obviously been white-outed and their name added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Wore a hat that said &amp;quot;take this job and shove it.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Talked about how an affair cost him a previous job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Threw his beer can in the outside trashcan before coming into the reception office.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Had a friend come in and ask &amp;quot;How much longer?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the most unusual gaffes, employers shared the most common mistakes candidates made during an interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Answering a cell phone or texting during the interview &amp;ndash; 71 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dressing inappropriately &amp;ndash; 69 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Appearing disinterested &amp;ndash; 69 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Appearing arrogant &amp;ndash; 66 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Speaking negatively about a current or previous employer &amp;ndash; 63 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Chewing gum &amp;ndash; 59 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Not providing specific answers &amp;ndash; 35 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Not asking good questions &amp;ndash; 32 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The good news is that the number of open jobs continues to improve month over month; however competition will remain high for some time to come,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Rosemary Haefner&lt;/span&gt;, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder. &amp;quot;The goal of any interview is to stand out from the other candidates and ultimately land the job, but make sure you stand out for the right reasons. Even though the job search process can be frustrating, candidates should stay positive, focus on their strengths and be prepared on how to best sell their skill set.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haefner offers the following tips for successful interviews in a competitive job market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Keep it upbeat:&lt;/b&gt; Many job seekers may be experiencing tougher than usual job searches in this economy. Even if your job search process has been frustrating, do what you can to remain positive and upbeat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Prepare, prepare, prepare:&lt;/b&gt; Before the interview, research the company by looking at the press room for recent announcements, the About Us section for company culture, and the list of products so you are familiar with their offerings. Having this knowledge will allow you to easily answer and ask questions during the interview. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Keep it professional, not personal:&lt;/b&gt; Don&amp;#39;t let business decorum disappear even in the interview is in a casual setting. Refrain from discussing over-the-top personal issues and focus on the position and selling yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Practice does make perfect: &lt;/b&gt;Nerves are likely to rear their head in an interview, so help calm them ahead of time by practicing. Go through common interview questions with a friend or family member and practice in front of mirror so you can see read your body language.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Honesty is the best policy: &lt;/b&gt;If questions come up that you don&amp;#39;t know how to answer, don&amp;#39;t lie or pretend you know. Admit that you may not know the answer, but then explain how you would go about finding a solution, proving your resourcefulness.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>U.S. job openings rate pretty much unchanged in latest report</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There were 3.2 million job openings on the last business day of November, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on January 11. The job openings rate was essentially unchanged over the month at 2.4 percent. Both the hires rate and the separations rate were little changed at 3.2 percent each in November. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires and separations for the total non-farm sector by industry and by geographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Openings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The number of job openings in November was 3.2 million, which was little changed from 3.3 million in October. Since the most recent series trough in July 2009, the number of job openings has risen by 0.9 million, or 39 percent. This trough immediately followed the end of the recession in June 2009 (as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research). Even with the gains since July 2009, the number of job openings in November remained 1.1 million below the 4.4 million openings when the recession began in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of job openings in November (not seasonally adjusted) increased from 12 months earlier for total non-farm and total private. The level was little changed over the year for government. Over the year, the job openings level increased in seven industries and was essentially unchanged in the remaining industries. The job openings level was up over the year in all four regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In November, the hires rate was little changed at 3.2 percent for total non-farm and was essentially unchanged for all industries and regions. There were 4.2 million hires during the month, 9 percent higher than the most recent series trough in June 2009. This trough coincided with the official end of the recession. Despite the gains since June 2009, the number of hires in November remained below the 5.0 million hires when the recession began in December 2007. Since their respective troughs, the hires level has risen at a slower pace than the job openings level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the 12 months ending in November, the hires rate (not seasonally adjusted) was unchanged for total non-farm, total private and government. The hires rate increased over the past 12 months in finance and insurance and was essentially unchanged in the remaining industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Separations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Total separations includes quits (voluntary separations), layoffs and discharges (involuntary separations), and other separations (including retirements). The total separations, or turnover, rate in November was essentially unchanged for total non-farm, total private and government. The total separations rate increased for state and local government. Over the 12 months ending in November, the total separations rate (not seasonally adjusted) was unchanged for total non-farm, total private and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quits rate can serve as a measure of workers&amp;rsquo; willingness or ability to change jobs. In November, the quits rate was unchanged for total non-farm (1.5 percent), total private (1.7 percent) and government (0.5 percent) and there was little or no change in every industry and region. The number of quits in November (2.0 million) is higher than the series trough in September 2009 (1.7 million), but it is still well below the series peak in November 2006 (3.2 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the 12 months ending in November, the quits rate (not seasonally adjusted) was essentially unchanged for all industries and regions. Quits levels increased over the year in mining and logging and in the Midwest region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The layoffs and discharges component of total separations is seasonally adjusted at the total non-farm, total private and government levels. The layoffs and discharges level was essentially unchanged in November for total non-farm and total private but increased for government. The number of layoffs and discharges for total non-farm peaked at 2.6 million in January 2009, then fell to 1.8 million in November 2010. In government, the number of layoffs and discharges in November (133,000) was higher than when the recession began in December 2007 (117,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was essentially unchanged over the 12 months ending in November for total non-farm, total private and government. The layoffs and discharges level declined over the year in transportation, warehousing and utilities; professional and business services; federal government; and in the South region. The other separations series is not seasonally adjusted. In November, there were 280,000 other separations for total non-farm, 244,000 for total private and 36,000 for government. Compared to November 2009,&amp;nbsp; the number of other separations was little changed for total non-farm, total private and government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/MD4-Z4xNp3I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>EEOC reports job bias charges hit record high in fiscal year 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on January 11 announced that private sector workplace discrimination charge filings with the federal agency nationwide hit an unprecedented level of 99,922 during fiscal year (FY) 2010, which ended September 30, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite the increase in overall charges filed with the EEOC last fiscal year, the commission dramatically slowed the growth of the charge inventory.&amp;nbsp;As a result, the federal agency ended FY 2010 with 86,338 pending charges &amp;ndash; an increase of only 570 charges, or less than 1 percent. Between fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the EEOC&amp;#39;s pending inventory increased 15.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We are pleased to see that our rebuilding efforts are having an impact on how efficiently and effectively the commission enforces the civil rights laws protecting the nation&amp;#39;s workers,&amp;quot; said EEOC chair Jacqueline A. Berrien. &amp;quot;Discrimination continues to be a substantial problem for too many job seekers and workers, and we must continue to build our capacity to enforce the laws that ensure that workplaces are free of unlawful bias.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The FY 2010 data show that the EEOC filed 250 lawsuits, resolved 285 lawsuits, and resolved 104,999 private sector charges. Through its combined enforcement, mediation and litigation programs, the EEOC secured more than $404 million in monetary benefits from employers &amp;ndash; the highest level of monetary relief ever obtained by the Commission through the administrative process &amp;ndash; to promote inclusive and discrimination-free workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The FY 2010 enforcement and litigation statistics, which include trend data, are available online at &lt;a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/index.cfm"&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the FY 2010 data, all major categories of charge filings in the private sector (which include charges filed against state and local governments) increased. These include charges alleging discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Equal Pay Act; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). Last year, for the first time ever, retaliation under all statutes (36,258) surpassed race (35,890) as the most frequently filed charge, while allegations based on religion (3,790), disability (25,165) and age (23,264) increased. In its first year of enforcement, the EEOC received 201 charges under GINA. Historically, race had been the most frequently filed charge since the EEOC became operational in 1965. &lt;a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm"&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	The FY 2010 data also show:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford to add 7,000 U.S. workers during next two years</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company on January 10 announced it will add 7,000 new hourly and salaried jobs between this year and next in the United States. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year alone, Ford is adding nearly 4,000 hourly jobs at several of its U.S. plants, including 1,800 at Louisville Assembly Plant, which is preparing to launch the next-generation Ford Escape late in the year. Ford also will add 750 salaried engineering jobs in product development and manufacturing. Next year, Ford expects to add at least 2,500 more new manufacturing positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ford is committed to American manufacturing, and we are on a path to add&amp;nbsp;more than 7,000 American workers over the next two years as we continue to grow our product lineup,&amp;quot; said Mark Fields, Ford president of The Americas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Working with our partners, including the UAW,&amp;nbsp;Ford is&amp;nbsp;finding competitive ways to engineer and build&amp;nbsp;even more high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles with technologies American consumers really want.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford is recruiting salaried engineers specializing in batteries, system controls, software and energy storage to work on electric vehicles in Detroit and eight other cities including Boston; Chicago; Cincinnati; Columbus, Ohio; Milwaukee; Raleigh and Durham, N.C.; and San Jose, Calif. This recruitment launches at the 2011 North American International Auto Show during industry preview days on January 12 and January 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/I802T1AMHr0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Conference Board Employment Trends Index up 7.6% vs. one year ago</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Conference Board Employment Trends Index (ETI) increased in December for the third consecutive month, closing the last quarter of 2010 on a positive note. The index now stands at 99.3, up from November&amp;#39;s revised figure of 98.5. The index is up 7.6 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Says Gad Levanon, associate director for macroeconomic research at The Conference Board: &amp;quot;The improvement in the Employment Trends Index in recent months suggests employment growth is likely to accelerate moderately in the first half of 2011. While this is a welcome improvement, we don&amp;#39;t expect employment to grow fast enough for the unemployment rate to dip below 9 percent for the rest of the year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This month&amp;#39;s increase in the ETI was driven by positive contributions from five out of the eight components. The improving indicators included Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance, Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now, Number of Temporary Employees, Industrial Production and Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market indicators, each of which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating individual indicators into a composite index filters out so-called &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; to show underlying trends more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The eight labor-market indicators aggregated into the Employment Trends Index include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find &amp;quot;Jobs Hard to Get&amp;quot; (The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now (National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons (BLS)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job Openings (BLS)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Chart: U.S. payroll employment in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Since December 2009, total payroll employment has increased by 1.1 million, or an average of 94,000 per month, according to the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Bureau of Labor Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Since December 2009, employment in education and health services has increased 422,000. Employment in professional and business services has increased 366,000, and since a recent low point in December 2009, leisure and hospitality has added nearly a quarter of a million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Unemployment rate falls to 9.4%; payroll employment increases by 103,000</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percentage point to 9.4 percent in December, and non-farm payroll employment increased by 103,000, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on January 7. Employment rose in leisure and hospitality and in health care but was little changed in other major industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Household Survey Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The number of unemployed persons decreased by 556,000 to 14.5 million in December, and the unemployment rate dropped to 9.4 percent. Over the year, these measures were down from 15.2 million and 9.9 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (9.4 percent) and whites (8.5 percent) declined in December. The unemployment rates for adult women (8.1 percent), teenagers (25.4 percent), blacks (15.8 percent) and Hispanics (13.0 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.2 percent, not seasonally adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs dropped by 548,000 to 8.9 million. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 6.4 million and accounted for 44.3 percent of the unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The civilian labor force participation rate edged down in December to 64.3 percent, and the employment-population ratio was essentially unchanged at 58.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was essentially unchanged in December at 8.9 million. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About 2.6 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in December, little different than a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the marginally attached, there were 1.3 million discouraged workers in December, an increase of 389,000 from December 2009. (The data is not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishment Survey Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Total non-farm payroll employment increased by 103,000 in December. Employment rose in leisure and hospitality and in health care but changed little in other major industries. Since December 2009, total payroll employment has increased by 1.1 million, or an average of 94,000 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 47,000 in December. Within the industry, job gains continued in food services and drinking places (+25,000). Since a recent low in December 2009, the food services industry has added 188,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, health care employment continued to expand, with a gain of 36,000. Over the month, job gains continued in ambulatory services (+21,000), hospitals (+8,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+7,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within professional and business services, employment in temporary help services continued to trend up in December (+16,000) and has risen by 495,000 since a recent low in September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in retail trade changed little in December (+12,000). A job gain in motor vehicle and parts dealers (+8,000) offset a loss in health and personal care stores (-8,000). Employment in most other service-providing industries changed little over the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the goods-producing sector, mining employment continued to trend up in December, reflecting a job gain in support activities for mining (+5,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing employment changed little over the month (+10,000). Following job growth earlier in 2010, employment has been relatively flat, on net, since May. Construction employment also was little changed overall in December (-16,000). Within construction, there were job losses in heavy and civil engineering (-13,000) and in residential building (-6,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The average workweek for all employees on private non-farm payrolls held at 34.3 hours in December. The manufacturing workweek for all employees declined by 0.1 hour to 40.2 hours, while factory overtime remained at 3.1 hours. The average workweek for production and non-supervisory employees on private non-farm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 33.6 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, average hourly earnings for all employees on private non-farm payrolls increased by 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $22.78. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.8 percent. In December, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and non-supervisory employees rose by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $19.21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The change in total non-farm payroll employment for October was revised from +172,000 to +210,000, and the change for November was revised from +39,000 to +71,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/MC6yr1mJaYM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Employee confidence in job security and company outlook increased in Q4</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Despite recent economic reports that show jobless claims down for several consecutive weeks, employees reveal mixed feelings about what is in store at their employer, for the overall job market and their pay check in the year ahead. According to the Q4 Glassdoor.com Employment Confidence Survey of 2,118 U.S. adults aged 18+ conducted on its behalf by Harris Interactive, employees are more confident in their job security and company&amp;#39;s outlook in the next six months than they were in the third quarter. However, this optimism is not universal as employees remain pessimistic about pay raises and have grown more uncertain about the job market since last quarter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This varied sentiment may be influenced by the types and frequency of employer-initiated actions and cuts that impact employees and their jobs. In the fourth quarter, 40 percent of employees reported their employers made changes to the number of staff, organizational structure, compensation and benefits, or other perks in the past six months, which is down from 55 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 when the majority of these job actions involved layoffs or layoff plans. In the past year, the highest incidence of employer actions shifted to compensation changes or cuts. This quarter, more than half (52 percent) of employees who reported at least some change indicated their company made changes to or reduced compensation in the past six months, up from 50 percent a year ago. One in four (27 percent) said their own compensation (pay, bonus, etc.) was reduced during the same period. However, layoff reports dropped 11 points year-over-year with 46 percent of employees reporting their employers initiated or communicated layoffs in the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While reported cutbacks in other areas declined or remained at the same level from the third quarter, health and dental benefit cuts peaked at the highest level in two years following steady quarterly increases. This quarter, 28 percent of employees who cited at least some changes reported cuts to their health and dental benefit in the past six months, compared to 22 percent in the third quarter and 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, employees reported fewer cuts in perks (i.e. commuter subsidies, free food, tuition reimbursement) (12 percent) and hiring freezes (24 percent) than in previously reported quarters. The rates for furloughs, unpaid leave and/or mandatory vacation (17 percent) as well as job restructurings/redundancies (11 percent) remained unchanged from the third quarter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Employees are getting mixed signals from their employers and the market, so it&amp;#39;s no surprise employee confidence in the fourth quarter reflects a mixed bag of optimism and caution,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Rusty Rueff&lt;/span&gt;, Glassdoor.com career and workplace expert, who has run global HR departments at Electronic Arts and PepsiCo before co-authoring &lt;i&gt;Talent Force: A New Manifesto for the Human Side of Business&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;quot;Employment confidence is very personal. While there are some recent positive indicators in the labor market, these don&amp;#39;t capture the wide range of employer cuts and other actions employees see and feel on a regular basis. Employee sentiment about their job, company and market will likely remain tempered until they see consistent and sustained periods of growth, fewer cutbacks at work and among their friends&amp;#39; companies, and more people getting hired into positions that were either eliminated or put on hold during the recession.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Glassdoor Employment Confidence Survey highlights four key indicators of employee confidence in the areas of salary and bonus expectations, job security, job market/re-hire probability and company outlook. The fourth quarter highlights are below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compensation: 45% of Employees Do Not Expect Raise; Majority of Those Bonus Eligible Expect 2010 Bonus; Men Significantly Outnumber Women on Bonus Eligibility and More Likely to Expect Bonus Increases &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Employees are less confident about getting a pay raise in the next 12 months than in the past two quarters. Nearly half (45 percent) of employees report they do &lt;u&gt;not &lt;/u&gt;expect a pay raise in the next 12 months while approximately one-third (36 percent) believe they will and 19 percent are unsure. Those who think they will receive a pay raise is down one percentage point from the third quarter and five points from the fourth quarter 2009. Those in the West are even less optimistic where more than half (55 percent) do &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; expect a pay raise in the next 12 months, up from 48 percent in the region in the third quarter, compared to those in the Northeast (44 percent), Midwest (42 percent) and South (43 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the annual supplemental year-end bonus question, 75 percent of employees reported being bonus eligible, which breaks down to 79 percent of men and 71 percent of women. Of those bonus eligible, the majority (58 percent) expect a bonus while one-third (37 percent) do not. By comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2008 shortly after the market crashed, 57 percent said they expected a bonus while 40 percent did not. Of those who currently expect a bonus, 21 percent expect it to be more than their last bonus, 47 percent expect it to be the same and 16 percent expect it to be less while another 16 percent are unsure. Of those bonus-eligible, more men (62 percent) than women (53 percent) expect a bonus; and, of those who expect a bonus, twice as many men (16 percent) than women (7 percent) expect an increase in this year&amp;#39;s bonus over their last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job Security: Layoff Concerns for Self, Co-workers Drop &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After edging up in the third quarter, employee concerns about layoffs dropped in the fourth quarter. Employees concerned that they could be laid off in the next six months decreased to 17 percent, down three points from the third quarter and the year-ago quarter (20 percent). Layoff concerns are highest among those 35-44 (21 percent) and more so among men in that age group (25 percent) compared to women (16 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee concern for coworker layoffs also dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, with 31 percent reporting concerns their coworkers could be laid off in the next six months, down from 33 percent in the prior quarter. This is a considerable decrease from the fourth quarters of 2009 (39 percent) and 2008 (42 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Job Market&lt;/span&gt;: Optimism Rises among Unemployed Job Seekers; Employees More Uncertain in Ability to Get Rehired &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For the first time in a year, slightly more unemployed job seekers think it is likely (31 percent) that they will land a job in the next six months than those who believe it is unlikely (27 percent) while one-third (34 percent) remain uncertain. However, despite recent positive job data, employed adults (including those self employed) reveal greater uncertainty in the job market in the fourth quarter than in the prior seven quarters. If they lost their job, one-third (33 percent) report they are uncertain whether they could find a job matched to their experience and compensation levels in the next six months, up from 28 percent last quarter. This sentiment is pretty evenly split among those who think it is likely (34 percent) and those who think it is unlikely (32 percent). Not surprisingly, optimism in the ability to land a new job in the next six months is highest among younger workers 18-34 (43 percent) compared to those 35-44 (36 percent), 44-54 (26 percent) and those 55+ (26 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Company Outlook: Greater Optimism -- 4 Point Increase in Expectation for Company to be &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the fourth quarter, 42 percent of employees (including those self-employed) reported they expect their company outlook to get better in the next six months, up from 38 percent in the third quarter. Only nine percent expect their company&amp;#39;s outlook to get worse in the next six months, down from 13 percent in the third quarter, and 10 percent in the year-ago quarter. Nearly half (48 percent) expect their company&amp;#39;s outlook to stay about the same. Twice as many employees in the West (15 percent) expect their company&amp;#39;s outlook to get worse in the next six months than those in the Northeast (7 percent) and South (7 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/yz7Z2CJN99g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>10 employment trends to watch in 2011</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With 2011 shaping up to be a better year for job growth, CareerBuilder surveyed more than 2,400 employers and 3,900 workers nationwide to identify 10 key trends in business, hiring, work culture and job search. The survey was conducted by Harris Interactive from November 15 to December 2, 2010 across industries and company sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The recession produced fundamental shifts in how companies and workers view the market,&amp;rdquo; said Brent Rasmussen, president of CareerBuilder North America. &amp;ldquo;Businesses are becoming more agile and changing direction. They&amp;rsquo;re operating leaner and recruiting for opportunities in emerging areas. Workers are transitioning to new fields, are more open to relocation and are more apt to consider opportunities outside of their current employers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;2) Working Leaner&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Thirty-five percent of employers reported that their current staffs are smaller than pre-recession levels. Of those employers, most anticipate no adjustments to staff levels in 2011, with 57 percent reporting that they have become accustomed to handling the workload with less headcount. Others pointed to their business changing focus and hiring in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;3) Changing Jobs&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Workers are becoming more optimistic about their job prospects in the New Year. Fifteen percent of full-time, employed workers are actively seeking a new job. Seventy-six percent reported that, although they are not actively looking, they would change jobs in 2011 for the right opportunity. Workers aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily focused on a bigger paycheck. Sixty-eight percent reported that affordable benefits are more important to them than salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;4) Creating New Functions&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Along with more traditional job opportunities, employers are also adding new functions within their organizations in response to popular movements. Jobs centered around social media, green energy and healthcare reform are being added in the New Year. Hiring managers also reported demand for &amp;ldquo;cyber warriors&amp;rdquo; to protect Internet sites from security breaches or fraudulent activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;5) Video Interviewing&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; With smaller recruiting staffs facing larger amounts of job applications, employers are turning to technology to help identify viable candidates. Six percent reported they have conducted video interviews with potential job candidates while 11 percent plan to do so in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;6) Less Moonlighting &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ndash; While making ends meet continues to be a challenge for many U.S. households, less workers are reporting the need to work more than one job. Twelve percent plan to take on second jobs in 2011, compared to 19 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;7) Taking a Global Perspective&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Nearly one-in-five U.S. employers (18 percent) reported they will be hiring for their operations in other countries in 2011. Five percent stated they will likely recruit workers from other countries to work in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;8) Relocating Talent&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Of workers who were laid off in the last 12 months and found new jobs, 23 percent relocated to a new city or state. Looking to the New Year, 33 percent of employers stated they would be willing to pick up the moving tab for select candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;9) Promoting Without Pay&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Forty-one percent of employers are concerned about losing their top talent as the economy improves. While the majority of employers plan to increase salaries for existing staff in 2011, 39 percent will not be providing raises. As a gesture of recognition to employees, 13 percent are offering higher titles, but without pay increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;10) Going Casual&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; Employers are becoming more relaxed about set schedules and dress codes as they take measures to enhance the overall work experience. One-third (33 percent) of employers expect to offer more flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting and alternate schedules in 2011. Fifteen percent reported they will provide a more casual dress code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/t-3z0iLmx2Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to create and lead high-performing teams</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Working in teams is often considered contrary to the American culture. Marvin Weisbord, author and organizational development expert, said, &amp;ldquo;Teamwork is the quintessential contradiction of a society grounded in individual achievement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet, building and leading an organizational culture around a successful team concept is considered a critical leadership competency. The challenges are that in any team environment people must work closely together to achieve results. They must work effectively across the organization to accomplish tasks and objectives quickly enough to remain competitive. Additional challenges include team conflicts, obtaining maximum results from virtual teams and managing highly diverse teams &amp;ndash; maintaining teamwork mentality while capitalizing on the diversity of talents, skills, knowledge and personalities within the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding the Theory Behind Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Psychologist Bruce Tuckman first came up with the descriptors &amp;ldquo;Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing&amp;rdquo; back in 1965 to describe the growth stages of teams. There is value in reviewing these descriptors and the leader&amp;rsquo;s role at each stage of the team development in order to understand the complexity of creating and managing high-performing teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Forming:&lt;/strong&gt; Teams initially go through a Forming stage in which members are usually positive and polite. At this point, team members are experiencing a myriad of emotions. Some members may be anxious, not yet knowing exactly what is expected of them. Others may be excited by the prospect of being part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This stage is typically fairly short, maybe only lasting as long as the first meeting. It is at this stage that team members are introduced to one another, goals and objectives are stated, discussions are held delineating how work will be accomplished within the team and how goals and objectives will be met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities at the Forming stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish clear objectives and team accountability expectations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove roadblocks that may prevent the team from accomplishing goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide timely feedback on the team&amp;rsquo;s progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Storming:&lt;/strong&gt; At this stage, reality sets in. Team members may jockey for position and seek clarification of their roles. The rules are now defined. Some people are ready to get to the tasks of the team, while others may be feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work to be accomplished. The goal(s) and the worthiness of the team objectives may be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This stage can be very emotional. Everyone is often on a different page. They may feel frustrated trying to accomplish goals and objectives for which they will be held accountable when they do not feel that they have neither the support of established processes nor the support of fellow team members. This is the stage where many teams fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities at the Storming stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assist the team in establishing processes and structure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Resolve team conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assist the team members in building good working relationships&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide support to individual team members who may be struggling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove roadblocks that prevent the team from accomplishing goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide timely feedback on the team&amp;rsquo;s progres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Norming:&lt;/strong&gt; If the team makes it through the Storming stage, eventually they move into the Norming stage. Natural leaders emerge, the team is beginning to work synergistically, relying on one another for advice and help, and they may even be socializing together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There may be an overlap between the Storming and Norming stage. As new and more challenging tasks arise, the team may lapse back into the Storming stage. With time and as trust builds among the team members, the Storming behaviors eventually cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities at the Norming stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Allow the team to work more independently&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide support in the form of resources, training to develop the skills necessary to perform their jobs, and/or teambuilding events&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove roadblocks that may prevent the team from accomplishing goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide timely feedback on the team&amp;rsquo;s progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Performing:&lt;/strong&gt; When the team reaches this stage, the members are working collaboratively toward achieving goals. The processes and structure for accomplishing tasks is securely in place and there tends to be little, if any, destructive conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this stage, leaders are able to delegate more work to the team and can also focus on developing the team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities at the Performing stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Delegate at much as it is reasonable to do so&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Allow the team as much autonomy as possible/trust them to work on their own with minimal check-ins from you&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Remove roadblocks that may prevent the team from accomplishing goals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide timely feedback on the team&amp;rsquo;s progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a team leader, your overarching goal is to help the team to reach the Performing stage as soon as possible. The following steps will help to ensure that you are doing the right thing at the right time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regularly assess the team&amp;rsquo;s dynamics to identify at which stage of team development your team is operating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Consider what needs to be done to move the team effectively towards the Performing stage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Schedule regular reviews of where the team is in the four-stage development process and adjust your behavior and leadership approach to suit the stage your team has reached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading Virtual (Geographically Dispersed) Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Teams that are dispersed across large geographic areas, whether nationally, internationally or within regions, pose unique challenges to the leader. Everything that we have discussed about high-performing teams also applies to virtual teams. What changes is the method for leading and communicating with these dispersed teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Communication becomes the most obvious challenge among dispersed teams. Interaction for dispersed teams relies on technology which can be both facilitating and limiting. In dispersed teams, technology becomes a critical component for effective and timely sharing of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the increased opportunities for miscommunication, it is critically important that the right technology for the team be utilized. In the case of dispersed teams that must relying on technology for communication: Role clarity, clarity of purpose, vision and goal setting become critically important to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dispersed teams have an especially challenging time in the Forming and Storming stages of team development since face-to-face interaction may be limited or even impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders can mitigate the challenges for virtual teams by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ensure that the technology chosen for communication meets the needs of the group and promotes ease of access to team members and other information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		As with traditional teams yet even more so, clearly communicate the vision for accomplishing goals and objectives and clearly describe expectations for team members&amp;rsquo; results and behaviors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make scheduled and conscious connections: Whenever possible, get the team together face-to-face for social and business interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resolving Team Conflicts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The key advantage that teams have over individuals is the diversity of resources, talents, knowledge, and ideas. Yet the very attribute of diversity is also the driving force behind team conflicts. Differences in terms of power, attitudes, values and social factors can all contribute to team conflicts. In this case, we are talking about destructive conflict &amp;ndash; the type of conflict that erodes trust, breaks down relationships, and inhibits productivity. The following are key steps for effective team conflict resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1) Do not ignore the conflict hoping it will go away. The best approach is the direct approach to eliminate the conflict before irreparable damage is done to the team. When a conflict is ignored, team members have a chance to choose sides and create cliques. As soon as the leader becomes aware of conflict within the team, it must be addressed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Provide objective guidance and support to resolve the conflict. The leader cannot effectively resolve the conflict if he or she takes sides or has a preformed opinion of who is to blame.While it may seem logical, never tell the team to work it out among themselves. If they could have worked it out without your help, they would have done so. What they need from the leader is guidance to talk it through and arrive at a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3) Ensure that each person has a chance to talk and tell their side of the story. Have each person speak directly to the other person with the leader as mediator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4) Encourage brainstorming and collaboratively determine a solution. Develop an action plan with defined steps to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5)&amp;nbsp;Hold the involved team members accountable for living up to their end of the resolution and for delivering on all steps in the action plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring Team Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	So, how do you know when your team has reached the Performing stage? High-performing teams display certain characteristics. When seeking ways to measure team performance, it is beneficial to assess how well the team is demonstrating the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Trust and respect: &lt;/strong&gt;Trust for high-performing teams means trusting each member of the team to do his or her part to contribute to the overall success of the daily operation or project. Referred to as &amp;ldquo;behavioral integration,&amp;rdquo; trust is the process of working together closely, sharing information openly, making decisions collaboratively, and sharing risks and rewards collectively. As trust grows, teams are able to address and solve challenges, differences, and disagreements from within the team. Team members demonstrate respect for other team members&amp;rsquo; ideas, opinions, skills, and talents.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Communication within high-performing teams is clear, honest, meets everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs, and drives successful achievement of the goals and objectives. Open and honest communication is fostered in an environment of trust, where people feel safe in expressing their ideas. The more trusting the environment, the more effectively the organization will communicate. It is the leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to cultivate the environment of trust by acting as a role model and delivering on the leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities as stated above in each stage of team development.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Business results: &lt;/strong&gt;While camaraderie for the team is important, the non-negotiable is achievement of business results. The team must be delivering on at least the minimum standard of expectations. The leader must analyze and assess how well the team is meeting goals and objectives and delivering to the bottom line results. It is the leader&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to report measurable activity to the team, informing them as to whether or not they are delivering results effectively &amp;ndash; in a productive and timely manner &amp;ndash; and holding them accountable for deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celebrate Success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As a leader, it is imperative that you remember to celebrate the team&amp;rsquo;s successes to include but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Achievement of milestones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Individual&amp;rsquo;s successes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Specific team successes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Celebration takes many forms, falling into two categories: formal and informal. Formal celebrations are planned and are often more costly forms of celebration (i.e., programs involving awards, prizes and planned events). Informal celebrations typically cost little, happen frequently and tend to be more personal. Examples may be something as simple as a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; from a leader or an article detailing an individual or team&amp;rsquo;s accomplishment in the company newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I could think of no better way to wrap up this article than with this quote from Patrick Lencioni, who wrote &lt;u&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/u&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Not finance. Not strategy. Not technology. It is teamwork that remains the ultimate competitive advantage, both because it is so powerful and so rare.&amp;rdquo; If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Women in the U.S. workforce, 1970-2009</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In 2009, 59.2 percent of women were in the labor force: of 122 million women in the United States, 72 million were classified as either employed or unemployed. The percentage of women in the labor force has been relatively stable over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Employment status of women 16 years and over, 1970â2009" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2011/ted_20110105.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110105_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Women&amp;#39;s labor force participation rate peaked at 60 percent in 1999, following several decades of growth in women&amp;rsquo;s labor market participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2009, the overall unemployment rate for women was 8.1 percent: of the 72 million women in the labor force, approximately 6 million were unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/"&gt;Current Population Survey&lt;/a&gt; (CPS). To learn more, see &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook2010.htm"&gt;Women in the Labor Force: A Databook (2010 Edition)&lt;/a&gt;, BLS Report 1026, December 2010. The civilian labor force participation rate is the civilian labor force as a percent of the civilian noninstitutional population. The civilian labor force comprises all persons classified as employed or unemployed. Employed persons are those who did any work at all as paid civilians; worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm; worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in a family business; or were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness, vacation, bad weather, or another reason. Unemployed persons are those who had no employment during the survey week, were available for work at that time, and made specific efforts to find employment sometime in the prior&amp;nbsp;four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/uexx0icBrRY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Online labor demand essentially unchanged in December</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Online advertised vacancies were basically unchanged as they dipped 9,400 in December to 4,447,800, according to &lt;i&gt;The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine&lt;/i&gt; (HWOL) Data Series released on January 5. The nation&amp;#39;s Supply/Demand rate stood at 3.39 unemployed for every advertised vacancy in November (the last available unemployment data)&amp;mdash; a figure that is down from a peak of 4.73 in &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;October 2009&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Nationally, there are 10.7 million more unemployed than advertised vacancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The year 2010 ended with a continuation of the lackluster labor demand we have &amp;nbsp;seen throughout the last half of this year,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;June Shelp&lt;/span&gt;, Vice President at The Conference Board. &amp;quot;The strongest job demand was in the first quarter of the year, but the rest of the year failed to show that employers were significantly ramping up hiring across the economy. &amp;nbsp;In the last half of 2010, advertised vacancies for workers in production, transportation, and construction and maintenance occupations increased, but demand for sales staff and workers in food preparation and serving, which rose in early 2010, moderated. After a promising start, 2010 ended with the overall job market relatively flat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;REGIONAL AND STATE HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;December online job demand weakest in the Northeast &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the third month in a row, labor demand rose moderately in the West, up 12,600 in December. &amp;nbsp;California was the largest contributor with an increase of 5,900. Arizona and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt; gained 3,600 and 1,200 respectively while &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Washington&lt;/span&gt; slipped by 800 in December. &amp;nbsp;Among the smaller States, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Oregon&lt;/span&gt; rose for the third straight month, up 3,100 in December. &amp;nbsp;Nevada and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/span&gt; also posted small gains&amp;mdash;1,600 and 300 respectively. Alaska and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/span&gt; had small declines of 1,600 and 400, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The South rose by 12,500 in December. Georgia regained its prior momentum from the fall and added 7,300. Florida also experienced a respectable gain of 5,800 for December. Texas posted 4,900 advertised vacancies in December. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Maryland&lt;/span&gt; lost 3,900, while &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Virginia&lt;/span&gt; increased by 800. North Carolina fell by 3,800. Among the less populous states in the South, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Delaware&lt;/span&gt; fell for the fourth straight month (1,200). Advertised vacancies in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt; remained unchanged. &amp;nbsp;Louisiana and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/span&gt; declined 1,300 and 2,100, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, the Midwest increased by 10,600. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt; led the Midwest with its gain of 7,600.&amp;nbsp;In the past quarter, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt; has had a gain of 14,200. Ohio declined by 4,100. Labor demand in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Illinois&lt;/span&gt; had slight increases of 2,500 and 1,400 respectively.&amp;nbsp;Over the past year &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt; continues to remain on a slow upward growth path. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/span&gt; grew by 3,300 this month while &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Ohio&lt;/span&gt; fell by 4,100.&amp;nbsp;Among the States with smaller populations, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Indiana&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Missouri&lt;/span&gt; remained unchanged and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Kansas&lt;/span&gt; experienced slight losses of 700 and 300 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Northeast experienced the largest change with a decline of 20,400. New Jersey declined for the second month in a row (-7,900 in December), primarily from losses in openings for Office and Administrative Support Occupations, Computer and Mathematical Science Occupations, Sales and Related Occupations, and Management Occupations. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt; dipped for the third straight month by 1,800 in December. Both &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt; have seen slowdowns in growth for the second half of the year. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt; gained 6,700 in December. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/span&gt; held steady (300). Among the smaller States, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Maine&lt;/span&gt; lost 2,300 and 800 respectively. &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Vermont&lt;/span&gt; also experienced declines, 1,500 and 1,000 respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Supply/Demand rate for the U.S. in November (the latest month for which unemployment numbers are available) stands at 3.39, indicating that there were more than 3 unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy. Nationally, there are 10.7 million more unemployed workers than advertised vacancies. The number of advertised vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed only in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/span&gt;, where the Supply/Demand rate was 0.89. &amp;nbsp;States with the next lowest rates include &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/span&gt; (1.34), &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Alaska&lt;/span&gt; (1.40), and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/span&gt; (1.44), where the Supply/Demand rates reflected the fact that there was just over one unemployed for every online advertised vacancy. &amp;nbsp;States with the highest Supply/Demand rates are &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/span&gt; (6.11) and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt; (5.82), where there are about 6 unemployed people for every advertised vacancy. Although still among the highest in the nation, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Michigan&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s S/D rate has improved significantly from the peak of 10.2 in &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;July 2009&lt;/span&gt;, when there were just over 10 unemployed for every online advertised vacancy. &amp;nbsp;Other states with high S/D rates are &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Indiana&lt;/span&gt; (4.74) and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Florida&lt;/span&gt; (4.71).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that the Supply/Demand rate only provides a measure of relative tightness of the individual state labor markets and does not suggest that the occupations of the unemployed directly align with the occupations of the advertised vacancies (see Occupational Highlights section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;OCCUPATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labor demand in December for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales and Related up 10,300&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Production rises 8,600&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Computer and Mathematical Science slips by 8,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the top 10 occupation groups with the largest numbers of online advertised vacancies, Sales and Related occupations posted the largest December increase in the number of advertised vacancies, up 10,300 to 459,800 after three months of losses. However, unemployed workers in these occupations still outnumber advertised vacancies by 3.52 to one (based on November data, the latest unemployment data available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computer and Mathematical Science occupations posted a December decrease of 8,500 to 596,400 following gains throughout the fall. The December decline was largely due to decreases in demand for computer systems analysts and computer software applications engineers. &amp;nbsp;The number of advertised vacancies in this occupational category continues to outnumber job seekers by almost three to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand for Production occupations&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;grew by 8,600 to 120,400 and was led by an increased demand for painting, coating and decorating workers.&amp;nbsp;There still remain almost 11 unemployed workers (10.77) looking for work in Production for every advertised opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Supply/Demand rates indicated that, among the occupations with the largest number of online advertised vacancies, there is a significant difference in the number of unemployed seeking positions in these occupations. Among the top ten occupations advertised online, there were more vacancies than unemployed people seeking positions for Healthcare Practitioners (0.33), Computer and Mathematical Science (0.36), and Life, Physical, and Social Science occupations (0.81). On the other hand, in Food Preparation and Serving-Related occupations, there were over 9 people seeking jobs in this field for every online advertised vacancy (9.2) and there were over 7 unemployed looking for work in Transportation and Material Moving positions for every advertised opening (7.4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;METRO AREA HIGHLIGHTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/span&gt; have the lowest Supply/Demand rates&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Online advertised vacancies in all of the 52 largest metropolitan areas are above last year&amp;#39;s levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, all of the 52 metropolitan areas for which data are reported separately posted over-the-year increases in the number of online advertised vacancies. Among the three metro areas with the largest numbers of advertised vacancies, the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt; metro area was 19.3 percent above its &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;December 2009&lt;/span&gt; level, the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/span&gt; metro area was 5.4 percent above its &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;December 2009&lt;/span&gt; level, and the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt; metro area was 25.6 percent above last year&amp;#39;s level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of unemployed exceeded the number of advertised vacancies in all but one of the 52 metro areas for which information is reported separately (in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/span&gt; there was one vacancy for every unemployed person). Oklahoma City, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/span&gt; were the other metropolitan locations with the most favorable supply/demand rates, where the number of unemployed looking for work was only slightly larger than the number of advertised vacancies.&amp;nbsp;On the other hand, metro areas in which the respective number of unemployed is substantially above the number of online advertised vacancies include &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Riverside, Calif.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ndash; where there are&amp;nbsp;9.0unemployed people for every advertised vacancy (9.0) &amp;ndash; &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Detroit&lt;/span&gt; (5.1), &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Miami&lt;/span&gt; (5.0), and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/span&gt; (4.6).&amp;nbsp;Supply/Demand rate data are for &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;November 2010&lt;/span&gt;, the latest month for which unemployment data for local areas are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/7GWF_lZshA4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Common sense may be the key to entrepreneurial success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Groupon founder Andrew Mason is now leading what Forbes magazine labeled &amp;ldquo;the fastest-growing company in Web history.&amp;rdquo; But as a teenage entrepreneur who sold bagels to neighbors, then candy when he found it sold better, he demonstrated a specific kind of intelligence that according to new research may be central to entrepreneurial success: practical intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The research, to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal &lt;i&gt;Personnel Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, was coauthored by Barbara J. Bird, an associate professor of management at American University&amp;rsquo;s Kogod School of Business, and J. Robert Baum, an associate professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland&amp;rsquo;s Robert H. Smith School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Practical intelligence&amp;mdash;better known as common sense, know-how or street sense&amp;mdash;is perhaps best described in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms as &amp;ldquo;learning by doing.&amp;rdquo; You learn from your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some people do not learn much from their experiences and so do not accumulate much practical intelligence. Such individuals may still be extremely intelligent, but have attained their knowledge through other means&amp;mdash;such as reading or observing&amp;mdash;which are less likely to produce ready-to-use, applicable, and situation specific responses to real-life situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Entrepreneurs&amp;mdash;especially during the early stages of their start-ups&amp;mdash;have to think on their feet,&amp;rdquo; Bird said. &amp;ldquo;They have to make the best decisions possible in the least amount of time and usually with few resources. They don&amp;rsquo;t have time for in-depth analysis and usually do not have the luxury of consulting with others. They need to act. Practical intelligence empowers them to act quickly and confidently.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Through questionnaire responses from 283 founders of early stage printing and graphics businesses, Bird and Baum found that the entrepreneurs who were most likely to run rapidly growing ventures possessed relevant experience in printing and graphics, learned through hands-on experiences and active experimentation, and honed their practical intelligence by pursuing specific growth goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bird and Baum chose the printing and graphics industry because despite the fact that it is competitive, growing, and rapidly changing, trade association executives reported that several new companies were experiencing rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The questionnaire was developed and tested through interviews with 22 successful, established printing industry CEOs who had originally founded their businesses. Four hundred and seventy-two members of the largest printer trade association were asked to complete the questionnaire, which sought to measure venture and industry experience, learning orientations, practical intelligence, employment and sales, and employment and sales growth rate goals for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those asked to complete the questionnaire had&amp;nbsp;five full-time employees and had founded their companies during the past four years&amp;mdash;the typical cut off for empirical studies of new ventures in venture capital, private equity, and entrepreneurship research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practical Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our research may better help entrepreneurs understand the value of hands-on experiences and experimentation or trouble shooting in the field,&amp;rdquo; Bird said, recommending that entrepreneurs who lack relevant experience in the field in which they want to start a business find partners who have such experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While clearly, practical intelligence is critical to entrepreneurial success as it offers the &amp;ldquo;know how&amp;rdquo; to launch and grow a new venture, growth goals are equally important as they provide the motivation by focusing the know how on specific outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The research may also have practical implications for entrepreneurship education, as teachers can look for ways to help students improve their practical intelligence, and for new venture funding as financiers may want to encourage learning orientations that improve entrepreneurs&amp;rsquo; practical intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/yx6xDyp5a4g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Companies relying on flexible workforces as demand for products remains uncertain</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower Inc., a world leader in innovative workforce solutions, says employers are continuing to hire flexible workers due to increased demand for their goods and services coupled with lingering economic uncertainty, as the November U.S. jobs report, released recently by the &lt;org&gt;U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/org&gt;, showed the economy only created 39,000 jobs and the unemployment rate crept up to 9.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This uncertainty over the sustainability of the recovery, and the fact that there is yet to be breakthrough in demand, means companies remain committed to doing more with less,&amp;quot; said &lt;person&gt;Jeff Joerres&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;org idsrc="xmltag.org" value="NYSE:MAN"&gt;Manpower Inc.&lt;/org&gt; chairman and CEO. &amp;quot;However, firms are seeing some demand, so they are taking on flexible or temporary workers until it becomes more robust. The number of temporary jobs created continues to rise accordingly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the elevated U.S. jobless rate is now at its highest rate since April, yesterday&amp;#39;s four-week moving average of jobless claims dropped down to 431,000, the lowest figure since &lt;chron&gt;August 2008&lt;/chron&gt;. The U.S. economy added 40,000 temporary jobs in November, and temporary jobs have been increasing since &lt;chron&gt;September 2009&lt;/chron&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mixed employment signals globally underscore the fact that although the global labor market is generally improving, the mood of optimism should be tempered with caution. With uncertainty in &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LR/eur"&gt;Europe&lt;/location&gt; making the headlines, &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/de"&gt;Germany&lt;/location&gt; remains a growth engine and employment is up in &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/fr"&gt;France&lt;/location&gt; as &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/it"&gt;Italy&lt;/location&gt;, &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/ie"&gt;Ireland&lt;/location&gt;, &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/es"&gt;Spain&lt;/location&gt;, &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/gr"&gt;Greece&lt;/location&gt; and &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/pt"&gt;Portugal&lt;/location&gt; struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In countries such as &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/de"&gt;Germany&lt;/location&gt; and &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LR/asp"&gt;Asia-Pacific&lt;/location&gt; nations where the recovery is gathering pace, the biggest threat to growth is the mismatch between the skills employers need and the talent available. Where employers are hiring in the U.S., they are being very specific about the skills they are looking for, which means workers who have recently been laid off are faring better than the long-term unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Employers are worried that candidates who have been out work for extended periods may have suffered from antiquation of their skills, which is a red flag when they are searching for such specificity of skills,&amp;quot; added Joerres. &amp;quot;December and January are traditionally weak months for hiring, so we think it will be a while yet before we see the much-awaited breakthrough in hiring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/JXvc6Znt42k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Untapped youth labor pool Is hindering global economic recovery</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower Inc., a world leader in innovative workforce solutions, stressed that a multifaceted approach to tackling high levels of global youth unemployment is essential to preventing a &amp;quot;lost generation&amp;quot; of talent which will harm economic growth and exacerbate social problems, at the 2010 CNBC &amp;amp; Blackstone Global Youth Employment Agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	David Arkless, &lt;org idsrc="xmltag.org" value="NYSE:MAN"&gt;Manpower Inc.&lt;/org&gt; president of corporate and government affairs, was a panelist at a session titled &amp;quot;Multifaceted Approach to Affecting Youth Employment,&amp;quot; with Manpower featured as a partner of the event. As global economic uncertainty continues in many economies, young people in particular are suffering high levels of unemployment in many parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Youth unemployment is a growing problem almost everywhere and the implications are frightening,&amp;quot; said Arkless. &amp;quot;Not only are the social costs high, as youth with little hope for the future may see no alternative to criminal activities, but with shifting demographics and working populations getting older, the world simply cannot afford for the next generation to be left on the sidelines of work as we face a worsening talent mismatch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the biggest challenges in tackling high youth unemployment is bridging the gap between the skills employers are looking for and what students are actually being equipped with for the workplace by educational programs. A 2009 OECD report on vocational and educational training attributed the often unsatisfactory student preparation to the difficulty of accurately forecasting the skills that will be in demand in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower&amp;#39;s recent fifth annual talent shortage survey showed that skilled trades are the hardest positions to fill globally, and an &lt;chron&gt;August 2010&lt;/chron&gt; Manpower paper titled &amp;quot;Strategic Migration &amp;ndash; A Short-term Solution to the Skilled Trades Shortage&amp;quot; argued that one solution to this skills mismatch was to promote positive attitudes toward skilled trades work among the young as viable career options to pursuing university degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Young people are increasingly shying away from skilled trades work but the stakeholders who rely on skilled labor need to emphasize the appeal of the work,&amp;quot; added Arkless. &amp;quot;We need to bring honor back to the skilled trades so students and parents can see it is a potentially lucrative career path with the possibility of owning your own business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The velocity of change in the world of work means it is increasingly difficult to predict where the demand for skills will be in the future, but Manpower advises young people to keep pace with change by continually upskilling, developing &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; skills such as intellectual curiosity, empathy and strong communication skills, embracing lifelong learning and taking a pro-active approach to their own career development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The untapped youth labor pool is holding back the recovery, for instance in &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/de"&gt;Germany&lt;/location&gt;, the economy is relatively strong, yet the &lt;org&gt;Federal Labor Agency&lt;/org&gt; says skills mismatches are hindering growth,&amp;quot; said Arkless. &amp;quot;It is imperative we get this right in order to ease the global talent mismatch and create effective solutions to youth unemployment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manpower works with organizations around the world to help young people increase their opportunities for employment and build more sustainable communities. Arkless is on the board of directors of Education for Employment (EFE), with whom Manpower also has a partnership to assist first-time jobseekers in the &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LR/mde"&gt;Middle East&lt;/location&gt; and &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LB/nafr"&gt;North Africa&lt;/location&gt;. In addition, Manpower works with &lt;location idsrc="xmltag.org" value="LC/qa"&gt;Qatar&lt;/location&gt;-based social organization Silatech and Manpower Canada helps young &amp;quot;at-risk&amp;quot; women find work or return to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/ZFXpFQHayuk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Beware the 'Silver Tsunami' â Baby Boomers turn 65 in 2011</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The start of the new year marks yet another milestone for America&amp;rsquo;s Baby Boom generation, one they are not likely to welcome. The first of the Baby Boomers turn 65 in 2011. The Boomers are getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And the rest of the 76 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 are charging hard after this first batch. It has been dubbed the Silver Tsunami. The number of people age 65 and older will double between 2010 and 2050, with the number of those 85 and older increasing four fold. The question is, will the country be ready to meet the extraordinary medical and social needs that the boomers will require?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answer, according to geriatric experts at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is no. As time passes and the boomers continue to age, they will need specialized geriatric care from specialized health care professionals in specialized facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;National estimates cite approximately 7,000 geriatricians currently certified to care for the rapidly growing boomer population,&amp;rdquo; said Richard Allman, M.D., professor and director of the UAB Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Palliative Care. &amp;ldquo;Yet our society will need more than 20,000 geriatricians to accommodate the increasing demand for specialized care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And it&amp;rsquo;s not just doctors. Allman, who is also director of the Birmingham/Atlanta Veterans Administration Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) and the UAB Center for Aging, says the need for specialized caregivers for geriatrics extends beyond physicians to include nurses, therapists, dietitians, social workers and community caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Doctors alone don&amp;rsquo;t deliver geriatric care,&amp;rdquo; Allman says. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to have a team to optimize the quality of life for older people. We&amp;rsquo;re recruiting students who are dentists, physical and occupational therapists, nurses, optometrists, psychologists and a number of other disciplines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And these are the Boomers we&amp;rsquo;re talking about &amp;ndash; traditional models of old age just aren&amp;rsquo;t going to cut it. Andrew Duxbury, M.D., a UAB geriatrician, suggests that the average boomer who reaches 65 in reasonable health will live into their 80s or early 90s, and more importantly, remain healthy and active well into their 80&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Boomers have always gotten what they want when they want it, with the demographic numbers to push society to accede to their demands,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;They are not a generation to sit back and let history roll over them. They&amp;rsquo;ll go out and make their own history.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He suggests that demand for such things as joint replacements, medications to improve aches and pains of aging and bypassing of clogged arteries will all skyrocket. Duxbury says the Boomers will want the system to work around them and their active life styles and will not put up with all-day visits to the doctor. They won&amp;rsquo;t be sitting around playing shuffle board at the retirement center.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Boomers, with their health and vitality relatively intact into older age, will completely change how Americans conceive of what it means to be old,&amp;rdquo; Duxbury points out. &amp;ldquo;In 20 years, Cher, still looking the same as today, will be on her 10th farewell tour, your average senior citizen&amp;rsquo;s dance will have couples getting down to the Rolling Stones and 80-somethings will be riding their Harleys at Sturgis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Allman says there is no public policy issue of greater importance than aging, nor one that is more ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We face institutional and cultural age-ism, and people don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;They think of aging as dying and not living. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to change the culture and get people embracing the fact that aging is a good thing. If you&amp;rsquo;re aging, you&amp;rsquo;re still alive, and we really want to emphasize that people can live with high levels of function and capability. The more well-trained geriatricians we have, the more possible it is to make this a reality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Allman says there is work to be done in other fields besides medicine. Architects and engineers will need to design products, buildings and transportation facilities that are appropriate for an aged society. Educators will need to plan how to train people in mid career to do new tasks and use new technology in order to be affective workers. Businesses are going to need older workers to keep their enterprises going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We need public policy experts who know the impact of changing policy on health care costs, Social Security and retirement plans,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;We need sociologists who understand the risk of intergenerational conflict and psychologists engaged in aging work. And clearly we need optometrists and dentists and therapists and medical people in every discipline.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We need them now, and we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to need them for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The last Boomer will not die until sometime around 2080,&amp;rdquo; says Duxbury. &amp;ldquo;They will be with us a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/GulgedU5u_Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>U.S. lost 4.1% of its manufacturers, 3.3% of its manufacturing jobs in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc., publisher of industrial directories for all 50 states, has compiled a national analysis of U.S. manufacturing based on the company&amp;#39;s state-by-state reports released in calendar year 2010. According to Manufacturers&amp;#39; News, industrial employment in the United States declined 3.3 percent and the number of U.S. manufacturers fell 4.1 percent when comparing the data collected by the most recent editions of MNI&amp;#39;s directories to each state&amp;#39;s previous edition. The full analysis can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.manufacturersnews.com/news/charts/NationalManufacturingComparisonDec2010.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Manufacturers&amp;#39; News most recent editions, there are 357,862 manufacturers employing 16,257,226 that currently operate in the United States. This is compared to the 370,230 manufacturers and 16,957,982 workers recorded by the previous editions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Technology has driven down manufacturing employment,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of Manufacturers&amp;#39; News. &amp;quot;Even as demand and production return to pre-recession levels, fewer employees are needed in the manufacturing process because of automation and robotics. Highly skilled workers trained in today&amp;#39;s technology will continue to be in great demand, but the days of well-paid low-skilled assembly line workers are gone forever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to MNI, Michigan topped the list of states that lost the most industrial employment, with a decline of 79,101 jobs. California was a close second at 78,723 lost jobs. North Carolina&amp;#39;s industrial jobs fell 51,831; Indiana 39,451; and Florida 38,278. States that lost the least number of jobs included Alaska (-31); Hawaii (-754); North Dakota (-1,028) Wyoming (-1,028); and West Virginia (-1,403).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports Florida lost the most manufacturers (-932); followed by Michigan (-913); California (-819); North Carolina (-710); and Illinois (-699). North Dakota was the only state to gain manufacturers, up 14 plants or 1.1 percent. States that lost the fewest manufacturers included Alaska (-7 ); Hawaii (-15); Nebraska (-15); and Idaho (-29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News, publisher of manufacturers&amp;#39; directories since 1912, compiles and produces manufacturing guides, statistics and databases for all 50 states.

            <title>MNI releases list of top U.S. cities by number of industrial jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc., compiler and publisher of industrial directories for all 50 states, has generated a list of the top U.S. cities by number of manufacturing jobs as of year-end 2010. The full list can be seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Manufacturers&amp;#39; News, Houston takes the top spot for industrial employment with 228,226 manufacturing jobs, followed by New York with 139,127 jobs, Chicago with 108,692 and Los Angeles with 83,719. The list shows that five of the top fifty cities are located in California (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Irvine and Santa Clara), while four of the top fifty are located in Texas (Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cities that registered notable changes since MNI last compiled the list in August 2008 included Detroit, now at 45th place after falling from 29th place; Seattle, which has moved up to 34th place from 46th place in 2008, and St. Louis, which overtook Cincinnati as the nation&amp;#39;s fifth-largest city by industrial employment, and is currently home to 83,123 industrial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since August 2008, the nation&amp;#39;s top 10 industrial cities have lost a total of 95,805 manufacturing jobs, or 8.4 percent, according to MNI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data includes only establishments located within city limits. Each municipality is counted separately from its suburbs and exurbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News, Inc., publisher of manufacturers&amp;#39; directories since 1912, compiles and produces manufacturing guides, statistics and databases for all 50 states. MNI employs an 85-person editorial staff to scour yellow pages, trade journals, financial reports, and many other sources to pinpoint every manufacturing establishment in the United States. Each manufacturer is contacted throughout the year to update their profiles, including their employee counts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Mass layoff initial claims in manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In November, 12 of the 19 major industry sectors in the private economy reported over-the-year decreases in initial claims, led by manufacturing. Thirteen of the 21 manufacturing subsectors experienced over-the-year decreases in initial claims, with the largest declines in transportation equipment and in machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Initial claimants for unemployment insurance due to mass layoff events, selected manufacturing industries, November 2009 and November 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101229.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2010/ted_20101229_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing sector accounted for 23 percent of all mass layoff events and 26 percent of initial claims filed in November. In November 2009, manufacturing made up 28 percent of events and 33 percent of initial claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within manufacturing, the number of claimants in November 2010 was greatest in transportation equipment and in food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/mls/home.htm"&gt;Mass Layoffs Statistics&lt;/a&gt; program and are not seasonally adjusted.

            <title>Stronger employment trends expected for the new year, according to job forecast</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If finding a new job is on your list of &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;New Year&amp;#39;s&lt;/span&gt; resolutions, your prospects are likely to improve to some degree, according to CareerBuilder&amp;#39;s annual job forecast. More employers plan to add full-time, permanent headcount in 2011 compared to 2010 with a continued emphasis on hiring in technology and revenue-producing fields.&amp;nbsp;The survey, which was conducted by Harris Interactive from &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;November 15 to December 2, 2010&lt;/span&gt;, included more than 2,400 hiring managers and human resource professionals across industries and company sizes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;More than half of employers reported they are in a better financial position today than they were one year ago,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Matt Ferguson&lt;/span&gt;, CEO of CareerBuilder.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;2011 will usher in a healthier employment picture as business leaders grow more confident in the economy.&amp;nbsp; Our survey indicates more jobs will be added in 2011 than 2010, but job creation will remain gradual.&amp;nbsp; The year will be characterized by steady, measured gains across various industries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full-time Hiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Twenty-four percent of employers plan to hire full-time, permanent employees in 2011, up from 20 percent in 2010 and 14 percent in 2009.&amp;nbsp;Seven percent plan to decrease headcount, an improvement from 9 percent in 2010 and 16 percent in 2009. Fifty-eight percent anticipate no change in their staff levels while 11 percent are unsure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part-time Hiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Thirteen percent of employers expect to hire part-time employees in the next 12 months, up from 11 percent in 2010 and 9 percent in 2009.&amp;nbsp;Five percent plan to decrease part-time help, an improvement from 8 percent in 2010 and 14 percent in 2009. Seventy-one percent anticipate no change in their staff levels while 12 percent are unsure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contract/Temporary Hiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Businesses will be relying on interim solutions to help shoulder growing workloads.&amp;nbsp;One-third of hiring managers (34 percent) reported they will hire contract or temporary workers to supplement leaner staffs in 2011, up from 30 percent last year and 28 percent in 2009.&amp;nbsp; Of those hiring, nearly one-in-four (24 percent) expect to add more than last year. Thirty-nine percent of employers plan to transition some contract or temporary staff into full-time, permanent employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top Functional Areas for Hiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Among employers who plan to increase their full-time, permanent headcount in 2011, sales is the most popular functional area they will be hiring for as they focus on expanding their customer base and market penetration.&amp;nbsp;The top 10 functional areas for recruitment include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales &amp;ndash; 27 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Information Technology &amp;ndash; 26 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Customer Service &amp;ndash; 25 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engineering &amp;ndash; 21 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Technology &amp;ndash; 19 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Administrative &amp;ndash; 17 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Business Development &amp;ndash; 17 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Marketing &amp;ndash; 17 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Research/Development &amp;ndash; 15 percent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accounting/Finance &amp;ndash; 14 percent&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiring By Region&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Similar to last year&amp;#39;s forecast, more employers in the West plan to recruit new employees in 2011 than other regions. Twenty-six percent of hiring managers in the West reported they plan to add full-time, permanent headcount followed by 24 percent in the Northeast and 23 percent in the Midwest and South.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plans to downsize staffs are trending below the last two years.&amp;nbsp;Eight percent of employers in the South expect to decrease headcount followed by 7 percent in the Northeast, Midwest and West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiring By Company Size&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While small businesses have been slower to recover, hiring is gradually improving among companies of all sizes. Thirty percent of employers with more than 250 employees plan to increase full-time, permanent headcount in 2011, followed by 27 percent of employers with 51 to 250 employees, and 14 percent of employers with 50 or less employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Five percent of employers with 1 to 50 employees plan to reduce their workforce compared to 6 percent of businesses with 51 to 250 employees and 9 percent with more than 250 employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compensation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Forty-one percent of employers are concerned that their best talent will leave their organizations once the economy improves, as heftier workloads and longer hours take their toll on worker morale.&amp;nbsp;Sixty-one percent said they will increase compensation for their existing staff in 2011, up from 57 percent in 2010.&amp;nbsp;While most employers estimate the average raise will be 3 percent or less, one-in-10 (10 percent) expect the average increase will be 5 percent or more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thirty-one percent will provide higher initial job offers to job candidates, up from 29 percent last year.&amp;nbsp; While most increases will likely fall within the same 1 to 3 percent range, 8 percent of employers expect to up initial job offers by 5 percent or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/LLyIW1eL3GU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Poll shows cautious optimism for 2011 on hiring, salary increases and bonus awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A survey conducted in November/December by Empsight International LLC of 142 Fortune 500 and large multinational corporations regarding forecasts of 2011 salary merit increases, bonus payouts and hiring, suggests cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hiring expectations showed a significant improvement over 2009, with 39 percent of companies expecting headcount increases of 1 percent to 5 percent, and 18 percent expecting reductions of the same amount. The corresponding figures in last year&amp;#39;s edition of the survey were 21 percent and 26 percent. Retail, professional services and technology companies showed the strongest hiring forecasts. The greatest impediments to hiring were seen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The broader economic outlook (49 percent of responses)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Level of demand for company products and services (36 percent of responses)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Government regulations (8 percent of responses)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Health care costs (7 percent of responses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While there is an active societal debate on health care, this survey shows economic fundamentals are a more significant driver of hiring decisions,&amp;quot; stated Vincent McHugh, managing director of Empsight International LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey numbers, which are detailed in the link below, show salary merit budgets forecasted at 3.0 percent at median, compared to 2.6 percent in the same survey in 2009. The number of companies planning merit increases was 98 percent of the total compared with 94 percent in last year&amp;#39;s edition of the survey. Of the 11 industry group breakouts, the oil/gas/services industry group recorded the highest average merit increase, at 3.24 percent, while the insurance industry the lowest at 2.37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seventy-eight percent of companies expect to pay annual cash bonuses at the same or higher levels than last year, with 27 percent, at the executive level, expecting payouts somewhat or significantly higher. Ninety percent of companies expected their long-term incentive awards to be about the same or somewhat higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee retention, employee morale, cost of benefits, compensation competitiveness, and managerial skill levels continue to register as somewhat to very significant concerns for companies. These factors will increase in importance if there is significant growth in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey was conducted between November 18 to December 8, 2010 by Empsight International, a compensation survey and consulting firm focused on Fortune 500 and large multinational companies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Pennsylvania faces critical shortage of skilled manufacturing workers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt; is facing a critical shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, according to a new report released by the Department of Labor &amp;amp; Industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report, &amp;quot;Critical Shortages of Precision Machining and Industrial Maintenance Occupations in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s Manufacturing Sector,&amp;quot; provides details about the manufacturing industry&amp;#39;s need for a skilled and highly trained workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are 72,000 individuals working in precision machining and industrial maintenance occupations in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt;. The PA Center for Advanced Manufacturing Careers estimates that employers will need between 15,000 and 17,000 additional skilled workers during the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Modern manufacturing has come a long way from the oil-soaked machine shops of the past,&amp;quot; Deputy Secretary for Workforce Development Dr. &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Robert Garraty&lt;/span&gt; said. &amp;quot;Today&amp;#39;s employers need a workforce with the skills and specialized training necessary to operate and maintain increasingly complex, computer-controlled manufacturing systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Joined by Lancaster Workforce Investment Board executive director &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Scott Sheely&lt;/span&gt;, operations manager &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Jim Fleischer&lt;/span&gt; and senior project manager &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Jim Eichelberger&lt;/span&gt; of Hamilton Precision Metals, Garraty emphasized the need for private-public partnerships that encourage development and delivery of training opportunities tailored to manufacturers&amp;#39; workforce needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing contributes an annual economic output of &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$75.5 billion&lt;/span&gt;, accounting for approximately 14 percent of the state&amp;#39;s gross product. The report released today provides wage and employment information for occupations critical to the continued strength of &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt; manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This report lays out some of the challenges that &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/span&gt; manufacturers will face over the next 10 years,&amp;quot; Garraty said. &amp;quot;It should be used to help educators, policymakers and employers address those challenges, and to help the state avert an employment crisis in this crucial industry sector.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The PA Center for Advanced Manufacturing Careers is part of the Pennsylvania Workforce Investment Board &amp;ndash; the governor&amp;#39;s principal private-sector policy advisor on building a strong workforce development system aligned with state education and economic development goals.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Workplace faultlines can ease psychological distress among employees</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Psychological distress in the workplace costs American businesses about $193 billion annually, according to the National Mental Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Therefore organizations need to understand and address employees&amp;rsquo; mental health which can have a significant impact upon corporate effectiveness and profitability, said Chester Spell, associate professor of management at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Psychological distress is often caused by an injustice, either real or perceived, which can lead to depression, anxiety, irritability, exhaustion and disengagement from fellow workers,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;Obviously none of these are beneficial to an organization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Spell and co-researchers Katerina Bezrukova of Santa Clara University and Jamie L. Perry, a doctoral candidate at Rutgers, undertook a study to determine if the composition of work groups could play a role in reducing psychological distress arising from injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Men and women who held jobs and were enrolled in evening graduate courses were asked to distributed questionnaires to their respective work groups seeking information about injustices, demographics and psychological distress. In all, more than 675 questionnaires were returned from a cross section of industrial groups, including retail or wholesale trade, manufacturing, hospitals, real estate, insurance and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Unfairness in the workplace affecting job performance, satisfaction and other attitudes and behaviors has been the subject of considerable research but we looked at psychological distress as an outcome of injustice,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Injustice takes on several forms and we focused on four, including 1) procedural, which has to do with the way decisions are made for the workplace group; 2) distributive, the perceived fairness of outcome distributions such as bonuses and pay raises; 3) informational, which is providing adequate and honest explanations for company decisions, and 4) interpersonal, which is the perceived fairness in treating individuals with dignity, respect and courtesy by supervisors or administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the four, interpersonal injustice had the strongest effect on psychological distress, said Spell. Distributive injustice was next strongest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;As expected, our results indicate that employees who feel their supervisors did not support them or look out for their interests were the most distressed,&amp;rdquo; Spell said. He added that injustices, bullying or abuse directed personally at an employee can hurt to the core, especially if done in front of others. &amp;ldquo;Such an attack really sticks on a person and affects their mental health in that workplace situation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So how can work groups alleviate injustices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One way, the researchers argue, is through demographic faultlines, which are alignments of group member characteristics (eg. age, gender, seniority, education). &amp;ldquo;Faultlines are often considered disruptive and can cause rifts within the workplace. In fact, previous research has focused on how faultlines can create an environment of distrust, conflict and other problems,&amp;rdquo; Spell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, there can be a positive side to these workplace divisions which can be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We found that members of subgroups within a group with a faultline can cope with injustice by cooperating with each other and lessen the effects of injustice on psychological distress,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;For example, take a work group comprised of both senior male engineers nearing retirement as well as young female sales agents who are fairly recent graduates of a business school and who have not had a great amount of work experience. Two distinct subgroups are formed by a faultline based upon members&amp;rsquo; differences in age, gender, experience and educational background,&amp;rdquo; Spell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There could be a rift between the old and young group members that could result in a dysfunctional workplace and hurt productivity. On the other hand, there could be a sense of cooperation involving the older group&amp;rsquo;s talents and experience combined with the younger group&amp;rsquo;s eagerness to learn and enthusiasm. Both subgroups could recognize the abilities of each other and use them as leverage to be productive,&amp;rdquo; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Injustices can vary across groups depending upon their demographic composition. When, for example, office policies seem to affect one subgroup more than others, they will often create an informal pact to address the supervisor about the perceived injustice. &amp;ldquo;People who are more alike (women, older people, occupational groups, etc.) may do this to protect themselves,&amp;rdquo; said Spell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study found that faultline subgroups tend to support their fellow workers who seem to be the target of unfair treatment. &amp;ldquo;They can offer their concerns and help make other employees feel better about the interpersonal injustice inflicted upon their co-workers,&amp;rdquo; said Spell. &amp;ldquo;This support, in turn, shows how faultlines can be &amp;lsquo;healthy divides&amp;rsquo; by providing a potential coping mechanism for workplace injustices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He said this finding runs counter to the notion that faultlines are dysfunctional.&lt;br /&gt;
	Spell said managers should be aware of the composition of work groups within the organization since faultlines are common in groups because of globalization and diversification of the workplace. For example, if an organization has gone through downsizing and layoffs and surviving employees are experiencing anxiety about their jobs, managers should recognize that groups with faultlines may actually buffer the effects of workforce reductions on employees&amp;rsquo; psychological well being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This can be accomplished, said Spell, by the employees interacting with each other to discuss their workplace situations, within their respective subgroups.&lt;br /&gt;
	Often employees dealing with an injustice that is causing personal distress have limited responses. &amp;ldquo;They can take their grievance directly to their supervisor, go above the supervisor to complain or seek legal recourse, none of which they are comfortable pursuing. Another course is to quit, also not what an employee wants,&amp;rdquo; Spell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	People in work groups with faultline subgroup similarities tend to gravitate toward each other based upon their similarities. &amp;ldquo;I call that a &amp;lsquo;safe harbor&amp;rsquo; where employees are comfortable with each other and can confide about office problems. It provides a social support mechanism which can help relieve distress and this is healthy,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Managers want work groups to be productive and work together, so it becomes important to pay attention to the individual culture of the faultline subgroups as well as the work group as a whole. It is critical for managers to be aware of their work force&amp;rsquo;s makeup and how natural splits in groups can be leveraged for positive rather than negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Faultline or work group composition can be a fine line and it is the wise manager who recognizes this and can leverage them to the advantage of the work group and the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) is an international group of more than 7,800 industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists whose members study and apply scientific principles concerning workplace productivity, motivation, leadership and engagement. SIOP&amp;rsquo;s mission is to enhance human well-being and performance in organizational and work settings by promoting the science, practice and teaching of I-O psychology.

            <title>Manufacturing accounts for 23% of November mass layoffs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Employers took 1,586 mass layoff actions in November involving 152,816 workers, seasonally adjusted, as measured by new filings for unemployment insurance benefits during the month, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 23. Each mass layoff involved at least 50 persons from a single employer. The number of mass layoff events in November decreased by 65 from the prior month, while the number of associated initial claims increased by 4,757. In November, 354 mass layoff events were reported in the manufacturing sector, seasonally adjusted, resulting in 39,465 initial claims. Over the month, the number of manufacturing events decreased slightly, while associated initial claims increased by 2,027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in November, up from 9.6 percent the prior month and down from 10.0 percent a year earlier. In November, total non-farm payroll employment increased by 39,000 over the month and by 842,000 from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry Distribution (Not Seasonally Adjusted)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The number of mass layoff events in November was 1,676 on a not seasonally adjusted basis; the number of associated initial claims was 158,048. Over the year, the number of mass layoff events decreased by 194, and associated initial claims decreased by 6,448. Twelve of the 19 major industry sectors in the private economy reported over-the-year decreases in initial claims, led by manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing sector accounted for 23 percent of all mass layoff events and 26 percent of initial claims filed in November. A year earlier, manufacturing made up 28 percent of events and 33 percent of initial claims. Within manufacturing, the number of claimants in November was greatest in transportation equipment and in food. Thirteen of the 21 manufacturing subsectors experienced over-the-year decreases in initial claims, with the largest declines in transportation equipment and in machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geographic Distribution (Not Seasonally Adjusted)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Two of the four regions and five of the nine divisions experienced over-the-year decreases in initial claims due to mass layoffs in November. Among the census regions, the Midwest registered the largest over-the-year decline in initial claims. Of the geographic divisions, the East North Central had the largest over-the-year decline in initial claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California recorded the highest number of initial claims in November, followed by Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia experienced over-the-year decreases in initial claims, led by Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Kentucky and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/Xfy0Ub_EBb0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chart: Real earnings changes by month since November 2009</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for all employees fell 0.1 percent from October to November, seasonally adjusted. This decrease stems from a 0.1-percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), while average hourly earnings remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Real average weekly earnings fell 0.1 percent over the month, as the average workweek remained unchanged and real average hourly earnings declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings rose 0.6 percent, seasonally adjusted, from November 2009 to November 2010. A 1.2-percent increase in average weekly hours, combined with the increase in real average hourly earnings, resulted in a 1.7-percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Survey reveals 76% of employees have stolen from workplace</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Seventy-six percent of employees have stolen from their place of work according to a recent survey conducted by office design company Maris Interiors. Men are particularly light-fingered, with an astonishing 82 percent admitting to helping themselves, compared to 71 percent of women surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The stationery cupboard was hardest hit, with pens (60 percent) and printer paper (42 percent) being the most commonly pilfered. Stamps (31 percent), mugs (28 percent) and toilet paper (24 percent) were also frequently taken items. The stapler &amp;ndash; often thought of as a frequent target of office thieves &amp;ndash; was only taken by 6 percent of those surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One in 20 employees admitted to having taken more valuable items &amp;ndash; ranging from printer toner to laptops. More unusual items declared included chairs and office plants, even filing cabinets, carpet tiles and entire desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maris Interiors chairman Michael Howard said, &amp;quot;We all know that the stationery cupboard suffers a bit, but we were extremely surprised that the numbers were quite so high. The mind boggles why someone would take their desk home &amp;ndash; not to mention quite how they managed it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/QviIafB2TKg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Are you a workaholic? Check out the survey and find out!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Do you spend most of your day &amp;ndash; including your free time &amp;ndash; thinking about work? Are you more concerned about what your boss thinks than your family? Would you rather be in your cubicle than in your home? A new study from CareerBuilder looks at indicators of being addicted to work and what workers can do to find a happy medium between work and personal time in the New Year. The nationwide survey was conducted between August 17 and September 2, 2010 and included more than 3,100 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2010 brought with it leaner staffs and heftier workloads. More than half of workers (52 percent) reported they put in more than 40 hours a week. Fourteen percent work more than 50 hours. Thirty-one percent bring home work at least once a week; one-in-ten bring home work at least every other day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a quarter of workers, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to leave the office behind once they leave for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		24 percent of workers reported that when they&amp;rsquo;re at home or out socially, they&amp;rsquo;re still thinking about work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		19 percent often dream about work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		16 percent stated that most of their conversations &amp;ndash; at work, home or out socially &amp;ndash; always tend to focus on work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extended workdays and an unwavering focus on business while at home are taking a toll on family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		22 percent of workers reported they don&amp;rsquo;t have time to pursue personal interests because they say they&amp;rsquo;re always working.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		15 reported that they would rather be working than at home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		12 percent said the amount of time spent on work is causing friction with their family.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		9 percent are more concerned about approval from their boss than their family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Workers reported increased stress levels and health complications tied to pressures at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		51 percent of workers reported their workloads have increased over the last six months.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		27 percent have not taken a personal or sick day in the last few years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		26 percent have experienced health issues tied to stress on the job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With increased demands at the office and greater accessibility through mobile devices, the workday literally never ends for some workers,&amp;rdquo; said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder. &amp;ldquo;While a strong work ethic is valued, a lack of balance with your personal life can ultimately work against you in the long run. As the year wraps up, take inventory of your personal time and see where you need to make adjustments in 2011.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Haefner offers the following tips to achieve a more manageable schedule and better work/life balance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Set aside personal time.&lt;/strong&gt;You schedule business meetings and events. Do the same for &amp;ldquo;me time&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;family time&amp;rdquo; and stick to the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;2) Let go.&lt;/b&gt; Learn to delegate work-related tasks and responsibilities to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;3)Take off the e-leash.&lt;/b&gt; In most cases, that email or text can wait. Turn off your electronic devices at a certain time. Take care of personal commitments and put the kids to bed before turning it back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;4)Talk to others who understand your situation.&lt;/b&gt; Check out support groups such as Workaholics Anonymous and find out what others have done in their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/LIX2l5TJXHg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Steelworkers union condemns lockout of members by Titan Tire</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The United Steelworkers (USW) on December 18 condemned Titan Tire&amp;#39;s lockout of approximately 1,000 members at the company&amp;#39;s Bryan, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; and Freeport, Ill., facilities. The company&amp;#39;s actions came despite the union informing the company that it would hold information meetings and a vote on the company&amp;#39;s proposal for contracts covering the three facilities within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Jim Robinson, chairman of the USW&amp;#39;s Negotiating Committee and Director of USW District 7, criticized the action saying, &amp;quot;Titan&amp;#39;s lock out of 1,000 of our members at all three of its tire-making facilities is completely unnecessary and entirely premature.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The USW and Titan began negotiations in September and were working towards a contract that contained changes the company stated it needed to regain profitability at the three USW-represented plants. Although the contract technically expired on November 19, the USW and company agreed to extend negotiations until December 17 to continue the progress in negotiations. However, the company informed the union mid-week that it would not agree to a further extension and would lock out workers, completely ceasing its tire production, unless an agreement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Robinson explained that, &amp;quot;The company&amp;#39;s proposal falls far short of what we would like to see and we would much rather have continued to negotiate and reach a mutually-acceptable deal. However, due to the company&amp;#39;s intransigence and its declaration that it would lock out our members, we made it clear to the company that we would continue to work, take their contract proposal back to our members, explain it and have the members vote. Despite our commitment, Titan chose to shut its doors and lock our members out the week before Christmas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The union will follow-through on its commitment and will hold explanation meetings at each of the facilities over the course of the next few days culminating in the membership voting on the contracts on Thursday, December 23. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The USW represents 850,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada employed in the metals, rubber, chemicals, paper, oil refining and the service sector industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/lauwUWtCgXY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Are you a drainer? 12 energy-depleting behaviors to avoid at work</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s been a long, exhausting year at your workplace. You&amp;#39;re tired, depleted and quite frankly just done with &amp;quot;business as usual.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re laying the blame for your fatigue squarely at the feet of the increased responsibilities and long hours you&amp;#39;ve been facing. But according to Jon Gordon, you might be wrong. He insists that working hard &amp;ndash; when done with a good attitude in the right environment &amp;ndash; can actually be quite invigorating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In other words, what&amp;#39;s wearing you out at work might not be the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Most people wrongly assume that their tasks and responsibilities are what&amp;#39;s grinding them down,&amp;quot; explains Gordon, author of the newly released &amp;ldquo;Soup: A Recipe to Nourish Your Team and Culture&amp;rdquo; (Wiley, 2010, ISBN: 978-0-4704878-4-6, $22.95, &lt;a href="http://www.mmsend2.com/link.cfm?r=25150338&amp;amp;sid=11704019&amp;amp;m=1189035&amp;amp;u=RocksPR&amp;amp;s=http://www.soup11.com/"&gt;www.Soup11.com&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;quot;However, while &amp;#39;work&amp;#39; is a convenient scapegoat, the real culprit is often the negativity of the people you work with and for, their constant complaining and the pessimistic culture that is now the norm in a lot of workplaces.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact is, many of us work in a world of drainers. And what, exactly, is a drainer? Gordon says the term can describe anyone in the workplace &amp;ndash; a boss, co-worker, employee or client &amp;ndash; who sucks the life and energy right out of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No one sets out to be a drainer, of course. It&amp;#39;s just that some people regularly (and inadvertently) exhibit energy-draining behaviors. What&amp;#39;s worse, many bosses allow them to continue &amp;ndash; or are themselves guilty of practicing these behaviors. And over time, the entire culture becomes poisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;#39;t fret, though: Gordon promises that if managers are able to identify the offending behaviors and fix them, they&amp;#39;ll be able to spend more time nourishing their companies&amp;#39; cultures &amp;ndash; which will, in turn, make employees happier and more productive, thus increasing the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Soup &amp;ndash; written in a fun business fable format (much like his Wall Street Journal and international bestseller, The Energy Bus and several other titles) &amp;ndash; Gordon lays out the ingredients that make up a nourishing culture, instead of a draining one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Read on for Gordon&amp;#39;s top twelve draining behaviors (presented in a what-not-to-do format), as well as tips for how you can make a change for the better in each of these situations this New Year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1. The Energy Vampire Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Let negativity become your go-to response. &lt;/strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing more draining than a boss or coworker who is constantly negative. Gordon calls these folks &amp;quot;energy vampires.&amp;quot; They are never happy, rarely supportive and constantly nay-saying any and all ideas and suggestions that aren&amp;#39;t their own. According to them, you might as well give up before you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Respond constructively when someone offers up an idea. &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you know more about a particular project, have more experience than the rest of your team or are positive that the suggestions others are making are off the mark, hear them out. Let employees and coworkers know that when they come to you with their ideas, they&amp;#39;ll be heard with an open mind and received with respect. Insist that everyone else practice positivity as well. While negativity squelches creativity and initiative, an encouraging attitude will keep creative juices flowing and encourage constructive dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As pessimism rises, performance decreases,&amp;quot; Gordon explains. &amp;quot;You have to encourage optimism and guard against pessimism or your team will suffer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2. The Out-of-Control Complain Train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Give in to the temptation to whine.&lt;/strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s a well-known phenomenon that can have catastrophic consequences: One person&amp;#39;s complaint resonates with someone else, who then proceeds to add grievances to the pile, which prompts yet another individual to throw in her two (negative) cents...and so on. Before you know it, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is complaining and any work that gets done thereafter is marred by a bad attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Push for solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;The next time a water-cooler conversation threatens to barrel out of control into Complaint Central, step in and ask the complainees how they would make things better. Better yet, take a cue from Gordon&amp;#39;s bestselling book &lt;em&gt;The No Complaining Rule &lt;/em&gt;and ban complaints altogether. It&amp;#39;s tough love for sure &amp;ndash; but it will also create and sustain a positive culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When you boil things down, complaints are just noise and nothing more &amp;ndash; but each one does represent an opportunity to turn something negative into something positive,&amp;quot; Gordon points out. &amp;quot;Turn your employees from problem-sharers to problem-solvers &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;ll make an unbelievable difference in your office&amp;#39;s atmosphere!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3. The Vicious Voicemail (or Email)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Leave critical or harsh messages on voicemail or send them to an email inbox. &lt;/strong&gt;Nine times out of ten, these critiques seem much more vehement and condemnatory than they actually are. Plus, any communication you send via electronic methods can potentially last forever. Not only could your words come back to haunt you, they&amp;#39;ll also be a constant reminder to your coworker or employee of his or her supposed shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Suck it up and conduct the tough talks in person. &lt;/strong&gt;If you need to have a stern talk with someone or if you need to talk through a conflict or problem, do it in person if at all possible. You&amp;#39;ll be able to ensure that your words and tone aren&amp;#39;t misinterpreted and you&amp;#39;ll be able to immediately have a constructive dialogue with the other person. By talking about ways to improve, you can end the conversation on a positive and encouraging note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. The Loaded Monday Morning Inbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Overwhelm your team with a mountain of emails before the week is underway. &lt;/strong&gt;If you&amp;#39;re finishing up your own to-do list late on a Friday night or if you&amp;#39;re simply trying to get a jumpstart on the week ahead, it can be tempting to dish out the details and to-dos as you think of them. After all, if you wait &amp;#39;til Monday morning, you might forget to tell those who need to know! However, coming in to an inbox of fifty-seven new messages is draining and makes folks feel like they&amp;#39;re fighting an uphill battle from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Boil down and bundle your communication as considerately as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;Inevitably, people are going to be working late and sending emails over the weekend &amp;ndash; in today&amp;#39;s business culture, it&amp;#39;s unavoidable! However, there are a few things you can do to make &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve Got Mail!&amp;quot; less stressful and more efficient for the recipient. Be sure to flag any urgent emails so that your teammates know which tasks to tackle first &amp;ndash; and include as many details as possible so that 1) you won&amp;#39;t forget them and 2) the recipient can get started as quickly as possible. If you can, combine as many of the tasks and questions as you can into one document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;One email as opposed to ten separate ones is a lot less intimidating,&amp;quot; reminds Gordon. &amp;quot;And if you do fire off a multitude of messages in a moment of panic, a quick note acknowledging the unusual volume can change everything!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5. The Busy Bee Bamboozle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Confuse activity with progress. &lt;/strong&gt;You know the person. She&amp;#39;s always soooo busy but doesn&amp;#39;t ever seem to meet deadlines or get anything done. When teams are being formed, people secretly hope she isn&amp;#39;t assigned to theirs. She&amp;#39;s living proof of the fact that just because your day is full of things to do doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that you&amp;#39;re getting them done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Set goals and hold yourself and your employees accountable for results. &lt;/strong&gt;These results should be ones that &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; and that are visible and valuable to your team. It can be helpful to transition over to a day-to-day plan that will help everyone stay on the right track. Most importantly, don&amp;#39;t put your team in situations where the lines are blurred. If the goals are crystal clear, they&amp;#39;ll be easier to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6. The Low Performer Look-Away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Let sub-par work slide. &lt;/strong&gt;Simply put, low performers drag the rest of the team down. They are like a cancer inside your organization, creating resentment and generating more work for everyone else. And if you allow them to linger and thrive for too long, your best employees will move on to a more productive environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Institute a zero-tolerance policy for low performers. &lt;/strong&gt;Hold your entire team accountable for meeting their goals and adhering to the same performance standards. If one person consistently misses the bar, then you need to take swift action. Let your employees know that you value their hard work and that you will not allow others to do less and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In support of this initiative, strive for complete transparency,&amp;quot; Gordon advises. &amp;quot;When your team knows exactly what&amp;#39;s expected, they&amp;#39;ll know where they stand &amp;ndash; and you&amp;#39;ll be able to make sure that their fears, uncertainties and questions aren&amp;#39;t holding them back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unclear Communiqu&amp;eacute; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Assume others have all the information they need or that something you know isn&amp;#39;t really all that important. &lt;/strong&gt;These hastily drawn conclusions that result from chronic poor communication can lead to serious mistakes and major missed opportunities. Plus, lack of clarity is incredibly frustrating to those who must work with you. When employees, coworkers or supervisors have to spend their time tracking you down for clarification, rather than getting the communication from you that they need, productivity falls and creativity is stifled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Make a concerted and proactive effort to make sure that the right people are in the know. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it&amp;#39;s letting your boss know that a client&amp;#39;s daughter is getting married (so he can call in congratulations) or telling a coworker that a vendor prefers to be contacted only via email, be sure to tell the appropriate people. You&amp;#39;ll set your entire team up for success and ensure that your clients get the service they deserve. Also, make sure you copy the right people on emails, promptly return voicemails and are clear about directions and expectations. And if you say you are going to do something, mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A big part of a successful culture is having a relationship between employees and managers that is built on trust and collaboration,&amp;quot; says Gordon. &amp;quot;And that can happen only if a clear line of communication is established so that inspiration, encouragement, empowerment and coaching can take place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8. The Disorganization Drag-Down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Allow disorganization to impede productivity.&lt;/strong&gt;If you&amp;#39;re managing or leading a company, heading up a big project or traveling non-stop, it&amp;#39;s likely you&amp;#39;ve lost an email, important paper, phone number or pie chart or two (or three or four) in your day. You&amp;#39;re busy and that&amp;#39;s understandable. But constant disorganization can drain your employees and coworkers if they always have to cover your tracks. It may not always be possible and accidents do happen &amp;ndash; but not being able to find the quarterly report for the third meeting in a row sets a bad example and it depletes others of the energy they could be putting towards other, more productive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Make a concerted effort to keep up with your tasks and responsibilities.&lt;/strong&gt;And if you can&amp;#39;t immediately put your hands on something you need, don&amp;#39;t automatically ask others for help. Take a few minutes to try and find what you need on your own. Better yet, try to think of better systems and processes than the ones you&amp;#39;re using (or not using) now. If you see that someone in your office has a particular knack for organization, ask her for some tips to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Remember that there&amp;#39;s no substitute for communication when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; drop the ball,&amp;quot; Gordon instructs. &amp;quot;Tell your employees that between travel, a jam-packed schedule and working between two computers and a smartphone, you&amp;#39;ve lost something you shouldn&amp;#39;t have. If you are humble and honest about it, they&amp;#39;ll be more sympathetic to your plight and more likely to jump in and help you keep things organized!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9. The Hasty Plate Clear-Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Sacrifice quality on the altar of expediency. &lt;/strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of work to do and you (understandably) want to get your own tasks done so you don&amp;#39;t hold up others. However, moving through assignments quickly in order to get them off your own plate can also mean that you&amp;#39;re piling the work on someone else. If you&amp;#39;ve rushed, you&amp;#39;re more likely to have made mistakes and been sloppy, which isn&amp;#39;t fair to the person who gets the assignment after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Take the time you need to do the job right. &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than rushing through a report or clicking &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; just because it&amp;#39;s 5:00 p.m., get focused and make sure you do your best work the first time. Pay attention to details, check over your work and make sure you&amp;#39;ve followed the proper guidelines. Your coworkers and employees would rather have a project that&amp;#39;s done right than one that&amp;#39;s ahead of schedule. (And if you have to turn in a project a day late on occasion, it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Doing your best work sets the rest of your team up for success,&amp;quot; notes Gordon. &amp;quot;When people realize that you&amp;#39;re this kind of teammate, they&amp;#39;ll take on your projects with confidence and energy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;10. The Chronic Deadline Dodge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Allow unmet deadlines to throw everything and everyone off-track. &lt;/strong&gt;With all the unexpected obstacles you face in a workday, it&amp;#39;s not always easy to meet deadlines. And yes, sometimes it&amp;#39;s impossible &amp;ndash; but those times should be few and far between. When people chronically miss deadlines, it&amp;#39;s a sure sign of a cultural issue. Either people aren&amp;#39;t giving it their all &amp;ndash; or they&amp;#39;re truly overburdened. Either way, your company&amp;#39;s productivity will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Set reasonable, clear deadlines for everyone involved (and hold hem accountable). &lt;/strong&gt;Once something gets off-track, nobody is willing to own it. Make sure you set reasonable deadlines that you and your teammates can meet in order to avoid setting folks up for failure. And even if it takes some extra elbow grease from time to time, make a conscious effort to meet every deadline every time (and hold your team accountable for meeting them, too!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;11. The Unattainable Atta-Boy (or Atta-Girl!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Get so caught up in what&amp;#39;s coming down the pike that you forget to acknowledge what&amp;#39;s happening now. &lt;/strong&gt;Most managers and business leaders would agree that they feel a lot of pressure. And it can be hard for them to constantly be the ones catching the heat from the higher-ups while the rest of the employees have only their own goals to meet and worry about. However, when responsibilities give you to-do tunnel vision and cause you to skimp on the &amp;quot;job well dones,&amp;quot; employees can get discouraged in a hurry &amp;ndash; especially if you immediately ask about another goal that&amp;#39;s gone unmet or push more work at them to try and make up for losses in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Express appreciation and admiration when appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt;Employees don&amp;#39;t need a pat on the back and a round of applause at every turn. What they do need is to know that you can be satisfied. If, like a hamster running in a wheel, an employee feels as though no amount of hard work or hours spent will ever garner the boss&amp;#39;s approval or satisfaction, his energy and self-motivation will be zapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Leadership is not so much about what &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;do,&amp;quot; asserts Gordon. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s about what you can inspire, encourage, empower and coach others to do. If employees know you can be pleased and that goals can be reached, then they will happily work toward those things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;12. The Blame Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DON&amp;#39;T: Point fingers at others in order to take the heat off of yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;A mistake is made, the boss is mad, a deadline is missed. If all eyes are on your team and you start pointing fingers, you could be making a huge mistake. If your employees or your coworkers don&amp;#39;t think you shoulder your share of the blame or are unapproachable when it comes to constructive criticism, they&amp;#39;ll start to shut down toward you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;DO: Accept responsibility for your actions gracefully and humbly.&lt;/strong&gt;Nobody likes to be the one at fault. But owning up to your mistakes and learning from them are big parts of working together and being successful. If you make a mistake, be the first to own up to it and try to do things differently in the future. Also, be open to suggestions and criticisms &amp;ndash; they may make the going much smoother!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If some of these behaviors sound all too familiar, don&amp;#39;t despair. The cusp between the year that&amp;#39;s just passed and the one that&amp;#39;s to come is the perfect time to take stock of what&amp;#39;s making your culture less than nourishing &amp;ndash; and resolve to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s important for managers to acknowledge that it&amp;#39;s been a tough 12 months and that you understand why folks are feeling drained and depleted,&amp;quot; concludes Gordon. &amp;quot;Above all, tell them that you are willing and eager to help alleviate some of that stress! A little acknowledgment can go a long way toward a brighter, more productive and much more energized 2011.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Caterpillar opens contract talks with United Auto Workers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers (UAW) on December 15 began negotiations for a new labor agreement. The current contract, ratified in 2005, will expire on March 1, 2011. The agreement covers approximately 9,500 production and maintenance workers at the company&amp;#39;s Illinois facilities in Aurora, Decatur, East Peoria, Mapleton, Mossville, Morton and Pontiac, as well as those in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. The parties met today and will resume discussions tomorrow. Both parties have agreed to make no public comments to the media on contract issues during the negotiations process. The meetings are taking place in Caterpillar Building CV in East Peoria, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;#39;s opening session, the Company said it seeks to reach an agreement that is fair to all parties and helps the covered facilities compete in the international marketplace. Caterpillar also reinforced its commitment to providing competitive wages and benefits, a safe work environment and the flexibility to succeed in a volatile global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Caterpillar&amp;#39;s strategic approach to the global financial crisis was both timely and effective. Even though our sales fell $19 billion in one year, the company retained its focus on delivering excellent customer service and high quality products while reducing costs,&amp;quot; said Chris Glynn, Caterpillar&amp;#39;s director of corporate human relations. &amp;quot;As a result of these actions, we were positioned to respond as the business continues to recover and we have recalled nearly all of our production employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Glynn said that the company&amp;#39;s negotiating team would work diligently to reach an agreement that would allow these plants to compete and serve the growing global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;A strong, profitable company is the best source of long-term job security and community stability,&amp;quot; Glynn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the first meeting with representatives of the UAW, Caterpillar addressed at a high level, the competitive challenges facing the company in the post-recession marketplace. The remarks included information about the dramatic increase in the number of manufacturers of excavation and earthmoving equipment, especially in emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Caterpillar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For more than 85 years, Caterpillar Inc. has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent. With 2009 sales and revenues of $32.396 billion, Caterpillar is the world&amp;#39;s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company also is a leading services provider through Caterpillar Financial Services, Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services, Caterpillar Logistics Services and Progress Rail Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/JgXVJz8QB1I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Average hourly earnings for U.S. workers down 0.1 percent</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for all employees fell 0.1 percent from October to November, seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 15. This decrease stems from a 0.1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), while average hourly earnings remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average weekly earnings fell 0.1 percent over the month, as the average workweek remained unchanged and combined with the decline in real average hourly earnings. Over the past six months, real average weekly earnings has changed little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings rose 0.6 percent, seasonally adjusted, from November 2009 to November 2010. A 1.2 percent increase in average weekly hours, combined with the increase in real average hourly earnings, resulted in a 1.7 percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production and non-supervisory employees &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory employees fell 0.1 percent from October to November, seasonally adjusted. This result stemmed from both the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) and average hourly earnings being about unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average weekly earnings fell 0.3 percent over the month, as a result of a 0.3 percent decrease in the average work week combined with the decrease in real average hourly earnings. Over the past six months, real average weekly earnings has changed little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Real average hourly earnings rose 0.8 percent, seasonally adjusted, from November 2009 to November 2010. The increase in real average hourly earnings combined with a 0.9 percent increase in the average work week, resulted in a 1.7 percent increase in real average weekly earnings during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/cjkavaq9h6Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chart shows staggering rise in health insurance costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Family health insurance premiums more than doubled between 1999 and 2009, far outpacing the growth in workers&amp;rsquo; earnings and overall inflation. The &lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt;, from EPI&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming &lt;em&gt;State of Working America&lt;/em&gt; Web site, plots the rise in health insurance premiums against both inflation and hourly earnings for nonsupervisory and production workers, who comprise 80 percent&amp;nbsp;of the private-sector workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img src="http://www.epi.org/page/-/img/121510-snapshot.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While family health insurance premium costs grew 131% over the past 10 years, inflation over that same period rose just 28.8% and hourly earnings rose by 38.1%. Since health insurance premiums are often shared between workers and their employers, this disproportionate rise in the cost of health insurance helps illustrate why it is increasingly difficult for both employers and their workers to afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/QE8TAwHaAPY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toolwire, Auburn alliance works to engage and retain college engineering students</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Auburn University&amp;#39;s Laboratory for Innovative Technology and Engineering Education (LITEE) and Toolwire have partnered to design immersive scenarios for first-year engineering students based on LITEE&amp;#39;s case study, &lt;a href="http://www.liteecases.com/lcm/catalog/case_studies/0/sts-51_l/17/"&gt;Space Shuttle STS 51-L (Challenger)&lt;/a&gt;. Through this collaboration, Toolwire&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.toolwire.com/higher_ed/experiential_learning"&gt;experiential learning&lt;/a&gt; technology and instructional design expertise will be combined with LITEE&amp;#39;s professorial excellence and experience in mechanical engineering and its instructional material development and evaluation expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Engineering programs in the U.S. are struggling to engage and retain students. According to a 2008 study of nine institutions, retention rates of engineering majors ranged from 38 to 66 percent. LITEE&amp;#39;s response to statistics such as these was to make engineering instruction more authentic and relevant by developing 18 multi-media case studies based on situations faced by actual companies. Still, Auburn studies on student engagement showed that there was room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;To match the learning style of the students in our program, we needed to introduce a new learning modality that would provide a more hands-on and visual experience. Toolwire&amp;#39;s immersive scenarios were the perfect solution,&amp;quot; said Auburn&amp;#39;s Dr. PK Raju, Thomas Walter Distinguished Professor of mechanical engineering and director of LITEE. &amp;quot;Bringing together our university resources and experts in industry will no doubt provide the optimal approach to develop learning games that will best serve our students.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on LITEE&amp;#39;s Space Shuttle STS 51-L (Challenger) case study, the scenarios focus on two over-arching learning objectives: understanding key engineering design principles and mastering engineering communication. During these scenarios, students take on the role of a newly hired mechanical engineer within a fictitious company, Lunar Aerospace, to participate in trainings, discussions, conversations, and presentations as they learn about their new company and what it means to be an engineer. Along the way, &amp;quot;Natural Assessments&amp;quot; allow students to demonstrate command of the key topics in the same way that they would in real-life situations by communicating with their virtual &amp;quot;boss,&amp;quot; colleagues, or others within the scenario. All information provided by students in the assessment elements is captured and formatted for delivery to the course instructor for grading purposes and builds a feedback loop for further analysis and course improvements over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initial results are encouraging for the pilot scenarios, which were co-created over the summer and introduced to students during the fall semester. Seventy percent of the students have expressed interest in working with such instructional material in the future. An Auburn instructor commented, &amp;quot;Overall, this is another huge improvement to the case study. The students demonstrated genuine interest in the Toolwire scenarios. We believe that the interactive computer format provided deeper engagement in the material than that of a lecture session.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Auburn&amp;#39;s scenarios for engineering are delivered to students via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;What Toolwire does for universities is not easy &amp;ndash; it requires a centralized data center, 24x7 customer service, installation and maintenance staff, dynamic hardware deployment platforms, and software licensing,&amp;quot; commented Michael Watkins, Toolwire&amp;#39;s director of instructional design and technology. &amp;quot;We take ownership of the challenge to deliver state-of-the-art experiential learning for students through anytime access to real hardware and software that makes the experience easy, transparent and scalable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Instructional environments such as these immersive scenarios are undeniably on the threshold of cutting-edge technology in education and professional training,&amp;quot; said Dr. Chetan S. Sankar, an expert on case study development, pedagogy, and research at Auburn University who will be part of a team that closely studies how these virtual, &amp;quot;day-in-the-life&amp;quot; scenarios affect student performance and engagement. &amp;quot;Through this partnership, we will conduct research to fully understand the best ways to utilize this technology in the classroom.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toolwire was founded 15 years ago on the belief that students learn best by doing and have been deeply committed to developing a highly reliable, scalable infrastructure to deliver authentic, experiential learning solutions ever since then,&amp;quot; said John Valencia, CEO and president of Toolwire. &amp;quot;Combining these capabilities with Auburn/LITEE&amp;#39;s subject matter and educational expertise creates a unique partnership with unlimited potential to significantly enhance higher education engineering instruction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/sGWB4SX_0Mc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>CEOs forecast increased expectations for employment, sales and capital spending</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The CEOs of America&amp;rsquo;s leading companies plan increases in employment, sales and capital expenditures over the next six months, according to the results of Business Roundtable&amp;rsquo;s fourth quarter 2010 &lt;a href="http://businessroundtable.org/news-center/business-roundtable-releases-fourth-quarter-2010-ceo-economic-outlook-surve/"&gt;CEO Economic Outlook Survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p sizcache="25" sizset="40"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Demand is returning as evidenced by anticipated sales increases, and that is good news. When demand increases, capital expenditures and employment follow &amp;ndash; which is what we expect to see in the next six months,&amp;rdquo; said &lt;a href="http://businessroundtable.org/about-us/members/139"&gt;Ivan G. Seidenberg&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of Business Roundtable and chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications. &amp;ldquo;However, our CEOs expect GDP to grow at rate of only 2.5 percent in 2011, so there is still more work that needs to be done to get the economy back on the path toward strong, sustainable growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The survey&amp;rsquo;s key findings from this quarter and the third quarter of 2010 include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://businessroundtable.org/uploads/general/press%20release%201.jpg" style="width: 449px; height: 151px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In terms of the overall U.S. economy, member CEOs estimate real GDP will grow by 2.5 percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Pressures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This quarter&amp;rsquo;s survey also asked member CEOs to identify their greatest cost pressures. Materials, health care and labor costs ranked among the CEOs&amp;rsquo; top concerns. About one-third of CEOs named materials costs as having the greatest impact among a diverse range of pressures that include pension, litigation and energy expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://businessroundtable.org/uploads/general/press%20release%202.jpg" style="width: 348px; height: 275px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Copper prices and corn prices are at near record highs. Cotton prices and most metals prices are also very high,&amp;rdquo; added Seidenberg. &amp;ldquo;As a result of these marked increases, materials are being cited as the greatest cost pressure, with health care costs coming in next as a significant cost pressure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Quarter 2010 CEO Economic Outlook Survey Index&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Survey Index increased to 101 in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from 86 in the third quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://businessroundtable.org/uploads/general/press%20release%203.jpg" style="width: 369px; height: 263px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Business Roundtable&amp;rsquo;s CEO Economic Outlook Survey, conducted quarterly since the fourth quarter of 2002, provides a forward-looking view of the economy by Business Roundtable member CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p sizcache="25" sizset="41"&gt;
	The survey was completed between November 8 and December 3. The percentages in some categories may not equal 100 due to rounding. Results of this and all previous surveys can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.businessroundtable.org/ceo_survey"&gt;http://www.businessroundtable.org/ceo_survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		Business Roundtable is an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies with nearly $6 trillion in annual revenues and more than 12 million employees. Member companies comprise nearly a third of the total value of the U.S. stock markets and pay more than 60 percent of all corporate income taxes paid to the federal government. Annually, they pay more than $167 billion in dividends to shareholders and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Business Roundtable companies give more than $7 billion a year in combined charitable contributions, representing nearly 60 percent of total corporate giving. They are technology innovation leaders, with more than $111 billion in annual research and development spending &amp;ndash; nearly half of all total private R&amp;amp;D spending in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Insurance benefits costs for employers in private industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Average costs in private industry for insurance benefits were $2.24 per hour worked, or 8.0 percent of total compensation in September 2010. Among occupational groups, employer costs for insurance benefits ranged from 97 cents per hour worked (or 7.0 percent of total compensation) for service occupations, to $3.32 per hour worked (6.7 percent of total compensation) for management, professional and related occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Insurance benefit costs for private industry employers, by occupation, bargaining unit status, and industry, September 2010" border="1" height="514" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101213.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	In September 2010, the costs of insurance benefits were higher, both in amount and as a percentage of total compensation, for union workers ($4.84 or 12.8 percent of total compensation) than for nonunion workers ($1.94 or 7.3 percent of total compensation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The costs of insurance benefits per hour worked were higher in goods-producing industries ($3.11 or 9.5 percent of total compensation) than in service-providing industries ($2.05 or 7.6 percent of total compensation). Within goods-producing industries, insurance benefits costs averaged $2.34 per hour in construction and $3.40 per hour in manufacturing. Costs in service-providing industries varied from 67 cents in leisure and hospitality to $3.79 in the information industry.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chart: Employees required to add to their defined contribution retirement plans</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In March 2010, 63 percent of private sector workers were required to contribute to their employer-provided defined contribution retirement plans. This compares with 58 percent of state and local government workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Percent of employees in defined contribution plans who are required to contribute to their plans, March 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101214.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Among part-time workers, 56 percent who worked in private industry were required to contribute to their defined contribution plans, compared with 62 percent of those who worked in state and local government. For full-time workers, the percentages were the same as those for all workers, 63 percent in the private sector and 58 percent in state and local government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For unionized workers, 59 percent in private industry were required to contribute to their plans in March 2010, compared with 43 percent in state and local government; for nonunion workers, the figures were 63 and 66 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/"&gt;National Compensation Survey &amp;ndash; Benefits&lt;/a&gt; program.

            <title>Growing optimism in manufacturing as 49% plan to increase hiring in next six months</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Senior management at U.S. manufacturing companies is once again optimistic, according to a Grant Thornton LLP November survey. Nearly half (49 percent) believe the U.S. economy will improve in the next six months, and the same amount (49%) say they plan to increase staff during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing leaders are also optimistic about their own businesses, with 81% feeling optimistic about their companies&amp;rsquo; growth over the next six months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is consistent with what manufacturers are telling us as we are out in the marketplace talking with them&amp;rdquo; said Wally Gruenes, Grant Thornton&amp;rsquo;s national managing partner for Consumer and Industrial Products. &amp;ldquo;Despite reduced staffing levels and stricter customer mandates, manufacturers have improved their performance over the past three years in areas such as production cycle time, on-time delivery rate, scrap and rework, quality and warranty costs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In addition, the uncertainty surrounding some major concerns (tax rates, R&amp;amp;D credit extension, environmental standards, etc.) that paralyzed businesses over the past two years have been partially resolved, which sets the table for stable growth in manufacturing over the next two years. This, coupled with the highest level of cash on corporate balance sheets in over 50 years, bodes well for increased investment by the industry. In fact, 47% of manufacturers expect to increase purchases of capital equipment, 47% expect to embark upon process improvement initiatives and 37% expect to spend on information technology.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	The Grant Thornton Business Optimism Index, a quarterly survey of U.S. business leaders, comprises three measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;U.S. economy:&lt;/u&gt; Business leaders&amp;rsquo; perceptions of whether the U.S. economy will improve, remain the same or deteriorate in the next six months.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;Business growth:&lt;/u&gt; Business leaders&amp;rsquo; perceptions about the growth of their own businesses over the next six months.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;Hiring expectations:&lt;/u&gt; Whether business leaders expect the number of people their companies employ to increase, remain the same or decrease in the next six months.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>New Hampshire lost fewer manufacturing jobs over past year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in New Hampshire fell 2.6 percent over the past 12 months according to the 2011 New Hampshire Manufacturers Register, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;#39; News Inc. MNI reports New Hampshire lost 2,566 manufacturing jobs over the past year, a much smaller decline than the 5,509-job loss MNI reported over the 2008-2009 survey period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;#39; News reports New Hampshire is now home to 2,625 manufacturers employing 83,911 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;New Hampshire&amp;#39;s industrial sectors continue to be battered by the housing bust and the recession,&amp;quot; says Tom Dubin, president of the Evanston, Ill.-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912. &amp;quot;However, we&amp;#39;re definitely seeing fewer job losses than we did a year ago and the state&amp;#39;s educated workforce and business-friendly environment should help improve the outlook.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bright spots for the state included the expansion of chocolate maker Lindt in Stratham, which has opened up a new cocoa-processing facility; the expansion of Albany International Corporation&amp;#39;s Rochester plant; and the re-opening of a Fraser Papers&amp;#39; mill in Gorham after it was bought by MM Consulting and Contracting, saving 240 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI reports industrial machinery and equipment remains New Hampshire&amp;#39;s largest manufacturing sector by employment with 13,717 jobs, down 5.2 percent over the year, due partially to layoffs at Goss International. Second-ranked electronics manufacturing accounts for 13,656 jobs, down 1.4 percent over the year, while third-ranked fabricated metals accounts for 7,196 industrial jobs, down 5.4 percent, following the closure of Fisher Controls in Portsmouth, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most other sectors in New Hampshire lost jobs over the year and included paper products, down 16.1 percent; lumber/wood, down 14.7 percent; furniture/fixtures, down 13.8 percent; and rubber/plastics, down 9.2 percent, after the closures of Rexam Plastic Containers and Pretium Packaging Corp. among others. Printing/publishing declined 8.7 percent; transportation equipment was down 3.9 percent and food products was down 2.4 percent. Employment was steady in the chemicals and allied products sector, while textiles/apparel increased 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MNI&amp;#39;s city data shows Manchester is New Hampshire&amp;#39;s top city for manufacturing employment, with 8,470 jobs, down 5.6 percent over the year. Nashua ranks second with 5,287 industrial jobs, up 9.1 percent, while Hudson is home to 4,620 jobs, down 7.7 percent over the past 12 months. Londonderry accounts for 4,435 jobs, down 1.4 percent, and fifth-ranked Keene accounts for 3,385 industrial workers, 4 percent fewer than a year ago.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/SUOfDjIxj1w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>U.S. employees average nearly three weeks of sick days</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. workers took an average of 14 sick days in 2007 due to their own illness or injury, or to care for a sick child or other family member, according to the latest News and Numbers from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, employees took 10 days off because they were sick or injured and an additional 4 to care for family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The federal agency&amp;rsquo;s analysis also found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Workers ages 55 to 64 took an average of 18 days off of work, compared with 10 days for workers ages 16 to 24.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; About 38 percent of female workers missed work in 2007 for their own health problems, versus about 30 percent of male employees.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; Married women (24 percent) and married men (17 percent) aged 16-64 were more likely to miss work to care for a sick child or other family member, compared with unmarried women (14 percent) or unmarried men (7 percent).&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; Only 26 percent of uninsured employees took sick leave as compared to 36.5 percent of privately insured workers and 32 percent of people with Medicaid or other public insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AHRQ, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, improves the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. The data in this AHRQ News and Numbers summary are taken from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a detailed source of information on the health services used by Americans, the frequency with which they are used, the cost of those services, and how they are paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/ZxyH3bM89Vc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Managers have wrong assumptions about 'overqualified' job candidates</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Companies may want to give job candidates who are overqualified for positions a second look, according to a recent study by a Darla Moore School of Business researcher at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Anthony Nyberg&amp;rsquo;s study, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Psychology&lt;/i&gt; this fall, dispels the myth that overqualified job applicants are easily bored or prone to quit. Intelligent workers, the research indicates, benefit companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study was co-authored with Dr. Mark Maltarich, St. Ambrose University, and Dr. Greg Reilly, University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;A manager trying to fill a job that demands less-than-top-level smarts should never reject a candidate out of hand just because the applicant&amp;rsquo;s score on the company&amp;rsquo;s intelligence tests labels him or her as smarter than the job requires,&amp;rdquo; said Nyberg, an assistant professor of management and an expert in strategic human resources. &amp;ldquo;If anything, our research suggests that such a candidate could be expected to stay longer and perform better than an applicant whose scores make him supposedly a better fit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That may provide hope to millions out of work. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, unemployment reached 9.8 percent in November, meaning 15 million Americans are seeking employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The faulty and pervasive assumption among managers has been reinforced in the courts, Nyberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;To make matters worse, courts have upheld the legality of discriminating against applicants who are &amp;lsquo;too smart,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This kind of thinking has no doubt tossed more than a few layoff victims into the ranks of the long-term unemployed, a group that now constitutes nearly half of all U.S. jobless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nyberg&amp;rsquo;s findings are based on the analysis of more than 5,000 adults&amp;rsquo; labor-force behavior over a 25-year period in a nationwide U.S. sample. The data were taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He found that in positions with low cognitive demands, as defined by the federal government, which would include garbage collectors or car washers, employees with higher cognitive ability were less likely than others to voluntarily leave. Moreover, Nyberg said, in predicting job departure, the most mentally demanding jobs produced job dissatisfaction at three times the rate of the simplest jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nyberg said high-intelligence job candidates have many reasons for seeking a simple job. It could be for a lifestyle or health choice, an affinity for a company&amp;rsquo;s values or the simple need of earning a paycheck. He said rather than automatically rejecting an applicant who is overqualified, a hiring manager should probe to understand the applicant&amp;rsquo;s rationale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/IkGcURvj2vQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Manufacturers leverage lean transformation; employees emerge as top asset</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For decades, the U.S. economy has been driven by the manufacturing industry. A perennial global leader, there never appeared to be a reason to change the ways of doing business, until now. The U.S. manufacturing industry is amid a reinvention, implementing Lean Transformation as a strategy for growth, harnessing employee creativity and innovation as a key competitive advantage in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. manufacturers are joining the growing trend in changing their management strategies, realigning their organizations with a Lean culture that emphasizes continuous learning and value creation. The results are employees who feel more satisfied in their jobs and are contributing to innovative, creative solutions that are delivering greater value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three executive manufacturing leaders will share their Lean Transformation case studies with a crowd of 150-plus, fellow executives at an upcoming &amp;ldquo;Profiles of a Lean Transformation&amp;rdquo; seminar, hosted by Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center, on December 14, at Whitemarsh Valley Country Club in Lafayette Hill, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The United States represents less than 5% of the global population. Our ability to compete, create jobs and protect our quality of life will be through the quality and ingenuity of our people.&amp;rdquo; says Mark Basla, vice president of marketing and business development for DVIRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DVIRC is a leading private, non-profit economic development organization established in 1988 to serve the needs of nearly 5,000 small to mid-sized advanced manufacturing Enterprises (SME) in five counties throughout the Philadelphia region. The organization&amp;rsquo;s primary focus is to grow business value for clients through consulting services, talent development and regional, state and federal resource assistance, helping to establish the region as an internationally recognized leader in manufacturing competitiveness. We believe growing business value improves the standard of living and quality of life for those that live and/or work in the region. A diverse board of directors comprised of executives from the manufacturing, banking, legal and economic development communities govern the DVIRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/FIi_-Hhki_s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>67% of employers report a bad hire affected their business in past year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As companies prepare their recruitment plans for 2011, avoiding bad hires will be a priority. With unemployment hovering around 9.5 percent, the job market is flooded with qualified candidates. Yet even with all the top talent available, time pressures, strained resources and a lack of insight into target talent have been a challenge to employers to find the right people for their open positions. Two-in-three (67 percent) companies report that a bad hire has adversely affected their business in the last year. Poor hires can be costly too, as nearly one-in-four hiring managers (24 percent) said one bad hire cost their business more than $50,000 in the last year. Four-in-ten said that one bad hire cost them more than $25,000. The nationwide survey was conducted among more than 2,400 employers between August 17 and September 2, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When asked how a poor hire affected their business in the last year, employers reported the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lost time to recruit and train another worker &amp;ndash; 39 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Less productivity &amp;ndash; 38 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Lost money to recruit and train another worker &amp;ndash; 37 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Had a negative effect on employee morale &amp;ndash; 30 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Had a negative effect on client relations &amp;ndash; 21 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fewer sales &amp;ndash; 11 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Legal issues &amp;ndash; 9 percent
		&lt;p&gt;
			&amp;ldquo;Among other things, hiring the wrong talent for a position can have a significant effect on an employer&amp;rsquo;s bottom line,&amp;rdquo; said Jamie Womack, vice president of corporate marketing for CareerBuilder. &amp;ldquo;To help proactively prevent bad hires, and their impact on the business, employers are exploring new ways to leverage target talent data and research in their hiring process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Of employers who made a bad hire, 36 percent said they think they made a mistake hiring someone because they needed to fill the job quickly, followed by lack of understanding of where their target talent is (20 percent) and unsuccessful sourcing techniques (9 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Understanding who target talent is and how they will fit into an organization is increasingly important as hiring costs increase. Fifty-eight percent of employers have an average cost per hire of more than $1,000, up from 29 percent in 2008. Nearly one-in-10 (9 percent) estimate their cost-per-hire at more than $10,000. Specialized areas that are experiencing a shortage of qualified talent are reporting even higher recruitment expenses. Eighty percent of IT employers said it costs them in excess of $1,000 to fill an open position. Sixty-six percent of health care employers said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Study: Few long-term psychological effects after job loss</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Losing a job is a profoundly distressing experience, but the unemployed may be more resilient than previously believed &amp;ndash; the vast majority eventually end up as satisfied with life as they were before they lost their jobs, according to a new analysis published by the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Unemployment rates continue to be historically high in the United States and other countries,&amp;rdquo; said the study&amp;rsquo;s lead author, Isaac Galatzer-Levy, PhD, who is now at New York University School of Medicine. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a real concern that this will have long-term implications on the mental well-being of a large portion of the work force. But this analysis suggests that people are able to cope with a job loss relatively well over time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Galatzer-Levy and his colleagues analyzed results of the German Socioeconomic Panel Data study. This is a nationally representative survey of German households conducted yearly from 1984 to 2003. Their findings are published in the latest issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology and Economics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this analysis, the researchers used data from 774 participants who had all lost their jobs at some point during the study. Included in this analysis were the participants&amp;rsquo; own reports of well-being in the three years before they lost their jobs until four years after the job loss. Specifically, they were asked, &amp;ldquo;How satisfied are you nowadays with your life as a whole?&amp;rdquo; Respondents rated this question on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being completely satisfied. They were also asked about their sex, age, education and employment status. The researchers also gathered national and regional unemployment rates during the time of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Because we used a large representative sample, unemployment follows broad economic trends in Germany,&amp;rdquo; said Galatzer-Levy. &amp;ldquo;Just like in the current climate, these are people who are losing jobs not due to fault of their own, but because they&amp;rsquo;re the victims of large market forces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The researchers divided the participants into four groups based on their life satisfaction reports. The largest group (69 percent) reported a relatively high and stable level of life satisfaction before losing their jobs. These people were more likely to be negatively affected at the time they lost their jobs but a year later, their average life satisfaction had returned to its pre-unemployment level. The researchers also observed that people in this group were no more or less likely to regain employment by the end of the study.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For the second largest group, 15 percent of respondents, their well-being was gradually improving before losing their jobs and then leveled off in the four years following their unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another group (13 percent) reported relatively low levels of life satisfaction before job loss, and their levels stayed more or less the same throughout the time of the researchers&amp;rsquo; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well-being levels among the smallest group (4 percent) were already declining in the years leading up to unemployment and continued to decline after job loss until it began to go back up in the third year. But these people never fully returned to pre-unemployment levels, according to the findings. This last group was also the least likely to be re-employed in the years after they lost their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Previous analysis of this same data suggested that people never really returned to pre-unemployment levels of life satisfaction. Using a different analytical model, we are able to identify these distinct patterns that are more representative of people&amp;rsquo;s different responses to unemployment,&amp;rdquo; said Galatzer-Levy. &amp;ldquo;Our model suggests responses to unemployment do not represent a unified phenomenon as previously believed. In fact, most people cope well with this event and report few long-term effects on their overall well-being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The findings are quite similar to a pattern of resilience psychologists see across a wide range of stressful events, according to the study&amp;rsquo;s co-author, George Bonanno, PhD, a psychology professor at Columbia University. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;#39;ve looked at other traumatic events such as the death of a loved one, terrorist attack, traumatic injury, and we generally always see high proportions of resilience. This is one of the first studies to show that this same pattern relates to unemployment,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Furthermore, they found that broad economic patterns have a strong effect on people&amp;rsquo;s sense of well-being before but not during unemployment. Also, people seemed to be more negatively affected by regional unemployment rates than national unemployment rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This suggests that people are more stressed out when they fear losing their jobs than they are when they actually get laid off,&amp;rdquo; said Bonanno. &amp;ldquo;When massive job layoffs come closer to home and are observed in their communities, people are more likely to feel they are next and their well-being drops significantly as a result.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>USW members ratify labor deal for AK Steel's Mansfield Works</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel said December 9 that members of the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 169 have ratified a three-year extension to a labor agreement covering about 270 hourly production and maintenance employees at the company&amp;rsquo;s Mansfield (Ohio) Works. The new agreement extends the existing contract to March 31, 2014. The existing contract was scheduled to expire March 31, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel said it was notified by USW officials that the contract extension passed in voting held today in Mansfield. The terms of the extension are effective as of December 3, 2010.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The contract extension provides lump sum payments of $1,000 to each represented employee covered by the contract in 2010 and 2012. In addition, the standard hourly wage rates will be increased by $0.50 in April of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are pleased to have reached an early agreement on this contract extension which provides AK Steel with continued operational flexibility for our Mansfield Works, as well as a wage increase and other economic benefits for our hourly employees at that plant,&amp;rdquo; said James L. Wainscott, chairman, president and CEO of AK Steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About AK Steel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	AK Steel produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels, primarily for automotive, appliance, construction and electrical power generation and distribution markets.

            <title>DOL grant to assist Wisconsin workers impacted by layoffs at Chrysler engine plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Labor on December 9 announced a $2,601,207 grant to assist about 448 workers affected by the closure of the Chrysler Kenosha Engine Plant located in Kenosha, Wis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Labor Department is committed to helping all workers who have lost jobs through no fault of their own &amp;ndash; including those in the nation&amp;#39;s auto communities,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;Helping these workers in Wisconsin get back on a career path is good for working families, local communities and the economy as a whole. It makes sense and it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Awarded to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, this grant will be operated by the Southeast Wisconsin Workforce Development Board. The grant will provide these dislocated workers, all of whom are also certified as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance, with access to &amp;quot;wrap-around&amp;quot; and other supportive services not available through the TAA program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In August, Chrysler issued a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice announcing the permanent closure of its engine manufacturing facility in Kenosha. The plant closed in October, ending more than 100 years of auto industry employment in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the $2,601,207 announced on December 9, $1,207,576 will be released initially. Additional funding up to the amount approved will be made available as the state demonstrates a continued need for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	National Emergency Grants are awarded at the discretion of the secretary of labor based on a state&amp;#39;s ability to meet specific guidelines.

            <title>Chart: Job openings, hires and separations rates by month since November 2007</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There were 3.4 million job openings on the last business day of October &amp;mdash; the highest since August 2008. The job openings rate increased over the month from 2.3 to 2.5 percent; in October 2009, it was 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Job openings rate, total nonfarm, seasonally adjusted, November 2007-October 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101209a.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	In October, the hires rate remained at 3.2 percent for total non-farm and the rate was essentially unchanged for all industries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Hires and separations rates, seasonally adjusted, November 2007-October 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101209b.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The total separations, or turnover, rate in October was little changed, at 3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/jlt/"&gt;Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey&lt;/a&gt; and are seasonally adjusted. Data for October 2010 is preliminary and subject to revision. For more information, see &amp;quot;Job Openings and Labor Turnover &amp;mdash; October 2010&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_12072010.htm"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_12072010.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), new release USDL-10-1685. Total separations includes quits (voluntary separations), layoffs and discharges (involuntary separations), and other separations (including retirements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/IZ0vZykqQaw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Poll shows companies giving more holiday parties and perks this year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The economic scrooge may be loosening its grip on holiday cheer in the office as employers indicate their intent to offer more holiday perks (bonuses, parties, gifts) than last year. The nationwide &lt;a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleases.aspx"&gt;CareerBuilder survey&lt;/a&gt; was conducted between August 17 and September 2, 2010 and included more than 3,600 workers and more than 2,600 employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bonuses:&lt;/strong&gt; A third (33 percent) of employers plan to give their employees holiday bonuses this year,&lt;a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr540&amp;amp;sd=12%2f10%2f2009&amp;amp;ed=12%2f31%2f2009&amp;amp;siteid=cbpr&amp;amp;sc_cmp1=cb_pr540_"&gt;up from 29 percent in 2009.&lt;/a&gt; Among that group, 59 percent are planning to give the same amount as in previous years. Nine percent of employers say they will not be issuing holiday bonuses even though they have in previous years, &lt;a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr540&amp;amp;sd=12%2f10%2f2009&amp;amp;ed=12%2f31%2f2009&amp;amp;siteid=cbpr&amp;amp;sc_cmp1=cb_pr540_"&gt;down from 12 percent last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Parties: &lt;/strong&gt;More than half (52 percent) of employers are planning a holiday party for their employees this year, up from 49 percent in 2009. Of that group, 70 percent plan to throw the same party as in previous years. Eight percent (down from 11 percent last year) of employers don&amp;rsquo;t plan to have a holiday party in 2010 even though they have in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Gifts: &lt;/strong&gt;Close to three-in-10 (29 percent) employers plan to give holiday gifts, up from 26 percent in 2009. Among those giving gifts, sixty-five percent plan to spend the same amount for workers as in previous years. Six percent say they are not planning to give holidays gifts in 2010, even though they have in years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Many employers are financially in a better place this season and recognize the positive impact holiday perks can have on office morale,&amp;rdquo; said Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources for CareerBuilder. &amp;ldquo;Companies are not only giving back to employees this holiday season, 45 percent say their charitable donations will be the same or more than previous years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Holiday perks in the office aren&amp;rsquo;t just from corporate; a quarter of workers say they plan to buy holiday gifts for co-workers this year, compared to 22 percent who plan to buy their boss a gift. The majority (86 percent) of workers buying gifts say they plan to spend $25 or less on average for each holiday gift they buy for the office. Workers said the most unusual gifts they received from co-workers included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		bag of ice&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a bra&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a CD he recorded of himself singing (badly)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a dickie&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a unicorn&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a statue of Dracula&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a sweater turtleneck covered in piranhas&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		a used cookbook&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		coupon to a strip club&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		pack of toilet paper (20 rolls)&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Initial U.S. jobless claims declined by 17,000 last week</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the week ending December 4, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims was 421,000, a decrease of 17,000 from the previous week&amp;#39;s revised figure of 438,000, the U.S. Department of Labor reported on December 9. The four-week moving average was 427,500, a decrease of 4,000 from the previous week&amp;#39;s revised average of 431,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advance seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate was 3.2 percent for the week ending November 27, a decrease of 0.2 percentage point from the prior week&amp;#39;s unrevised rate of 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advance number for seasonally adjusted insured unemployment during the week ending November 27 was 4,086,000, a decrease of 191,000 from the preceding week&amp;#39;s revised level of 4,277,000. The four-week moving average was 4,226,000, a decrease of 64,250 from the preceding week&amp;#39;s revised average of 4,290,250.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Unadjusted data: &lt;/strong&gt;The advance number of actual initial claims under state programs, unadjusted, totaled 582,007 in the week ending December 4, an increase of 169,085 from the previous week. There were 665,685 initial claims in the comparable week in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advance unadjusted insured unemployment rate was 3.3 percent during the week ending November 27, an increase of 0.4 percentage point from the prior week. The advance unadjusted number for persons claiming unemployment insurance benefits in state programs totaled 4,188,560, an increase of 522,787 from the preceding week. A year earlier, the rate was 4.1 percent and the volume was 5,400,752.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending November 13 was 8,297,938.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extended benefits were available in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin, during the week ending November 20.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Private industry employer compensation costs averaged $27.88 per hour worked</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	State and local government employers spent an average of $26.25 per hour worked for employee wages and salaries in September 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 8. Wages and salaries accounted for 65.5 percent of compensation costs while benefits averaged $13.85 per hour worked and accounted for the remaining 34.5 percent. Wages and salaries for management, professional and related occupations, which represent approximately half of all state and local government employment, averaged $33.17 per hour worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC), a product of the National Compensation Survey, measures employer costs for wages, salaries and employee benefits for non-farm private and state and local government workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Health benefit employer costs in September 2010 were $4.65 per hour worked for state and local government and $2.10 in private industry. Defined benefit retirement plan costs for state and local government employers were $2.94 per hour worked, significantly higher than 44 cents for private industry employers. Defined contribution retirement costs were 32 cents per hour worked for state and local government and 55 cents for private industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civilian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Civilian employer costs averaged $2.63 per hour worked for insurance benefits (life, health and disability insurance) or 8.8 percent of total compensation. In addition to insurance, the other benefit categories were: paid leave (vacation, holiday, sick leave and personal leave), which averaged $2.05 (6.9 percent of total compensation); supplemental pay (overtime and premium, shift differentials and non-production bonuses), which averaged 71 cents per hour worked (2.4 percent); retirement and savings (defined benefit and defined contribution), which averaged $1.34 per hour (4.5 percent of total compensation); and legally required benefits (Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and workers&amp;rsquo; compensation), which averaged $2.32 per hour worked (7.8 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Private industry employer compensation costs averaged $27.88 per hour worked. Private industry employer wages and salaries averaged $19.68 per hour (70.6 percent of total compensation), while benefits averaged $8.20 (29.4 percent). Employer costs for paid leave averaged $1.88 per hour worked (6.7 percent), supplemental pay averaged 78 cents (2.8 percent), insurance benefits averaged $2.24 (8.0 percent), retirement and savings averaged 99 cents (3.6 percent) and legally required benefits averaged $2.31 (8.3 percent) per hour worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compensation costs in state and local government&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	State and local government compensation costs averaged $40.10 per hour worked. Wages and salaries averaged $26.25 per hour (65.5 percent of total compensation), while benefits averaged $13.85 (34.5 percent). Among state and local government employees, average hourly compensation costs were higher for management, professional and related occupations ($48.73) than for service occupations ($30.17) and sales and office occupations ($27.87).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For state and local government employees, employer costs for insurance benefits were $4.80 per hour, or 12.0 percent of total compensation. The largest component of insurance costs was health insurance, which averaged $4.65, or 11.6 percent of total compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In September 2010, the average cost for retirement and savings benefits was $3.26 per hour worked in state and local government (8.1 percent of total compensation). Included in this amount were employer costs for defined benefit plans, which averaged $2.94 per hour (7.3 percent) and defined contribution plans, which averaged 32 cents (0.8 percent). Defined benefit plans specify a formula for determining future benefits, while defined contribution plans specify employer contributions but do not guarantee the amount of future benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two major components of benefit costs are paid leave and legally required benefits. Paid leave benefit costs include vacation, holiday, sick leave and personal leave. The average cost for paid leave was $3.03 per hour worked for state and local government employees. Costs for legally required benefits, including Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance (both state and federal) and workers&amp;rsquo; compensation, averaged $2.42 per hour worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/cMc9y2-VzBU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Number of persons experiencing unemployment in 2009 rose 4.9 million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A total of 153.9 million persons worked at some point during 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 8. The proportion of workers who worked full time, year round in 2009 was 64.0 percent, down from 65.6 percent in 2008. The number of persons who experienced some unemployment during 2009 increased by 4.9 million to 26.1 million. The sharp increase reflects the continuing weak labor market conditions experienced throughout 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These data are based on information collected in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a monthly survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The ASEC collects information on employment and unemployment experienced during the prior calendar year. Highlights from the 2009 data include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The proportion of the civilian non-institutional population age 16 and over who worked at some time during 2009 was 64.9 percent, down from 67.0 percent in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The &amp;quot;work-experience unemployment rate&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; defined as the number of persons unemployed at some time during the year as a proportion of the number of persons who worked or looked for work during the year &amp;ndash; was 16.4 percent in 2009, up from 13.2 percent in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The number of individuals who looked for a job but did not work at all during 2009 increased by 2.7 million over the year to 5.8 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persons with Employment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The percent of men who worked during 2009 was 70.6 percent, down from 73.1 percent in 2008. The proportion of women who worked at some point during 2009 was 59.6 percent, down from 61.3 percent in the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proportions of whites (65.8 percent), blacks (58.8 percent), Asians (65.2 percent) and Hispanics (65.0 percent) who worked at some time during the year fell in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among those with work experience during 2009, 75.3 percent were employed year round (working 50 to 52 weeks, either full or part time), down from 76.1 percent in 2008. The percentage of women working year round rose by 0.8 percentage point to 75.1 percent in 2009, and the percentage of men employed year round fell by 2.2 percentage points to 75.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of those employed at some time during 2009, 78.3 percent usually worked full time, down from 79.5 percent in 2008. Men were more likely to work full time during the year (84.4 percent) than were women (71.5 percent). In 2009, the proportions of employed men and women working full time declined by 1.6 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persons with Unemployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	About 159.8 million persons worked or looked for work at some time in 2009. Of those, 26.1 million experienced some unemployment during the year, up from 21.2 million in 2008. Men accounted for the majority of the over-the-year increase in unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At 16.4 percent in 2009, the &amp;quot;work-experience unemployment rate&amp;quot; (those looking for work during the year as a percent of those who worked or looked for work during the year) was 3.2 percentage points higher than in 2008. The 2009 rate was the highest since 1985. The rates for whites (15.5 percent), blacks (22.4 percent), Hispanics (20.9 percent) and Asians (12.6 percent) rose in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, men continued to have higher &amp;quot;work-experience unemployment rates&amp;quot; in 2009 than women, 18.8 vs. 13.6 percent. Among whites, the rate for men (18.1 percent) was higher than that for women (12.6 percent). This also was the case for men and women among blacks (26.1 and 19.1 percent, respectively) and Hispanics (23.7 and 16.9 percent, respectively.) The rates for Asian men (12.4 percent) and Asian women (12.8 percent) were little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among those who experienced unemployment in 2009, the median number of weeks spent looking for work was 19.7, up from 15.2 in 2008. The number of individuals who looked for a job but did not work at all increased by 2.7 million to about 5.8 million individuals in 2009. Of the 20.3 million persons who worked during 2009 and also experienced unemployment, 20.5 percent had 2 or more spells of joblessness, down from 22.1 percent in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/V2A7JN4UyMU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Company holiday parties on the rise, but many are keeping festivities low key</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As a growing number of companies benefit from a slowly improving economy, there are indications that workplace holiday parties are starting to make a comeback. However, with the bitter taste of cost-cutting measures still fresh in employees&amp;rsquo; minds, some companies appear to be keeping festivities relatively subdued, according to a new survey and interviews with employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In its annual survey on holiday parties, global outplacement and business coaching firm Challenger, Gray &amp;amp; Christmas Inc. found that 64 percent of companies are planning holiday parties this year, up slightly from 62 percent a year ago. About 4 percent of those holding parties this year are doing so after one or more years with no party due to the recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The non-scientific survey of approximately 100 human resources professionals found that only 6 percent of those companies holding parties are planning to spend more this year. The majority of respondents (76 percent) said party budgets would be about the same as last year. Eighteen percent of companies are spending less, down from 29 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are at a precarious stage in the recovery, where some companies are feeling it more than others. Many companies are still struggling. The corporate holiday party scene is going to vary greatly across the country and in different industries. New York City, in general, is rebounding faster than many other major cities, so parties there might be pretty extravagant. Tech companies on the West Coast are also doing well. But, overall, we are probably still a year or more away from a widespread return to the types of festivities held prior to the recession,&amp;rdquo; said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray &amp;amp; Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In interviews with human resource professionals, Challenger found that some companies are still feeling the effects of the recession. Several indicated that they are still having parties, but noted that the parties would be fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to justify the expense of a party when we are fighting to keep people&amp;rsquo;s jobs,&amp;rdquo; said a human resources executive from a New York-based consumer products company, which is still planning to have a party but budgeting less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This year, it will be in-house; a catered lunch with no alcohol. In the past, we had an offsite event with food and full bar,&amp;rdquo; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A Michigan automotive parts manufacturer also plans to go ahead with a holiday party, but like last year, its event will be scaled down from pre-recession levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Prior to last year, we held an annual Christmas party off site for employees and spouses. Last year, we eliminated that and went to holding an employee lunch,&amp;rdquo; said a human resources representative of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interestingly, the Michigan company, along with some others, found that the scaled-back parties ended up being preferred by employees. &amp;ldquo;The employee lunch was well received and involved more of the employees than usual.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A human resources executive from an East Coast animal health products company observed, &amp;ldquo;We scaled back holiday party in 2008 from an off-site event at an upscale restaurant to a more modest catered event at our own facility. Office is tastefully decorated and large hallway spaces are set up for conversations. Feedback is that this more simple approach is less intense and enables people to more easily connect and converse with one another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About 53 percent of companies having holiday parties are holding them on company premises. That is up from 29 percent in 2009. Nearly half (47 percent) are holding their events during or near the end of the workday and the majority (54 percent) are open to employees only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that some companies found that scaled back parties are actually preferred by employees. There is a common perception that corporate holiday parties are raucous affairs where managers and their workers can cut loose. In reality, however, corporate parties can merely add another layer of stress to workers, who have to worry about getting too relaxed and saying or doing something that might offend a supervisor,&amp;rdquo; said Challenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Some employees would just as soon skip the holiday party in favor of an extra paid vacation day or a little extra money in their year-end paycheck,&amp;rdquo; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is exactly what one company interviewed by Challenger decided to do this year. After holding a half-day catered party last year, the North American unit of a Swedish industrial products manufacturer decided to replace the party this year with $100 gift cards for each employee along with a half-day to go shopping. For the company, it was not a cost-saving measure, but simply a way to help its employees with holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While some employers are keeping events subdued, Challenger does see evidence that holiday parties are beginning to make a rebound. Energy XXI, a Houston-based oil &amp;amp; natural gas exploration and production company, has had a strong year and wants to celebrate its success with all of its employees. The company is budgeting twice as much as last year for its holiday party, using an event planner and holding it an outside venue. In the Chicago area, Teri Belgio of Naperville-based Belgio&amp;rsquo;s Catering noted in an e-mail that they have seen an increase in inquiries for the upcoming party season. While most of the caterer&amp;rsquo;s orders come in shortly after Thanksgiving, she said that people are indicating they are having parties again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;For workers whose companies are holding parties this year, it is important to remember that there is a fine line between having fun and having too much fun. The economic recovery is still very fragile, so it is not the time to draw attention to oneself with embarrassing conduct at the holiday party,&amp;rdquo; said Challenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;However, employees should not simply stand in the corner in an effort to stay off the radar. It is equally important to remember that these events also offer great opportunities, such as socializing with senior executives who you do not interact with on a daily basis. Make an effort to break away from your comfort zone and introduce yourself to those who might help your career,&amp;rdquo; he advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GUIDELINES FOR OFFICE HOLIDAY PARTYGOERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Arrive early: &lt;/strong&gt;This might be your best opportunity to talk with senior executives while things are still relatively quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Work the room: &lt;/strong&gt;It is easy to simply socialize with the members of your department, with whom you work with day in and day out. However, you gain if you use this occasion to meet people in other departments. You never know who can help your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Do not over indulge: &lt;/strong&gt;Free alcohol can quickly lead to excessive drinking. Stay in control. You do not want to do anything embarrassing to you or your employer. Even if your alcohol-induced actions do not get you fired, they could hurt your chances for advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Be friendly, but not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;friendly: &lt;/strong&gt;The company party is not the place to try out your latest pick-up lines. The risk of such behavior being seen as sexual harassment is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Avoid talking business: &lt;/strong&gt;This is not the time to approach your boss with a new business idea. Save that for Monday morning. Instead, find out about his or her interests outside of the office. Find a connection on a personal level. That connection will help you on Monday when you bring up the new idea and it could help when it comes time for salary reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Attend other companies&amp;rsquo; parties: &lt;/strong&gt;Fifty-four percent of company parties are employees only. If a friend invites you to his or her company party, you should go. It is an opportunity to expand your professional network, which is critical in this era of downsizing and job switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/upmgf5TerDM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Virtual teams really are different: 6 lessons for creating successful ones</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Consider this:The office of the future might not be an office at all. As virtual teams become more prevalent, we edge ever closer to a culture where &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; means logging in to your company&amp;#39;s online project management site from your home or collaborating with people who each work for different teams or functions at their local co-working establishment. &amp;quot;Company headquarters&amp;quot; is becoming more of a concept than an actual building. And as physical location becomes less important, companies can hire the best talent regardless of their location. In addition, companies can enhance their efficiency by handing off work across time zones, enabling them to be productive around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But far too often, say Darleen DeRosa and Rick Lepsinger, this vision of the global economy workplace falls short of today&amp;#39;s reality. In other words, virtual teams may be increasingly popular...but they&amp;#39;re not necessarily successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Today it isn&amp;#39;t uncommon for companies to have as many as 50 percent of their employees working on virtual teams,&amp;quot; says Lepsinger, coauthor along with Darleen DeRosa of &lt;em&gt;Virtual Team Success: A Practical Guide for Working and Leading from a Distance &lt;/em&gt;(Jossey-Bass/A Wiley Imprint, 2010, ISBN: 978-0-470-53296-6, $50.00, &lt;a href="http://www.mmsend2.com/link.cfm?r=25150338&amp;amp;sid=11576296&amp;amp;m=1179070&amp;amp;u=RocksPR&amp;amp;s=http://www.onpointconsultingllc.com/"&gt;www.onpointconsultingllc.com&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not hard to see why. Advances in technology have made it easier to organize and manage dispersed groups of people. And competitive pressures and the needs of today&amp;#39;s global market workforce have made virtual teams a necessity for some organizations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, explain the authors, having solid business reasons for implementing a virtual strategy does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that strategy is always going to be executed well. The problem is that too many companies treat their virtual teams the same way they treat teams that share the same physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our research finds that many organizations recycle the same guidelines and best practices they use for their co-located teams and hope for the best,&amp;quot; says DeRosa. &amp;quot;Frankly, that just doesn&amp;#39;t work. Virtual teams and face-to-face teams are the proverbial &amp;#39;apples and oranges&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; and leaders who recognize this fact are the ones whose teams succeed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help organizations maximize their investment in virtual collaboration, OnPoint Consulting conducted a study of forty-eight virtual teams to understand the success factors of top performing virtual teams. Surprisingly, 27 percent of virtual teams in the global study were not fully performing. Given these results, the authors recognized the need for a resource that could help organizations and leaders enhance virtual team performance &amp;ndash; and so they wrote &lt;em&gt;Virtual Team Success&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the study, the authors recognized that virtual teams regularly fall victim to four pitfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Lack of clear goals, direction, or priorities &amp;ndash; &lt;/em&gt;Because it is tougher to communicate with and inform team members who are geographically dispersed, it is often difficult to keep all team members focused on the same goals, especially over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Lack of clear roles among team members&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; In virtual teams, it is especially important for team members to clearly understand their individual roles and how their work impacts other team members.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Lack of cooperation and trust&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Because there is a lack of face-to-face contact inherent in virtual teamwork, the process of establishing trust and relationships that lead to group cooperation can be very arduous. Over time, this lack of collaboration can lead to a lack of trust amongst team members.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Lack of engagement&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; With virtual teams, people can easily become bored and &amp;quot;check out&amp;quot; because there is a lack of dynamic face-to-face interaction and because there are more distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eliminate these pitfalls and a team&amp;#39;s chances for success greatly increase. Below DeRosa and Lepsinger identify six lessons &amp;ndash; excerpted from the book &amp;ndash; for creating successful virtual teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 1: Focus on people issues. &lt;/strong&gt;Essentially, successful teaming depends largely on the effective interaction of team members. Virtual teams need to compensate for the inherent lack of human contact by supporting team spirit, trust, and productivity. The authors identify warning signs that indicate that a team&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;people issues&amp;quot; need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;You may notice that team members work independently and do not reach out to other team members to collaborate,&amp;quot; says Lepsinger. &amp;quot;You may also notice that an &amp;#39;us versus them&amp;#39; mentality has developed between locations or sub-groups. The truth is, when everyone is engaged and communicating, it is much easier to succeed as a virtual team. When team members build relationships with one another, it prevents people issues from taking over and impacting team efficiency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 1 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a team web page where virtual team members can share information and get to know one another.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create ways for team members to interact and communicate informally. Use real-time communication tools like Instant Messaging or social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter to create a virtual water cooler of sorts that allows people on virtual teams to communicate more spontaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Build a collective online &amp;quot;resource bank&amp;quot; to share information and experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Find ways to &amp;quot;spotlight&amp;quot; team members.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Send electronic newsletters or updates to the team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create ways to virtually celebrate successes as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Partner team members at different locations on projects and rotate these periodically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 2: No trust, no team. &lt;/strong&gt;Task-based trust is one of the factors that differentiated top performing teams. In virtual teams trust seems to develop more readily at the task level than at the interpersonal level. There are four warning signs that trust is in low supply in virtual teams: 1) team members do not refer to themselves as &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;; 2) they do not appear to know one another very well; 3) they are openly negative; and 4) they do not regard others as credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;If you want trust to develop among your team members, you have to set the foundation,&amp;quot; says DeRosa. &amp;quot;It doesn&amp;#39;t simply develop because a team has been working together for a while.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 2 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make sure teams meet face-to-face at least once early on in the team&amp;#39;s formation. Spend some part of the meeting focused on building relationships and learning about team members&amp;#39; capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure team members feel empowered to make and act on decisions. Because virtual leaders do not have &amp;quot;face time&amp;quot; with team members to check in, leaders are more likely to micromanage team members without realizing it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Help people manage conflicts, not avoid them. Conflict is likely to be ignored or may escalate quickly in a virtual setting. Therefore, leaders need to more proactively manage conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The team leader should model and reinforce these positive behaviors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 3: &amp;quot;Soft&amp;quot; skills are essential. &lt;/strong&gt;The presence of &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; skills makes a difference in virtual team performance. Lepsinger and DeRosa found that virtual teams that have been through team-building and interpersonal skill development activities perform better than those that have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Despite the strong link between training and virtual team performance, many organizations do not make this investment,&amp;quot; notes Lepsinger. &amp;quot;Another all-too-common practice is selecting team members based solely on their technical skills without considering key attributes like their interpersonal skills. The obvious solution is to include characteristics like effective communication and collaboration in the selection criteria.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 3 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use criteria and/or assessments when selecting individuals for virtual teams.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use team-building sessions &amp;ndash; ideally conducted at an initial or subsequent face-to-face team meeting &amp;ndash; to help team members strengthen working relationships and create team momentum that can enhance team effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Assess development needs for team members and team leaders and conduct skill-building focused on these areas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reassess needs over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 4: Watch out for performance peaks. &lt;/strong&gt;While virtual teams who have been working together for more than three years tend to be more successful than teams working together for less time, many virtual teams face a performance peak around the one-year mark. After that, performance tends to level off or even decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;High-performing virtual teams avoid this problem by implementing strategies to overcome this peak,&amp;quot; explains DeRosa. &amp;quot;When you see the warning signs of stagnant performance &amp;ndash; team members get along well but do not produce results, there&amp;#39;s an apparent lack of direction, or team members don&amp;#39;t commit adequate time to the team &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;s time to take action.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 4 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Clearly define team roles and accountabilities to minimize frustration and misunderstandings that can damage morale and derail productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review and refine team processes regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Periodically examine the level of team performance. Collect feedback from various stakeholders to assess the team&amp;#39;s performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Based on the outcomes, identify barriers to high performance, as well as steps that can be taken to overcome these barriers.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 5: Create a &amp;quot;high touch&amp;quot; environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Electronic technology has made virtual teaming possible, but it is not a perfect substitute for human interaction. One of the greatest performance barriers is the inability to replicate a high touch environment in a virtual setting. That&amp;#39;s why, in addition to figuring out ways to make virtual interaction more &amp;quot;human,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s critical that companies arrange for their virtual team members to meet in person at least once a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Yes, they require time and expense, but virtual teams that invest in one or two such meetings per year perform better overall than those that do not,&amp;quot; says Lepsinger. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll know you haven&amp;#39;t achieved a high touch environment with your virtual team if they communicate poorly, aren&amp;#39;t fully engaged, and don&amp;#39;t pay attention during virtual meetings.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 5 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leverage synchronous tools (e.g., Instant Messaging) to increase spontaneous communication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use tools such as electronic bulletin boards to create a sense of shared space.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Carefully choose communication technologies that are most appropriate to the specific task. For instance, email is good for simple information sharing, while conference calls are better suited for interactive sharing of ideas or plans.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Make wider use of videoconferencing. &amp;quot;Our survey data suggests that teams that use video technology perform better in general than those that do not,&amp;quot; says Lepsinger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 6: Virtual team leadership matters. &lt;/strong&gt;Leadership is the factor most important to the success of virtual teams. OnPoint&amp;#39;s study and other research shows that leadership does, in fact, have a statistically significant correlation with higher performance on virtual teams. To overcome the limitations of distance and to be fully effective, team leaders in a virtual environment must be especially sensitive to interpersonal communication and cultural factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are four key warning signs that a team leader is not up to snuff: 1) the team is not meeting its performance objectives, and deliverables are delayed or of poor quality; 2) relationships between the team members and the leader aren&amp;#39;t strong; 3) the leader is not clear about the team&amp;#39;s direction or purpose; and 4) the team leader pays more attention to team members who are at his/her location or whom he/she gets along with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Organizations can avoid this performance barrier by selecting team leaders who not only have the necessary technical skills but also have the soft skills required to effectively lead in a virtual environment,&amp;quot; says DeRosa. &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re a team leader, it&amp;#39;s not easy to learn that you may be the cause of your team&amp;#39;s poor performance. But there are many ways to improve your performance and get your team back on track.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lesson No. 6 in Action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Set clear goals and direction and revisit these as priorities shift.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Engage team members in the development of team strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide time for team building through periodic face-to-face meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provide timely feedback to team members. Be responsive and accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Emphasize common interests and values and reinforce cooperation and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Create a system to easily integrate new team members.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Teach the importance of conflict resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Celebrate team achievements and successes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve seen too many well-intentioned companies fail because they treated their virtual teams the same way they treat their co-located teams,&amp;quot; says Lepsinger. &amp;quot;And then there are the organizations that start virtual teams in response to an opportunity or problem without planning or proper follow-up &amp;ndash; never a recipe for success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Organizations frequently set up virtual teams to address a particular business need,&amp;quot; concludes DeRosa. &amp;quot;However, they jump in without really understanding what they are getting themselves into. Simply put, better planning could dramatically improve their odds for success. Now, there is a formula for success. All today&amp;#39;s virtual teams must do is put it to work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. job openings rate increased to 2.5%</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There were 3.4 million job openings on the last business day of October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 7. The job openings rate increased over the month to 2.5 percent. The hires rate remained at 3.2 percent in October, while the separations rate was essentially unchanged at 3.1 percent. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires and separations for the total non-farm sector by industry and geographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Openings &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The number of job openings in October was 3.4 million, which was up from 3.0 million in September. Since the most recent series trough in July 2009, the number of job openings has risen by 1.0 million or 44 percent. This trough immediately followed the end of the recession in June 2009 (as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research). Even with the gains since July 2009, the number of job openings in October remained 1.0 million below the 4.4 million openings when the recession began in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of job openings in October (not seasonally adjusted) increased from 12 months earlier for total non-farm and total private. The level was little changed over the year for government overall but decreased for federal government. Over the year, the job openings level increased in seven industries and decreased in two industries. The job openings level was up over the year in three of the four regions: the Northeast, South and West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In October, the hires rate remained at 3.2 percent for total non-farm and the rate was essentially unchanged for all industries and regions. There were 4.2 million hires during the month, 9 percent higher than the most recent series trough in June 2009. This trough coincided with the official end of the recession. Despite the gains since June 2009, the number of hires in October remained below the 5.0 million hires when the recession began in December 2007. Since their respective troughs, the hires level has risen at a slower pace than the job openings level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the 12 months ending in October, the hires rate (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed for total non-farm and total private but fell slightly for government. The hires rate increased over the past 12 months in retail trade, decreased in real estate and rental and leasing and was essentially unchanged in the remaining industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Separations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Total separations includes quits (voluntary separations), layoffs and discharges (involuntary separations) and other separations (including retirements). The total separations, or turnover, rate in October was little changed for total non-farm and total private, but the rate decreased for government. Over the 12 months ending in October, the total separations rate (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed for total non-farm, total private and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quits rate can serve as a measure of workers&amp;rsquo; willingness or ability to change jobs. In October, the quits rate was little changed for total non-farm (1.5 percent), total private (1.7 percent) and government (0.5 percent) and in every industry and region. The number of quits in October (2.0 million) is somewhat higher than the series trough in September 2009 (1.7 million), but it is still well below the series peak in November 2006 (3.2 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the 12 months ending in October, the quits rate (not seasonally adjusted) increased for total non-farm; total private; professional and business services; and arts, entertainment and recreation as well as in the Midwest and South regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The layoffs and discharges component of total separations is seasonally adjusted at the total non-farm, total private and government levels. The layoffs and discharges level was essentially unchanged in October for total non-farm and total private but fell for government. The number of layoffs and discharges for total non-farm peaked at 2.6 million in January 2009, falling to 1.7 million in October 2010. In government, the number of layoffs and discharges in October (108,000) was lower than when the recession began in December 2007 (117,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) declined over the 12 months ending in October for total non-farm and total private, but the level increased in federal government. The layoffs and discharges level declined over the year in many industries and in the South and Midwest regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The other separations series is not seasonally adjusted. In October, there were 302,000 other separations for total non-farm, 257,000 for total private and 44,000 for government. Compared to October 2009, the number of other separations was little changed for total non-farm and total private. The number of other separations decreased over the year for federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relative Contributions to Separations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The total separations level is influenced by the relative contribution of its three components &amp;ndash; quits, layoffs and discharges and other separations. The percentage of total separations at the total non-farm level attributable to the individual components has varied over time, but for the majority of the months&amp;nbsp;since the series began in December 2000, the proportion of quits has exceeded the proportion of layoffs and discharges. Other separations is historically a very small portion of total separations; it has rarely been above 10 percent of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since February 2010, the proportions of quits and of layoffs and discharges at the total non-farm level have been close. In October 2010, the proportion of quits for total non-farm was 49 percent and the proportion of layoffs and discharges was 42 percent. For total private, the proportions were 50 percent quits and 43 percent layoffs and discharges. For government, the proportions were 39 percent quits and 39 percent layoffs and discharges. The proportion of layoffs and discharges in government had been higher than usual in parts of 2009 and 2010 due to layoffs of temporary Census 2010 workers. This proportion decreased in October as most temporary Census 2010 workers had already been discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/1rekMjYGsfc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chart: Unemployment rate by month since January 2008</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In November, the unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent; it was 9.6 percent in each of the prior&amp;nbsp;three months. The number of unemployed persons was 15.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Unemployment rate, January 2008âNovember 2010" border="1" height="360" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101207.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2010/ted_20101207_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (10.0 percent), adult women (8.4 percent), whites (8.9 percent) and Hispanics (13.2 percent) edged up in November. The jobless rate for blacks (16.0 percent) showed little change over the month, while the rate for teenagers declined to 24.6 percent. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.6 percent, not seasonally adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs rose by 390,000 to 9.5 million in November. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 6.3 million and accounted for 41.9 percent of the unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In November, about 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force, up from 2.3 million a year earlier, not seasonally adjusted. These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the marginally attached, there were 1.3 million discouraged workers in November, an increase of 421,000 from a year earlier, not seasonally adjusted. Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>The secret to high-performance organizations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The preponderance of environment news in the media today started me thinking of how important the &amp;ldquo;environment&amp;rdquo; is in the corporate world as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You see, the quality of the environment (i.e. the culture) really does matter. Business leaders must take ultimate responsibility for shaping the environment within which their people live and must be good stewards of it as well, managing for the long-term consequences. The only way to judge an organization&amp;rsquo;s commitment to a healthy, sustainable and robust culture is to examine the choices leaders make &amp;ndash; including the choice of where they put culture on the organizational list of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad habits develop in good times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The choices we face, the decisions we make and the results we achieve all have to do with the health of the environment within which we operate. We develop our bad habits in good times and we develop our good habits in bad times. In other words, I cannot imagine there is any better time than right now to take a long, hard look at the question of organizational culture and determine what can and should be done to ensure the environment is helping, not hurting, your chances for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our work over the years, we have searched long and hard for the secret to high performance and the elusive tonic to guarantee success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But chances are, there is no one, single, definitive answer, no matter how hard we look or how badly we want it. There are, however, some broad guidelines and concepts that are well worth examining and baking into the cultural profile for any organization. I believe in a framework (based on the one created by Booz Inc.) called Organizational DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In simple terms, the framework suggests there are four interwoven strands of DNA that can be decoded to help diagnose the state of an organization&amp;rsquo;s culture. It is a simple concept but, in fact, the power of its insight comes from that simplicity. The four strands to examine are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Structure and Effectiveness: &lt;/strong&gt;Is the organization structured in a way that enables performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Decision Making: &lt;/strong&gt;Are the &amp;ldquo;decision rights&amp;rdquo; clearly vested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Transfer: &lt;/strong&gt;Does information get from those who have it to those who need it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Motivators &amp;amp; Differentiators: &lt;/strong&gt;What basket of tools is used to guide and direct behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The truth of the matter is, the DNA of a &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; culture cannot be reduced to just one set of attributes or principles. As with so many things in organizational life, the context has to be taken into account and, frankly, it is more important to have the culture aligned with the context than simply to have the ideal formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are three broad categories of &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; cultures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Just-in-Time Model: &lt;/strong&gt;The culture focuses on seizing opportunities. The organization is quick to change course and does not hesitate to head off in a new direction when the winds of change indicate an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Military Precision Model: &lt;/strong&gt;The organization is responsive to &amp;ldquo;commands&amp;rdquo; from the inner circle at the top which can quickly galvanize the troops into perfect alignment and they then fly in formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Resilient Model: &lt;/strong&gt;The organization is able to ride over any rough patches and come away from that experience even better or stronger. Typically, this type of organization does not allow ego to blur its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations are living, breathing, dynamic creatures. As such, they suffer from the same flaws, imperfections, obsessions and biases as do the people who work in them &amp;ndash; and the leaders who guide them. The possible dysfunctions of organizational life are many and the variations endless. There are, however, a few basic &amp;ldquo;pathologies&amp;rdquo; we can use to identify the fundamental diseases and discomforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are four broad categories of &amp;ldquo;unhealthy&amp;rdquo; cultures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Over-Managed Model: &lt;/strong&gt;A very common category of misfit, these organizations have built in multiple levels of supervision and prefers endless analysis and talk to action and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Outgrown Model: &lt;/strong&gt;Typically, this can be observed most readily by the fact the stress and strain levels are high and the organization is just barely hanging on. It tends to be controlled by a very few people at the top who micromanage in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Fits and Starts Model: &lt;/strong&gt;The organization has plenty of energy and plenty of talent, but cannot seem to stay the course on anything it starts. The attention span of the leaders is short and that flows down to the levels below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Passive Aggressive Model: &lt;/strong&gt;A more common dysfunction than you might think, this organization suffers from what Jack Welch calls &amp;ldquo;superficial congeniality&amp;rdquo;. Things look good on the surface, but just underneath jealousies and bad behaviours run rampant &amp;ndash; both ignored and tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the world that exists just outside the walls of the large conglomerate or multinational corporation &amp;ndash; we have long relied upon the work of anthropologists to help us understand culture. Their work is fundamentally to help us decipher and understand the genetic code of the particular tribe in question, by examining their rituals, customs and habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an organizational context, that list includes attitudes and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In both cases (ancient or modern) we know that, for some reason, certain cultures thrive for a short while, some thrive for a long time and some die a quick and merciful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose well, you thrive. Choose poorly ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It seems the mind-sets, attitudes, belief systems and approach which the &amp;ldquo;tribe&amp;rdquo; chooses, make the ultimate difference. Choose well &amp;ndash; you thrive. Choose poorly &amp;ndash; you die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In either case, the culture that emerges is a choice, not just a random set of events, equivalent to a plague or a famine. The culture of an organization matters a great deal. It is the culture, the unspoken, the ephemeral that actually shapes the view the organization has and, as such, it defines the choices it puts before itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my next column, I will focus on the importance of an organizations Values and Competencies in shaping its success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Culture drives an organization to superior results</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Sitting just alongside the attitudes and beliefs of an organization is a companion set of attributes that round out the cultural blueprint. It is represented by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Values&lt;/strong&gt;: espoused and held to be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Competencies&lt;/strong&gt;: nurtured to drive performance and build talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is a pretty simple formula &amp;ndash; so simple that many seem to think they need a greater order of complexity in order to justify the adoption of a set of basic principles aimed at ensuring the culture is able to be self sustaining, healthy and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I couldn&amp;rsquo;t disagree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over-engineering is simply hiding from the truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In fact, organizations over complicate and over engineer in order to hide from the truth that may emerge if they were to focus on just the &amp;ldquo;vital few&amp;rdquo; and make them visible to the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my view, attitudes and beliefs correspond with character, while values and competencies correspond with competence. Together, they define the culture of the organization and the genetic code, or DNA, that will either allow them to thrive, survive or die!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In our continuing study of organizational culture and high performance, which has incorporated the thinking and efforts of many others who practice in this field and whose contribution is enormous (if unheralded), I am constantly amazed by how much &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; exists in the typical organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The noise amounts to the cultural equivalent of toxic waste and displaced energy, and is a sure sign of lack of focus. Chatter, confusion, speculation and miscommunication all contribute to a loss of value &amp;ndash; but does anyone care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some simple principles I have come to believe in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A culture that suffers from noise -&amp;nbsp;cannot be a focused culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A culture that is not focused on the right stuff &amp;ndash; cannot aspire to high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A high-performance culture &amp;ndash; makes crisp focus a competency for all leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A good leader makes focus on the customer &amp;ndash; the critical imperative for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a few things we know for sure about talent. Simply put &amp;ndash; talented people want to work with other talented people and will only work for talented leaders. In this case, it is pretty easy to see why the cultural environment matters so much to talented people who will only work in conditions that maximize their abilities and potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The truly talented have options, alternatives and confidence that do not exist in the more mediocre layers of the human capital structure and so are less loyal on one hand and much less tolerant on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Leaders of an organization which genuinely seek to perform at the highest level know they need talented people (from both within and outside) because they know there are some special tasks and responsibilities that need to be addressed. The more talented the people, the higher their ability to live with ambiguity and the better the odds they will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Identify, define and scope the issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Solve the frustrating dilemmas and wicked problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Resolve the hidden tensions and incongruities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Overcome the barriers and obstacles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reason culture matters, and the reason the environment a leader creates is so important, is not simply to win an award or have satisfied employees. The real reason is to drive business results and achieve superior organizational performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That is the only way to secure the necessary resources to implement the programs, create the tools and develop the talent that allows performance to be sustained. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be unkind, but have you ever conducted the &amp;ldquo;lobby test&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here is how it goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Walk into the lobby of your best customer, your major competitor or, even better, your most underperforming business unit and just hang out for a morning. The things you see and hear will scare you to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	High-performing cultures don&amp;rsquo;t accept what you will find in those lobbies. Not because they have abolished the pollution and shame with policies, but because the culture looks after the little things through a combination of pride and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let us assume, for a moment, that any organization worth its salt wants to achieve superior results and wants to do so for as long as they possibly can. If so, they should realize the price they have to pay is in doing whatever it takes to create &amp;ldquo;winning conditions&amp;rdquo;. These are the conditions, reflected by the cultural environment, that allow people to deliver results by creating a willingness to devote a higher share of their &amp;ldquo;discretionary investment&amp;rdquo; than in an average or mediocre organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But extrinsic, that is, non-essential, motivation will only take you so. The more powerful enabler is intrinsic volition, and that can only emerge in an organizational culture that understands how much the &amp;ldquo;contract&amp;rdquo; has been re-written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the day, organizational strategy is not implemented in a vacuum. The success of a particular strategy is dependent upon the environment within which it is set. In organizational life, that environment is the culture. In order to be successful, great strategy needs to be augmented by great culture and needs to be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But you have to know what you are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, identify the gap: There is absolutely no point avoiding bad news. Ignorance is not an excuse. The worst truth is still better than the best lie. If you are going to be serious about building a better, healthier culture, then you&amp;rsquo;d better find what&amp;rsquo;s broken or not working well, and begin to address it &amp;ndash; head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, think forward: Most of us get some comfort from the past and the warm memories that wrap us in nostalgia, providing some temporary relief from the stresses and strains of the day. However, when it comes to culture, the key is to aim for a moving target, off in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s not good enough to reflect on yesterday, or even build for today. You have to predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Third, make hard choices: There is always more than one choice when you come to a fork in the road. Typically, there is the tried, tested and comfortable path and then there is the other one. The road less travelled. In the case of organizational culture redesign, it&amp;rsquo;s better to make the tough choice, rather than take the easy path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Close the escape hatch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fourth, enforce accountability: It seems that all too often, the best intentions of the leadership team are not fulfilled and the promise that existed evaporates into thin air. All too often, this is because the escape hatches were left wide open and, when it was convenient, some people found it too tempting to avoid accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fifth, keep score: The joy of victory is sweet. When the trophy is lifted over your head, and you look into the eyes of your opponent and see their disappointment, you do not so much gloat as be glad the game was played and you came out on top. In any game, including the game of business, you need to keep score.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Job interview book stresses importance of standing out</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The job interview books keep coming. There have to be hundreds on the market, each one regurgitating the same tired information. Amazingly, they sell or else publishers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though most of the books rehash or try to put a new spin on proven advice, a few of the new ones offer solid tips worth heeding. Garrett Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em sc="14"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" class="aptureLink " id="apture_prvw2" sc="11"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" apturedynamictext="true" class="aptureLinkIcon" sc="13" style="background-position: right -1349px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a aptureized="true" class="aptureLink snap_noshots" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608445410?tag=troymedicorp-20" sc="12"&gt;&lt;em modo="false"&gt;Hire on a WHIM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is one of them. Miller is a career coach based in Andover, N.J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The premise of his interview strategy rests on standing out from the competition. The United States Marines&amp;rsquo; slogan, &lt;em&gt;The Few, The Proud, the Marines&lt;/em&gt;, exemplifies the importance of demonstrating that superiority, Miller asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies are &amp;ldquo;looking for a few special candidates with the right skills and qualities to join their ranks,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Miller says that the following seven tips can&amp;nbsp;set you apart from the competition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Make small talk. &lt;/strong&gt;Small talk is a good way to learn something about the interviewer. Looking for something to say? Some topics of conversation include: sports, front-page news, and local events, to name a few. The idea is keep it light. It&amp;rsquo;s best to stay clear of expressing political or religious opinions. The goal of small talk is to explore common ground so that interviewers get a sense of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take notes. &lt;/strong&gt;Taking occasional notes during an interview tells interviewers that what they are saying is important to you. It also shows you are good at listening, you&amp;rsquo;re paying attention to detail, and you are prepared. When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to ask questions, refer back to a comment, statistic, or observation you jotted down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sit at attention. &lt;/strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get too relaxed: Sitting back in the chair and crossing your legs may be comfortable to you, but the message you are sending lacks energy. Instead, sit straight up and occasionally lean in when you are excited. This body language signals a higher energy level &amp;ndash; and your interviewer will remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Be enthusiastic. &lt;/strong&gt;Tell your story with enthusiasm. Make sure you come across as excited. If you can&amp;rsquo;t get excited about your own story, how can a recruiter expect you to get excited about their company&amp;rsquo;s story? Without being over the top, showing some emotion is a good thing. It also demonstrates good communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5. Arrive early.&lt;/strong&gt; To most recruiters that&amp;rsquo;s 15 minutes prior to the interview. Arriving five minutes early is considered late. It sends the signal that you are a &amp;ldquo;just in time&amp;rdquo; kind of employee and didn&amp;rsquo;t allow enough time to get to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By arriving at least 15 minutes early, you have time to compose yourself and get ready for the interview. &amp;ldquo;Sitting quietly before an interview could be the most important five minutes you spend that day,&amp;rdquo; says Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6. Edit yourself. &lt;/strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be a chatty. There is no need to tell your whole story. If you begin your answer with, &amp;ldquo;I was born in Guilford, CT,&amp;rdquo; then you are providing too much detail. Answer the questions fully, and then ask if they would like more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7. Ask relevant questions. &lt;/strong&gt;Prepare at least one or two questions beforehand. Miller says recruiters dismiss candidates who don&amp;rsquo;t ask questions as neither interested in the job or engaged in the interview process. By the same token, avoid questions that focus on what the company can do for you. &amp;ldquo;Instead, ask insightful questions about what you can do for the company,&amp;rdquo; he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/m1kDUSkPGr8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Determined to succeed: Some people just wonât quit</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Have you ever felt like giving up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Perhaps you have a dream you&amp;rsquo;ve worked long and hard to achieve, but it still seems out of reach. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re going through a difficult time looking for a job, or you&amp;rsquo;re working but just getting by, and burdened with debt. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a divorce, suffering the loss of a loved one, or facing an illness. You hate your boss; you failed your mid-terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whatever adversities we face, there are days &amp;ndash; perhaps weeks and months &amp;ndash; when we want to pull the covers over our heads and stop trying. Some of us give up altogether, yet others manage to persevere. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between those who quit, and those who just won&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determined to succeed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	My friend Jorge Perez, a screenwriter and personal trainer in his 30&amp;rsquo;s, has worked 12 hour days, ssix days a week for the last three years, putting every extra waking hour and every penny he&amp;rsquo;s earned &amp;ndash; close to $100,000 &amp;ndash; into Bodies of Work, an independent TV pilot he wrote, cast, directed and shot. He&amp;rsquo;s determined to be a success, but when he gets discouraged, he thinks of what he learned from the book&lt;em&gt;&lt;em sc="14"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" class="aptureLink " id="apture_prvw2" sc="11"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" apturedynamictext="true" class="aptureLinkIcon" sc="13" style="background-position: right -1349px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a aptureized="true" class="aptureLink snap_noshots" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AXS51A?tag=troymedicorp-20" sc="12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Racing in the Rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;by Garth Stein. &amp;ldquo;Your car goes where your eyes go. In other words, wherever you focus your attention is where you&amp;rsquo;re headed, with related consequences. It takes the same energy to focus on positive outcomes as negative ones, with better results.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recently I met 22-year-old Lily Eagle Dormand Colby. She was born to mentally ill, drug-addicted parents and spent years being shuffled around foster care. At the age of 16, Lily sought legal independence and became a de facto parent to her 13-year-old autistic brother. She put herself through Yale on full scholarship, is currently interning in the office of United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and is working with two U.S. Senators on foster care reform. In January, Lily will enter law school at Berkeley. When asked how she keeps going she says, &amp;ldquo;I learned never to take no for an answer. You have to speak your mind, even if your voice shakes.&amp;rdquo; She also learned to reach out for support wherever she could find it &amp;ndash; in her case, from teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not giving up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For lessons on resilience, I never had to look any further than my own late sister, whose dying words were, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not giving up.&amp;rdquo; Pam battled Cystic Fibrosis, lived independently, graduated college with an honours diploma in Early Childhood Education, and ran her own daycare before her illness took its final toll. Pam taught me that even when you are at your most powerless and feeling like you can&amp;rsquo;t go on, you still have the power to choose between faith or fear, despair or hope, forgiveness or revenge. She espoused the words of Viktor Frankl: &amp;ldquo;When you can&amp;rsquo;t change your circumstances, you are challenged to change yourself.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harvard Professor Dr. Shelley H. Carson, author of&lt;em sc="19"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" class="aptureLink " id="apture_prvw3" sc="16"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" apturedynamictext="true" class="aptureLinkIcon" sc="18" style="background-position: right -1349px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a aptureized="true" class="aptureLink snap_noshots" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470547634?tag=troymedicorp-20" sc="17"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Creative Brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, says that resilience is a synthesis of biological, psychological and social factors. &amp;ldquo;While there appears to be some genetic influence to resilience, much of it is determined by one&amp;rsquo;s mental attitude and ability to mobilize others on one&amp;rsquo;s own behalf.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualities of resilient people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Resilient people, says Dr. Carson, have three qualities:&lt;br /&gt;
	1) They focus on what they have rather than on what they don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;br /&gt;
	2) They experience and exhibit gratitude for what they have.&lt;br /&gt;
	3) They are realistically optimistic. They accept their present circumstances and they make the best of it. They focus on the best way to move forward and set goals to do so, rather than looking back or blaming others for their current difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Like almost any behaviour, resilience can be learned, says Sam Goldstein, co-author of &lt;em sc="24"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" class="aptureLink " id="apture_prvw4" sc="21"&gt;&lt;span apture="true" apturedynamictext="true" class="aptureLinkIcon" sc="23" style="background-position: right -1349px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a aptureized="true" class="aptureLink snap_noshots" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071431985?tag=troymedicorp-20" sc="22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power of Resilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Negative thinking is a bad habit you can change by teaching yourself to re-frame your experiences and expectations. To increase your resilience, stay connected to others, pick your battles, look after your health by maintaining good diet and exercise, maintain a sense of wonder, and give back to your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the best examples I know of giving back instead of giving up is former actor Mel Ryane, who left Canada for Hollywood and found her career shrinking as she aged. When a flyer showed up on her doorstep asking for volunteers for her local school, she created &amp;ldquo;The Shakespeare Club,&amp;rdquo; for grades 3, 4 and 5. She&amp;rsquo;s changed hundreds of kid&amp;rsquo;s lives over the last few years by mounting full-scale productions of Shakespeare with them.&amp;nbsp;She&amp;rsquo;s also written a memoir of the experience, and her blog, &lt;a href="http://www.teachingwill.com/" modo="false" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.teachingwill.com/');" target="_blank" title="http://www.teachingwill.com/"&gt;http://www.teachingwill.com/&lt;/a&gt;, has become a sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Winston Churchill once admonished, &amp;ldquo;Never, never, never, never give up.&amp;rdquo; However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know the difference between giving up and surrender. Giving up is an act of anger or despair. It implies there&amp;rsquo;s still some fight left, some unfinished business to complete. Surrender is a release, a peace in knowing there is nothing more to give or receive in a given situation, a grace in the letting go. Sometimes we have to recognize that difference, and learn how to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ultimately, of course, our final destination is a letting go &amp;ndash; but until then, don&amp;rsquo;t give up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New-year hiring plans indicate progress toward recovery in world's largest economies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Results for the first quarter 2011 global Manpower Employment Outlook Survey released December 7 by Manpower Inc. suggest a more positive start to the new year for the global labor market. Data reveals improved hiring expectations from 12 months ago in 28 of 39 countries and territories, including the G7 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, where hiring plans are stable or improved from both the fourth quarter of 2010 and this time last year. Despite continued mixed results across Europe, German employers are reporting their strongest hiring plans since early 2008. Meanwhile, hiring intentions among U.S. employers remain modest but signal the most optimistic first-quarter outlook in three years. Job prospects continue to be robust across the Asia Pacific region with Chinese and Indian employers reporting the most optimistic hiring intentions globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The stability and incremental improvement reflected in the data for the G7 countries indicates progress toward recovery for the global labor market. In fact, Net Employment Outlooks for the G7 countries are all in positive territory for the first time since the third quarter of 2008,&amp;quot; said Jeffrey A. Joerres, chairman and CEO of Manpower Inc. &amp;quot;Nonetheless, the global market still has a long way to go as employers are not yet confident enough to hire for permanent positions on any noteworthy scale. With workforces stretched so thin in recovering markets, we&amp;#39;re seeing companies experience a choke point as demand picks up &amp;ndash; at this point companies are either hiring very selectively and/or increasing their use of contingent labor. The employment picture is very different in the Asia Pacific market where employers are feeling the talent crunch in the face of strong demand and are working hard to recruit and retain employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Manpower survey shows employers in 32 of 39 countries and territories expect varying degrees of positive hiring activity in the first three months of the year, with those in India, China, Taiwan, Brazil, Turkey and Singapore reporting the strongest hiring plans. In contrast, employers in Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Ireland, Spain and Romania report the weakest and only negative forecasts globally. Employers in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Turkey were surveyed for the first time this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employer hiring plans continue to be mixed across the 21 countries surveyed in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, with positive activity expected in 14 countries. While Net Employment Outlooks weakened in 11 countries from three months ago, a year-over-year comparison reveals stronger Outlooks in 12 countries. Hiring activity in the EMEA region is expected to be strongest in Turkey, Germany and Sweden and weakest in Greece and the Czech Republic. The strong hiring pace anticipated in Turkey is due in part to demand in the Construction sector where 45 percent of employers intend to add staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The bright spot in Europe continues to be Germany, where the unemployment rate is at its lowest in 18 years and engineers and financial professionals continue to be in high demand. In fact, the hiring forecast from Finance and Business Services employers is the strongest first-quarter outlook since we began surveying the German market in 2003,&amp;quot; said Joerres. &amp;quot;In contrast, employer hiring confidence in the Greek and Spanish markets continues to erode. However, data for Italy shows improved hiring expectations for the third consecutive quarter resulting in the first positive forecast from Italian employers in more than two years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employer hiring expectations continue to be strong in the Asia Pacific region where job prospects improve year-over-year in all eight countries and territories surveyed. Compared to three months ago, job prospects are improved or remain stable in six countries and territories. Regional hiring plans continue to be strongest in India, China and Taiwan and weakest in Japan, despite a cautiously optimistic forecast from employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In India and China, employer demand remains high; individuals with in-demand skills continue to be poached by rival firms making engagement and retention strategies a critical priority for both foreign and domestic organizations,&amp;quot; said Joerres. &amp;quot;Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers, particularly those in textiles, are being challenged with worker shortages, rapidly rising wages and competition from other low-cost countries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Across the 10 countries surveyed in the Americas region, forecasts from employers are stronger in comparison to the first quarter of 2010 in all countries except Guatemala and mixed compared to three months ago. However, all countries in the region should experience generally positive hiring activity in the quarter ahead. Regional hiring plans are most optimistic in Brazil and Peru and least optimistic in Guatemala and the U.S., although the report from U.S. employers has improved slightly from both three months ago and last year at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Seasonally adjusted data for the United States indicates the most optimistic first-quarter hiring sentiment in three years; yet 73 percent of employers indicate they will keep staff levels unchanged,&amp;quot; said Joerres. &amp;quot;So while we&amp;#39;re seeing positive signals in the data, only time will tell if we&amp;#39;ve reached the inflection point in the U.S. labor market recovery. On the other hand, the enthusiasm in the Brazilian market continues to be bolstered by the Services sector where over half of employers are telling us they will increase their payrolls in the next three months. In Mexico and Argentina, opportunities for job seekers should be much improved compared to 12 months ago, particularly in the Mexican Manufacturing sector where employer hiring intentions remain the most optimistic in eight years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/MqnX-qUPJzY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Employment outlook poll shows most promising U.S. hiring outlook since 2008</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Reporting the most optimistic hiring expectations in more than two years, United States employers anticipate small staffing gains for Quarter 1 2011, according to the seasonally adjusted results of the latest Manpower Employment Outlook Survey, conducted quarterly by Manpower Inc. The adjusted Outlook for Quarter 1 2011 is +9 percent, up from +5 percent during the same period last year and +5 percent during Quarter 4 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This quarter&amp;#39;s survey reveals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Five straight quarters of employment growth: &lt;/strong&gt;Employers report a positive overall hiring Outlook since the start of 2010, according to seasonally adjusted data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Widespread stability: &lt;/strong&gt;The percentage of employers planning to keep staff levels unchanged persists at unsurpassed levels, and those in seven of the 13 industry sectors surveyed expect to remain relatively stable compared to Quarter 4 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Current outlook still below past decade&amp;rsquo;s average: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite positive signals, the Quarter 1 2011 Outlook is nearly five percentage points below the average Outlook from 2001 to 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Across nearly all geographies in the world, the confidence to do additional hiring is improving,&amp;quot; said Manpower chairman and CEO Jeff Joerres. &amp;quot;However, like the U.S., the lack of robust demand for products and services is creating a persistent level of uncertainty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of the more than 18,000 employers surveyed, 14 percent anticipate an increase in staff levels in their Quarter 1 2011 hiring plans, while 10 percent expect a decrease in payrolls, resulting in a Net Employment Outlook of +4 percent. When seasonally adjusted, the Net Employment Outlook becomes +9 percent. Seventy- three percent of employers expect no change in their hiring plans. The final 3 percent of employers indicate they are undecided about their hiring intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The fact that hiring expectations are trending upward is an encouraging sign,&amp;quot; said Jonas Prising, Manpower president of the Americas. &amp;quot;This quarter&amp;#39;s survey responses paint a picture of a job market that is easing up, although not as quickly as anyone would like. We are still stuck in first gear, but the ongoing sector-wide improvement we have seen over the last year suggests that the labor market is ready to shift to a higher gear in 2011.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employers in 11 of the 13 industry sectors surveyed have a positive Outlook for Quarter 1 2011: Leisure &amp;amp; Hospitality (+12 percent), Professional &amp;amp; Business Services (+11 percent), Information (+10 percent), Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade (+10 percent), Mining (+6 percent), Durable Goods Manufacturing (+6 percent), Nondurable Goods Manufacturing (+6 percent), Education &amp;amp; Health Services (+6 percent), Other Services (+4 percent), Financial Activities (+4 percent) and Transportation &amp;amp; Utilities (+2 percent). The January-March 2011 Outlook is negative in the Construction (-9 percent) industry, while Government (0 percent) hiring is expected to be flat. Employers in two industry sectors, Mining and Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade, expect their hiring pace to decrease compared to the previous quarter, while those in three industry sectors, Information, Education &amp;amp; Health Services and Leisure &amp;amp; Hospitality, anticipate staff levels picking up. Hiring plans are relatively stable in the remaining industry sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compared to one year ago, employers in all four U.S. geographic regions surveyed anticipate an increased pace of hiring. Employers in the Midwest and South have the most optimistic view, with a Net Employment Outlook of +10 percent. The Outlook is +9 percent for employers in the Northeast and +7 percent for those in the West. When adjusting for seasonal variations, employers in the Northeast, Midwest and West anticipate a moderate increase in hiring compared to one year ago at this time, while employers in the South expect a slight increase. Quarter over quarter, employers in the West report the strongest growth in job prospects with a six point increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	*The Net Employment Outlook, often shortened to simply Outlook or NEO, is derived by taking the percentage of employers anticipating an increase in hiring activity and subtracting from this the percentage of employers expecting a decrease in hiring activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/8GZvXDH_Ta4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Conference Board Employment Trends Index rises again</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Conference Board Employment Trends Index (ETI) increased in November for the second consecutive month, it was announced on December 6. The index now stands at 99.0, up from October&amp;#39;s revised figure of 97.6. The index is up 9.3 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Says Gad Levanon, associate director for macroeconomic research at The Conference Board: &amp;quot;The disappointing employment numbers released last Friday are at odds with most of the leading indicators included in the Employment Trends Index. While we are not expecting economic activity or employment to grow rapidly anytime soon, we do expect employment to continue to moderately increase, following the trend of recent months.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This month&amp;#39;s increase in the ETI was driven by positive contributions from seven out of the eight components. The improving indicators included Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance, Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now, Number of Temporary Employees, Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons, Job Openings, Industrial Production and Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market indicators, each of which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating individual indicators into a composite index filters out so-called &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; to show underlying trends more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The eight labor-market indicators aggregated into the Employment Trends Index include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find &amp;quot;Jobs Hard to Get&amp;quot; (The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now (National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons (BLS)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Job Openings (BLS)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Idaho lost fewer manufacturing jobs in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial employment in Idaho fell 3.6 percent over the past 12 months according to the 2010 Idaho Manufacturers Directory, an industrial directory published annually by Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News Inc. MNI reports Idaho lost 2,813 industrial jobs and 29 manufacturers between October 2009 and October 2010, a much smaller decline than the 7,000-job loss MNI reported over the 2008-2009 survey period.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News reports Idaho is now home to 2,211 manufacturers employing 74,776 workers.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Idaho&amp;rsquo;s industrial sector continue to be battered by the housing bust and the recession, &amp;rdquo; says Tom Dubin, president of the Evanston, Ill.-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912. &amp;ldquo;However, we&amp;rsquo;re definitely seeing fewer job losses than we did a year ago and the state&amp;rsquo;s favorable business climate should help improve the outlook.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Food products manufacturing remains the state&amp;rsquo;s largest industrial sector by employment with 15,773 jobs, down 3.3 percent over the year, due partially to layoffs at ConAgra&amp;rsquo;s plant in Twin Falls. Second-ranked industrial machinery and equipment accounts for 15,492, down just 1.1 percent, while lumber/wood saw a steep decline of 14.3 percent, following the closure of Welco Lumber Company and layoffs at Weyerhaeuser, among others. Lumber and wood currently accounts for 9,109 Idaho industrial workers.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most other industrial sectors in Idaho lost jobs within the past year and included transportation equipment, down 11.2 percent; textiles/apparel, down 7.3 percent; paper products, down 5.3 percent; printing/publishing, down 3.1 percent; stone/clay/glass, down 3 percent; and fabricated metal, down 1.7 percent. Employment in primary metals rose 5.3 percent; electronics climbed 1.4 percent; and chemicals 1.1 percent. Jobs remained steady in the rubber/plastics sector.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Bright spots for the state include the opening of shower and tub manufacturer Best Bath&amp;rsquo;s new plant in Caldwell; the expansion of ON Semiconductor Corporation in Pocatello; the re-opening of XL Four Star Beef Inc. in Nampa; and the opening of Transform Solar, a joint venture of Micron Technology and Origin Energy to produce solar panels in Nampa.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; News reports Northern Idaho saw the largest drop in employment, down 5.6 percent over the year, and is currently home to 14,622 industrial workers. Manufacturing employment declined 4.1 percent in Southwest Idaho, with the region currently home to 41,555 jobs. Industrial employment remained steady in Southeast Idaho, with the region accounting for 18,599 industrial jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	MNI&amp;rsquo;s city data shows Boise is Idaho&amp;rsquo;s top city for manufacturing employment, home to 21,467 jobs, down 3.4 percent over the year. Second-ranked Nampa accounts for 6,635 jobs, up 4.6 percent over the past 12 months. Industrial employment in Idaho Falls also rose over the year, up 1.4 percent and is currently home to 4,494 industrial workers. Lewiston accounts for 3,289 industrial jobs with no significant change over the year, while Pocatello accounts for 3,077 jobs, up 2.5 percent over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Video contest challenges companies to show fun of STEM careers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Dow Chemical Company has accepted a challenge put forth by &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.changetheequation.org%2F&amp;amp;esheet=6534963&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Change+the+Equation&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=0b70b42dce612832babf69a645a33cb6" target="_blank"&gt;Change the Equation&lt;/a&gt; by submitting its new education video for a nationwide competition to bring attention to the need to address America&amp;rsquo;s innovation shortfall. Dow is working hard to receive the most &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; for its video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Change the Equation (CTEq) is a non-profit, CEO-led initiative that answers the call of President Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Educate to Innovate Campaign&amp;rdquo; to move the U.S. to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade. Dow has joined more than 100 other multi-national companies in this effort to enhance careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CTEq is challenging its member companies to submit videos highlighting the interesting things that can be achieved through careers in STEM fields. The videos are being widely promoted through &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchangetheequation%23%21%2Fvideo%2Fvideo.php%3Fv%3D1699310091983&amp;amp;esheet=6534963&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Facebook&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=96bf29237abf5f61dceae28e11105cd0" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FChangeTheEquation&amp;amp;esheet=6534963&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=YouTube&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;md5=d36e4249e815734ef9bbbf711ee88019" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, where you may vote for Dow. Look for the video titled &amp;ldquo;Dow STEM Video Contest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dow will further promote STEM education during the upcoming International Year of Chemistry, a worldwide effort to celebrate the achievements of chemistry and inspire young people to pursue careers in science. The company is the first global partner of that 2011 initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dow&amp;rsquo;s involvement in these efforts aligns with the Company&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Manufacturing Plan that calls for a broad policy framework that will enable economic growth in the U.S. while at the same time considering a multitude of issues ranging from education to tax reform to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can help bring attention to the critical need for innovative STEM education programs in the U.S. by voting for Dow on the CTEq &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchangetheequation%23%21%2Fvideo%2Fvideo.php%3Fv%3D1699310091983&amp;amp;esheet=6534963&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Facebook&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;md5=84f8e9b96cbb851f70b8922a09d141cf" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page and its &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FChangeTheEquation&amp;amp;esheet=6534963&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=YouTube&amp;amp;index=5&amp;amp;md5=4a5b702f3cf12efc567edeb5a4a10aa6" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; site. Voting is from December 6 to December 19.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>U.S. unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent in November</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent in November, and non-farm payroll employment was little changed (+39,000), the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on December 3. Temporary help services and health care continued to add jobs over the month, while employment fell in retail trade. Employment in most major industries changed little in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Household Survey Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The number of unemployed persons was 15.1 million in November. The unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent; it was 9.6 percent in each of the prior three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (10.0 percent), adult women (8.4 percent), whites (8.9 percent) and Hispanics (13.2 percent) edged up in November. The jobless rate for blacks (16.0 percent) showed little change over the month, while the rate for teenagers declined to 24.6 percent. The jobless rate for Asians was 7.6 percent, not seasonally adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs rose by 390,000 to 9.5 million in November. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 6.3 million and accounted for 41.9 percent of the unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The civilian labor force participation rate held at 64.5 percent in November, and the employment-population ratio was essentially unchanged at 58.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed over the month at 9.0 million. These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	About 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the labor force in November, up from 2.3 million a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the marginally attached, there were 1.3 million discouraged workers in November, an increase of 421,000 from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.2 million persons marginally attached to the labor force had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishment Survey Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Total non-farm payroll employment changed little in November (+39,000). Job gains continued in temporary help services and in health care, while employment fell in retail trade. Since December 2009, total payroll employment has increased by an average of 86,000 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within professional and business services, employment in temporary help services continued to increase in November (+40,000) and has risen by 494,000 since September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Health care continued to add jobs over the month, with a gain of 19,000. Much of the increase occurred in hospitals (+8,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in mining continued to trend up over the month. Support activities for mining added 6,000 jobs in November and has added 74,000 jobs since October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Retail trade employment fell by 28,000 in November. Job losses occurred in department stores (-9,000) and in furniture and home furnishings stores (-5,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employment in manufacturing was little changed over the month (-13,000). Following job growth earlier in 2010, employment has been relatively flat, on net, since May. Employment in most other major industries changed little in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The average workweek for all employees on private non-farm payrolls held at 34.3 hours in November. The manufacturing workweek for all employees also was unchanged, at 40.3 hours, and factory overtime remained at 3.1 hours. The average workweek for production and non-supervisory employees on private non-farm payrolls decreased by 0.1 hour to 33.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In November, average hourly earnings of all employees on private non-farm payrolls increased by 1 cent to $22.75. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 1.6 percent. In November, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and non-supervisory employees were unchanged at $19.19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The change in total non-farm payroll employment for September was revised from -41,000 to -24,000, and the change for October was revised from +151,000 to +172,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/V_HprIAbdVM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Researchers document effects of supervisors' misdeeds on employee health, productivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, the American workplace has been infused with unprecedented levels of hostility &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s largely due to the deterioration of supervisor-subordinate trust, according to Florida State University researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To better understand this deteriorating relationship, Wayne Hochwarter, the Jim Moran Professor of Business Administration in Florida State&amp;rsquo;s College of Business, and research associate Christian Ponder asked more than 750 mid-level employees to report how often they personally experienced their direct supervisor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Seven Deadly Sins&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; wrath/anger, greed, laziness/sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony &amp;ndash; at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Seven Deadly Sins is a classification of objectionable behaviors that has been used since early Christian times to educate and instruct followers concerning humanity&amp;rsquo;s tendency to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We choose these particular behaviors because they have an established history, are familiar to people in both religious and secular settings, and are documented to strain interpersonal relationships at work,&amp;rdquo; Hochwarter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Results indicate malevolent supervisor behaviors in excess of what many might expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		26 percent of employees said their boss frequently has trouble managing his or her anger (wrath);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		27 percent of employees said their boss vigorously pursues undeserved rewards (greed);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		41 percent of employees said their boss habitually pushes work on to others rather than doing it himself or herself (laziness);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		31 percent of employees said their boss regularly seeks undeserved admiration from others at work (pride);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		33 percent of employees said their boss makes sure that others stroke his or her ego on a daily basis (lust);&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		19 percent of employees said their boss can be counted on to act enviously toward others who experience good things (jealous); and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		23 percent of employees said that their boss purposefully hoards resources that could be useful to others at work (gluttony).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without question, the most frequently reported leader behaviors across genders, industry sectors, and levels of responsibility were pride and laziness. Of little surprise: Results indicated a variety of negative employee outcomes associated with supervisors&amp;rsquo; aberrant behavior, including impaired work productivity and poorer heath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Employees with leaders who committed these &amp;lsquo;sins&amp;rsquo; contributed less effort (40 percent less), felt overloaded as a result of forced responsibility for their supervisor&amp;rsquo;s work (33 percent more), were less likely to make creative suggestions (66 percent less), and received fewer resources to effectively do their job (60 percent less) than those without this negative type of leadership,&amp;rdquo; Ponder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, victims of supervisors&amp;rsquo; self-serving behavior spent considerably more time at work pursuing alternative job opportunities (75 percent more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In terms of deteriorating health, victimized workers experienced more daily anxiety (50 percent more), less happiness in life (30 percent less), more physical and emotional exhaustion (45 percent more), and more gloominess while on the job (62 percent more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the researchers, the good news is that there still are more considerate managers than selfish ones. However, it is evident that recession-based uncertainty has encouraged many business leaders to pursue self-serving behaviors at the expense of those that are considered mutually beneficial or supportive of organizational goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is always interesting to see how people react when they feel that their backs are against the wall,&amp;rdquo; Ponder said. &amp;ldquo;Some leaders try to rally the troops, while others decide to go it alone to safeguard what they feel they have.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps when the cloud of recession fully lifts and job environments become more stable, leaders will focus on employee development rather than self-preservation, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, since progress is viewed only in the distant horizon by many experts, employees at all supervisory levels must develop the skills to peacefully co-exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The consequences of not doing so are increasingly fatal for organizations,&amp;rdquo; according to Hochwarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the words of a 43-year-old accountant who participated in the study, &amp;ldquo;When it comes to my boss, what&amp;rsquo;s his is his, and what&amp;rsquo;s mine is his as well. Actually, what I really mean is that all that is good is his and all that is bad and stressful is mine; this drives me crazy to the point of giving up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/nIAJOCWcELk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chart: Mass layoffs for manufacturing, other industries, in October</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The total number of mass layoff events in October was 1,642 on a not seasonally adjusted basis; the number of associated initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits was 148,638. The 351 mass layoff events in the manufacturing sector accounted for 21 percent of all mass layoff events, and the 40,861 initial claims accounted for 27 percent of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits filed in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Industry distribution: Mass layoff events, October 2010&amp;#13;&amp;#10;" border="1" height="480" src="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/images/2010/ted_20101202a.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	[&lt;a class="nav" href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2010/ted_20101202_data.htm"&gt;Chart data&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Government registered over-the-year increases in mass layoff events and initial claims. Year-to-date initial claim totals through October for government are the highest on record (with data available back to 1996), due in part to layoffs in educational services and the completion of work on the decennial census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fourteen of the 19 major industry sectors in the private economy reported over-the-year decreases in initial claims, led by manufacturing. Manufacturing reached an October program low in terms of average weekly claims. Within manufacturing, the number of claimants in October was greatest in food and transportation equipment. Fifteen of the 21 manufacturing subsectors experienced over-the-year decreases in initial claims, with the largest declines in transportation equipment and in machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This data is from the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/mls/"&gt;Mass Layoff Statistics&lt;/a&gt; program. See &amp;quot;Mass Layoffs &amp;mdash; October 2010&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/mmls_11232010.htm"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/mmls_11232010.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), news release USDL-10-1627, to learn more. Each mass layoff action involved at least 50 persons from a single employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/VxMBBP_7tgs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Oshkosh Defense recognized as military-friendly employer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Oshkosh Defense, a division of Oshkosh Corporation, has been named one of G.I. Jobs&amp;rsquo; 2011 Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers. The annual list recognizes companies for their efforts to recruit and support military employees. Oshkosh employs more than 300 active-duty military members and many retired veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Members of the Armed Forces are at the heart of what we do every day,&amp;rdquo; said Andy Hove, Oshkosh Corporation executive vice president and president of Oshkosh Defense. &amp;ldquo;They rely on our vehicles in the field, and are an integral part of our workforce. We understand the valuable experience gained during military service, and we have a history of actively seeking out veterans, Guard members and Reservists in our recruiting efforts. As a veteran, I know our well-supported military personnel have made us a better company, and allow us to better serve our customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In creating the list, G.I. Jobs focuses on a company&amp;rsquo;s military recruiting efforts, the percentage of new hires with prior military service, and policies toward National Guard and Reserve service. With a strong commitment to these areas, Oshkosh made the list from a sample of more than 5,000 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For years, Oshkosh has adopted policies to make the company a welcoming place for employees who have prior military service, as well as active members of the Guard and Reserve. The company&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive military-leave program includes: a paid differential to employees who are called up to active military duty; time off for Reservists for yearly training; and programs that help employees and their families stay in touch with deployed loved ones. In 2008, Oshkosh was awarded the Freedom Award from the US Department of Defense, the highest recognition given by the government to employers for support of employees who serve in the National Guard and the Reserve. That same year, Oshkosh also received two awards at the state level from the Wisconsin Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), the Above and Beyond Award and the Pro Patria Award, which is the highest honor given at the state level for companies that adopt policies that make it easier for employees to participate in the National Guard and Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Oshkosh Defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Oshkosh Defense, a division of Oshkosh Corporation, is an industry-leading global designer and manufacturer of tactical military trucks and armored wheeled vehicles, delivering a full product line of conventional and hybrid vehicles, advanced armor options, proprietary suspensions and vehicles with payloads that can exceed 70 tons. Oshkosh Defense provides a global service and supply network including full life-cycle support and remanufacturing, and its vehicles are recognized the world over for superior performance, reliability and protection.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Rockwell Automation's Blake Moret on the importance of talent development</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	For many years, U.S. manufacturers have identified innovation as the most critical factor in their ability to compete in the global marketplace, and an educated and skilled workforce as the most important component in their business success. Yet educational deficits, including the education system&amp;#39;s slow response to the innovations shaping the business world, continue to threaten manufacturers&amp;#39; viability and growth. At a time when the U.S. manufacturing industry demands highly skilled workers, this failure of education risks both the future success of the U.S. industrial sector and the overall competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Manufacturers are now taking action.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>High school prepares students for real-world manufacturing jobs</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	With unemployment holding steady above 9 percent, the jobs market looks bleak. But there is one industry that has added jobs: manufacturing. Ash-har Quraishi of Chicago News Cooperative reports on one public school that&amp;#39;s retooling to help its graduates take advantage of these jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GM makes $4B pension plan contribution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors Company on December 2 confirmed it has made the previously announced voluntary $4 billion cash contribution to its United States hourly and salaried pension plans, with a $2.7 billion contribution going to the hourly plan and $1.3 billion to the salaried plan.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This pension contribution puts us another step closer to our goal of fully funding our pension plans and achieving minimal debt. With a healthy balance sheet, a lower cost structure and focus on revenue generation, we continue to put in place the fundamentals for sustainable success,&amp;rdquo; said Chris Liddell, GM vice chairman and chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of the company&amp;rsquo;s U.S. pension plans were last concurrently remeasured on December 31, 2009 for the 2009 Form 10-K and were underfunded in total by $17.1 billion. The company will next remeasure all of its U.S. pension plans at year end 2010 and their funded status will be included in the 2010 Form 10-K.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	GM U.S. pension plans currently provide benefits to approximately 688,000 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/talent_management/~4/DV5kGEWhVJ8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
