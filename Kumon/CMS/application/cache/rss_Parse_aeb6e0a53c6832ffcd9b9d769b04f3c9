      <title>Electric Power Will Transform Aviation</title>
      <author>webera@bnpmedia.com (Austin Weber)</author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Whenever anyone mentions hybrid-electric vehicles today, most people automatically think of cars, buses and trucks. But, up in the sky, the technology is also getting a lot of attention from aerospace engineers. That&rsquo;s because electric systems are greener, lighter, quieter and more energy-efficient than traditional alternatives.</p>

        <media:description type="plain">In most cases, TSSD fasteners do not require a pilot hole. Once the driver moves to the target position, it spins the fastener and pushes it against the surface of the part. Friction generates heat to melt the surface materials and bore a hole into the parts. As the fastener spins, some of its surface material melts as well, mingling with the molten material and fibers of the base parts and creating a weld. When the fastener is flush with the base materials, the driver stops abruptly and holds the fastener in place. When the materials have cooled and solidified, the driver retracts.
