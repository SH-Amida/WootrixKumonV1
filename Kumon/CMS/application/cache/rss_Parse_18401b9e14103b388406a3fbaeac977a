<description>
 Red Bud Industries recently shipped a 0.375-in. by 72-in. blanking line with stretcher-leveling to Alliance Steel Corp., a steel service center located in Bedford Park, IL. The stretcher-leveler includes Red Bud&#169;#8217;s SureGrip technology that allows various materials, such as hot-rolled, pickled-and-oiled or even coated, to be run without slippage or the need to change the gripper pads, according to company officials. The nonslip metallic grippers reportedly can be used for a year or longer without requiring replacement.
