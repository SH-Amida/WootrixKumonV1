            <title>Ford Boosts Vehicle Production in North American Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company will produce nearly 40,000 additional vehicles this summer by idling 13 plants, including six assembly plants, for just one week instead of the traditional two. The flexibility provided by the UAW-Ford national contract agreement allows the company to take this step to better match capacity with market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are working most of our North American plants at maximum capacity, and we are adding production shifts in three of our assembly plants this month alone,&amp;quot; said Jim Tetreault, vice president of North America Manufacturing. &amp;quot;Requiring more capacity from our plants is a good problem to have, and having the flexibility to add a week of production in our plants goes a long way toward solving it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Ford assembly plants taking just one week of summer shutdown in 2012 include Chicago Assembly, Dearborn Truck, Kentucky Truck, Louisville Assembly, Michigan Assembly and Kansas City Assembly. Other plants taking just one week of shutdown include Dearborn Engine, Chicago Stamping, Cleveland Engine No. 1, Lima Engine, Essex Engine, Sterling and Rawsonville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford&amp;#39;s production boost due to its altered summer shutdown schedule is consistent with the company&amp;#39;s plan to increase its annual vehicle production capacity by 400,000 units.

            <title>Using Dynamic Electric Motor Monitoring to Identify Mechanical Issues</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic electric motor testing is often called on-line testing because it requires the motor to be running and generally assumes the motor is in its natural environment. Dynamic testing involves the connection of voltage probes and current transformers. Connecting dynamic test equipment is safe, quick and non-intrusive. Data is acquired and results are displayed in a summary format. The collected data is compared to the user-entered nameplate information and is presented in a pass/fail format with both current test data and trending logs displayed after each successive test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Motor Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every reliability technician knows that costs associated with motor failures can be devastating to any business operation. Finding that a motor is operating with conditions that create excessive heat or stress is a guide to the technician to make changes in the motor&amp;rsquo;s operation and to monitor its insulation. Knowing that a motor is in imminent danger of failing provides the technician with time to schedule repairs at his convenience rather than having the motor dictate to him due to a catastrophic failure. Reducing unscheduled downtime while increasing efficiency and profitability are common goals of all reliability technicians. Dynamic motor testing and monitoring is a relatively new concept aiding and advancing the capabilities of those responsible for the safe and continuous operation of electric motors and related equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What Dynamic Testing Tells You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A motor is one part of a complete system that includes incoming power quality, the motor and the driven load. Many motor problems are created by poor incoming power quality, and many more problems can be attributed to the load and load-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	State-of-the-art dynamic motor test equipment is capable of separating electrical issues from mechanical issues as well as defining power-related problem areas. Good test equipment will provide an enormous amount of information regarding the incoming power, including voltage levels, imbalances and harmonic content. A small amount of voltage imbalance will result in a much larger amount of current imbalance and increase losses within the motor. Harmonic distortion also results in wasted energy causing overheating due mainly to non-sinusoidal sine waves. These issues directly affect a motor&amp;rsquo;s performance and its ability to handle its load. Overall, poor power quality manifests itself as higher heat within the stator and rotor, reducing efficiency and eventually resulting in premature motor failures. Monitoring power quality and making necessary adjustments are essential in maintaining motor longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides power condition, dynamic testing provides extensive information about the motor&amp;rsquo;s behavior and offers evidence of potential mechanical problem areas. The test equipment tracks current levels and unbalances, load levels and torque-related information. Combining this data with the power quality information, the equipment can predict de-rating factors that indicate potential problem areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque and torque ripple add another piece of the puzzle that is required for consistent and accurate diagnosis of the motor&amp;rsquo;s health. Torque ripple is defined as the division of maximal torque divided by average torque during the acquisition period. The torque ripple itself is a measure of how small the torque band is that surrounds a steady state average torque. Torque ripple is independent of power condition and current level. It provides a visual look at how the driven load is performing and is an indicator of rotor stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing can identify rotor bar problems with a high degree of accuracy, and trending logs make tracking them over time easy and predictable. Rotor bar and cage defects result in lost efficiency and higher heat culminating in premature motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring and tracking efficiency is a very difficult task. The operating efficiency of a motor cannot be easily measured in a field application. Many standards have a number of requirements that commonly can only be fulfilled in a laboratory environment. These standards also usually concentrate on ensuring a proper description of a motor&amp;#39;s capabilities under good operating voltage conditions.&amp;nbsp;In the field, however, there is little room for requirements like uncoupling a motor or regulating the voltage level for a saturation run. Questions regarding a particular motor&amp;#39;s capabilities are found to be secondary in importance when compared to the operating efficiency under the given conditions in the field. The result of such an environment is that true efficiencies are unrealistic to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operating efficiencies, however, are of crucial importance to an energy-conscious management. The requirements for a true measurement of operating efficiency in a field environment are ample and unrealistic (like installing torque transducers on the shaft of the motor and measuring the input power to the motor at the motor terminals, frequently at high voltage levels). Instead of true efficiency measurement, efficiency estimation becomes the only field-friendly approach for energy management.&amp;nbsp;The difference between operating efficiency measurement and operating efficiency estimation is that the former attempts to find the true operating efficiency via direct measurement, while the latter accepts a small measure of inaccuracy for severely increased user friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a controlled laboratory experiment, vibration analysis and dynamic data were acquired on a new 5-horsepower, 460-volt motor. The motor was disassembled, and the outer race of the drive-end bearing was intentionally damaged (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/85b88efa-0fda-4eda-bb53-3abb5bb64f99_Thomas Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 2px; width: 646px; height: 581px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The motor was reassembled, and new data collected. The common formula used in vibration analysis was applied to the data acquired, and the results were posted on both the vibration spectra and the torque spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resulting calculations concluded that the outer race defect should appear at 107 hz with sidebands related to the motor speed in the vibration spectra and twice the fundamental frequency in the torque spectra (Figures 2 and 3). The outer race defect with its sidebands was much easier to determine in the dynamically acquired data than the vibration spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 2. Vibration spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/ca95bc92-7bfd-4f73-b7d5-7a2437a8ea66_Thomas Figure 3.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 398px; height: 298px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 3. Demodulated torque spectra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Rotor Bar Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another laboratory-controlled study, a 1-horsepower motor running under full load on a small dynamometer was tested thoroughly with the dynamic tester. The results were then saved and analyzed. The rotor was removed, and a 5/8-inch hole was drilled through one rotor bar, severing it completely. The motor was assembled and retested under identical conditions. Again, the results were saved and then compared to the original data (Figures 4 and 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/fc0da9cd-eb85-49ac-b2a9-1ecc3007d2cc_Thomas Figure 4.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 295px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/9551e808-da98-4f36-8547-487c25674ae6_Thomas Figure 5.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 387px; height: 296px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The broken rotor bar was clearly defined in the current signature analysis without any difficulty or intensive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cavitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a large electric power plant in North Carolina, mechanics noticed that one of three 15,000-horsepower pumps developed a lower flow level than the other two. The mechanics blamed the motor, while the electricians maintained the pump was at fault. Dynamic electric data was acquired and analyzed. Figure 6 shows the resultant torque ripples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/12/eb3b70c5-41ad-4096-85e6-85945db08a61_Thomas Figure 6.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 388px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Figure 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One pump displayed the large variations in the torque ripple, while the two pumps that were operating normally had the smaller torque signature. As a result of this testing, a diver was sent into the pit and found that the bolts on one end-bell had rusted off, allowing the flute that directed water into the pump to fall off. This situation caused the pump to circulate water outside the pump and created cavitation. Bolts on the other pumps were also in need of replacement and would have failed in the near future. The downtime required to make the repairs cost the facility several million dollars, but the increased productivity after the repairs easily compensated for those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, dynamic motor testing and the state-of-the-art equipment available today are rapidly becoming the tools of choice for reliability technicians worldwide. The technology is quite young, and new innovations are continuously expanding its capabilities and horizons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/n5rb3KB_7vY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New SmartMotor Brings Combitronic Capability to Wet Environments</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/6/28/51e9363e-8da4-4d71-8b4e-d92148f05b79_Animatics Smart Motor.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 218px; float: left;" /&gt;Animatics&amp;rsquo; new SM23165MT-IP SmartMotor with mil-style connectors offers IP65 ratings with the convenience of a smaller frame size for compact applications. The second in a series of harsh environment-rated products from Animatics, the SM23165MT-IP combines the quality and capabilities of the SmartMotor integrated servo in combination with an IP65 rating. The sturdy design and thicker motor casing provide protection and durability, as well as resist cable stresses, meaning a longer motor life and less down time. Now any factory process using washdown techniques or wet processing environments can benefit from the easily programmable SmartMotor and its unique features such as Combitronic communication protocol and stand-alone linear interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Lubricant Market Expands to Wind Turbines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Global lubricant demand is forecast to reach 40.5 million metric tons in 2012. According to a recent study, the market is estimated at $48.8 billion. Companies in this booming market are expanding their lubricant lines to include those for more industries such as wind. Wind equipment requires specialized lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, they may require certain blends of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings in wind-power stations. One trend has been toward reducing maintenance costs and simplifying lubrication routines in the nacelle. Also, as wind turbines are built higher and in more extreme conditions, the trends is toward using low-viscosity lubricants to address cold weather effects, produce more power, and decrease micropitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, engineers are using specialty synthetics instead of mineral oils, along with particle counters to control contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To reduce maintenance costs and simplify lubrication in the nacelle, operators are using one lubricant for all bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Repairs on wind turbines can be costly, difficult, and dangerous,&amp;rdquo; says Jesse Dilk, wind industry manager at Kl&amp;uuml;ber. &amp;ldquo;Therefore, it is vital to use high-quality components at every opportunity. Bearings, seals, and lubricants are essential design elements when analyzing mechanical systems. Optimizing these elements leads to a more efficient, reliable machine design.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, Kl&amp;uuml;ber&amp;rsquo;s high-performance grease has a blend of base oil and additives to cover different lubrication requirements of individual bearings. Another adhesive grease lubricates gears in pitch and yaw drives, while reducing the risk of migration inside the nacelle and onto the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, the industry has moved toward using synthetics instead of mineral oils to minimize maintenance. &amp;ldquo;The lubricants tend to be well balanced, and have been widely tested in laboratory rigs and in the field,&amp;rdquo; Dilk says. &amp;ldquo;The preference for synthetics include high wear protection, higher efficiency from lower friction, and a wide operating temperature range. Specialty synthetic lubricants typically outperform mineral-based versions under the same conditions. Synthetics are further driven by a requirement for extended lubrication intervals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Exxon Mobil Corp. engineers also say synthetic gear oil protects against micropitting, scuffing wear, and corrosion. Synthetic oils function over a wide temperature range and resist deposit formation. Furthermore, many new lubricants and greases extend oil change intervals from a matter of months to years, which significantly reduces time and cost of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shell Lubricants also says it recognizes the significance of reduced reliability and demands of operating wind farms in remote locations (on and offshore) and in harsh climates. Their engineers have developed a variety of lubricants to withstand extremely low temperatures and protect against micropitting and bearing wear. Another trend is to monitor the oil conditions, especially in gearboxes. Shell, for example, offers an oil-analysis program that can help operators monitor the condition of their lubricant along with equipment that helps avoid unscheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, particle counters, such as those from Parker Hannifin Corp., provide contamination control for lubricants. Such units independently monitor system contamination trends, and give early warnings. LEDs or digital displays indicate low, medium, and high contamination levels. Such advancements, keep oil clean and increase its lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/7HwL8cGG9wM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>YRC Worldwide Launches Initiatives to Reduce Emissions, Cut Costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	YRC Worldwide announced several sustainability initiatives, including low-viscosity engine oil, trailer skirts, and optimizing its network.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;!stop&gt;This month, YRC Worldwide begins its shift to 5W full-synthetic motor oil, which will improve the fuel efficiency of the company&amp;#39;s fleet and reduce waste motor oil.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;When fully implemented in 2012, this change will translate to an annual savings of approximately 100,000 gallons of fuel,&amp;quot; said Mike Kelley, chief sustainability officer and vice president, external affairs. &amp;quot;In addition, this will reduce the waste oil we dispose of each year by approximately 28,000 fewer gallons.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company also is adding wind skirts to its 53-foot trailers, which will reduce drag to improve fuel economy. Concentrating initially on equipment in California, YRC Worldwide will extend the use of wind skirts nationwide. YRC Worldwide introduced its use of fuel-efficient tires in early 2010. Additionally, the company will order an initial SmartWay-certified power unit to use in a pilot program this summer.&lt;br /&gt;
	YRC Worldwide will also be hiring additional network engineers in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Network engineers are skilled in finding ways to optimize our network to minimize empty miles and maximize trailer capacity,&amp;quot; Kelley said. &amp;quot;Our network design works in tandem with our fleet enhancements, driving further reductions in emissions.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The efforts at becoming greener and more efficient are intended to help return the beleaguered company to profitability. Last quarter, the $4.3 billion company posted a $102 million loss. The company also plans to complete a financial restructuring this summer.&lt;/!stop&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/HgCaj8VZVuA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Valvoline Launches New Line of Recycled Oil</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A couple of years ago, a little-known American motor lubricant firm called Safety Kleen introduced its first-ever range of completely recycled mineral motor oil. Eco-Power represents a new direction in which engine oil will actually be reused rather than ending up being wasted or causing soil pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crucially though, the recycled engine oil goes through the same processes as virgin oil would undergo to end up as automobile lubricants fit for use in today&amp;rsquo;s high performance automobiles. Also, the recycled engine oil has been scientifically tested to meet all the requirements of the conventionally produced engine oil, thus making a very convincing case for itself. Taking this movement further into the mainstream is the American lube giant, Valvoline, which is much more known and visible both to motorists as well as auto manufacturers alike than Safety Kleen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Barely a month ago, Valvoline launched a new line of motor oil called NextGen, with a recycled oil content of 50%. This, in a way represents a sneak peek into the future of engine oils as a well-known lube giant like Valvoline using recycled oil to make perfectly fine motor oil is something that could only be followed by other well-known engine oil makers like Shell, Castrol, Amsoil and Motul. This recycled engine oil could be the new mantra of used engine oil, thus making our planet a cleaner, greener and happier place to live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/TBIJfMDfaCc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ashless extreme pressure additive offered for greases</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	By Thomas J. Karol, Ph.D. and Ronald J. Tepper, Ph. D. (Senior Chemist), &lt;a class="sm1" href="mailto:SDonnelly@rtvanderbilt.com"&gt;Steven G. Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; (Manager of Technical Services)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The R.T. Vanderbilt Company is commercially offering a new ashless extreme pressure (EP) additive (VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972) for greases and certain glycol fluids.&amp;nbsp; The material is a proprietary additive with patent pending. Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 is aimed at being environmentally friendly with cost effectiveness equivalent to the heavy metal EP additives in use today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The new additive is a &amp;quot;readily&amp;quot; biodegradable liquid material that affords high Timken pass values and four ball weld results with 1.5 to 2% additive treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Theory of Thiadiazoles as EP additives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Thiadiazole dimer technology (VANLUBE 829) has been used successfully in grease, which requires high load carrying properties as measured by the Four-Ball EP Test (ASTM 2596). The weld point reported in this test is the lowest applied load at which the sliding steel-on-steel surfaces seize and then weld. Most greases weld at between 126 kgf to 160 kgf while grease treated with 2.0 mass percent VANLUBE 829 will reach 250 kgf and sometimes 315 kgf; at 3.0 mass percent a 620 kgf weld point is possible. On occasion, we have been able to obtain the maximum 800 kgf loading without seizure.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We believe a possible explanation of why this additive can sustain such high loads and prevent steel-on-steel seizure is the ability to complex to the metal surface. Thiadiazole monomer technology (VANLUBE 871) is an effective antiwear additive in motor oils but doesn&amp;rsquo;t demonstrate the EP properties of the dimer technology. This suggests that the dimer technology affords a &amp;quot;bidentate coordination&amp;quot; (meaning &amp;quot;two teeth&amp;quot;) on the metal surface. The fact that the mono thiadiazoles afford only wear protection, supports the &amp;quot;bidentate coordination&amp;quot; as a reasonable explanation of the improved metal coordination that would be necessary for high load (or EP) protection. We believe that the pseudo aromatic nature of the ring allows &lt;font face="Symbol"&gt;p&lt;/font&gt; -complexation with the metal surface. The following structure depicts our visualization of how the ring could orientate planar to the metal and affect a double complexation or bidentate effect. In this light either ring&amp;rsquo;s decomplexation with the metal surface, does not eliminate the material from the metal surface.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Next Generation Thiadiazole Technology (thiadiazole dimer bridging)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The R.T. VANDERBILT research group set about to improve the ability of the thiadiazole technology to coordinate with metal surface thereby improving EP properties:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obtain a liquid product&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase the Timken OK load (versus VANLUBE 829)&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain good 4 ball EP test performance&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obtain an environmentally friendly product (ashless, biodegradable)&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cost effective versus metal technology&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our new grease technology &lt;b&gt;(Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972)&lt;/b&gt; consists of a complex between the 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMTD) disulfide dimer and butoxytriglycol and obtains all of these above goals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972: Thiadiazole / Glycol Complex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The pure disulfide dimer of DMTD (VANLUBE 829) shows excellent four ball weld properties. However, the product is a solid material with relatively low Timken values. We have recently found that the complex between the solid material and butoxytriglycol is an easily handled liquid with excellent Timken and 4-Ball Wear values and has been found to be biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It is believed that the improved extreme pressure properties are due to coordination between the thiadiazole bis dimer and butoxytriglycol which affords a bridging capable of many thiadiazole rings interacting with the surface but still linked by the glycol interaction between dimers. This affords a polydentate (versus a bidentate of the simple dimer) surface interaction. The butoxytriglycol bis DMTD derivative multiple association has a maximized surface interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Physical Evidence of Bridging dimer Thiadiazole Technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Performance is the most compelling evidence. The liquid complex Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 can obtain 80-pound Timken with 400 kgf 4-ball EP at very low levels (1-2%). To obtain this with metal technology took about 5%. If you were to evaluate the individual components of the dimer thiadiazole-glycol complex, the glycol has essentially no EP performance while the dimer thiadiazole performs exceptionally only in the 4-ball-EP test (not the Timken). The complex at the minimized treatment level (1-2%) which still obtains the maximum OK Timken Load result (80 pound Timken possible) produces a 4-ball EP test result of 315-400 kgf (typical). It is clear that this concentration level (thiadiazole is about 40% of VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972) of dimer thiadiazole (without the glycol bridge) would produce lower 4-ball-EP test results (VANLUBE 829 @ 0.5% in a Lithium grease gave 215 kgf 4-ball EP test) and a very low Timken result (~ 20-30 pound).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The maximum load carrying performance of VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 is at least an 80 pound Timken (maximum attempted due to variability in test) and a 400 kgf 4-ball EP test (although reached at 1-2%, evaluated to 5%).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Major shifts in IR absorption peaks&lt;/b&gt; are further evidence for the complex formation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="4"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;font color="#e1995f" face="arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font color="#e1995f" face="arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absorption Peaks (cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;

				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;DMTD disulfide bis-dimer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1499, 1472, 1447, 1382, 1268, 1232, 1112 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;Triethylene glycol monobutyl ether&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1460, 1351, 1297, 1248&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

		&lt;tr align="right"&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;Complex, disulfide bis-dimer&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

			&lt;td align="left"&gt;
				&lt;font face="arial" size="2"&gt;1510, 1433, 1350, 1244&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additional evidence of true complexation of glycols to dimer thiadiazoles is shown by the interaction with the glycol as measured by simple solubility. Dimer thiadiazoles have little interaction with most solvents as seen by their saturation point in that solvent. Higher interactions would be seen by more solvation, which would be evident by higher levels dissolving (again higher interaction). The solvolysis/complexation is evidence of this higher interaction. We believe that the glycol must have the ability to coordinate with two dimer molecules to function a chain link in the complex and afford the EP properties.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Formation of the complex frequently requires heating to approximately 130&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;C. Stirring indefinitely at room temperature will not dissolve the solid thiadiazole derivative in the glycol.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Copper to Gold&lt;/b&gt; color changes (1a- 2e) occur on copper strip. This is the &amp;quot;typical thiadiazole coating&amp;quot; with the vast majority of 1,3,4-thiadiazole analogs. Air exposed copper (versus &amp;quot;freshly polished&amp;quot;) demonstrates a 1a color. Thiadiazole exposed copper demonstrates a gold color metal would be rated 2e. Test were conducted to determine if this color change was a protective coat or corrosion of the copper metal.&lt;br /&gt;

	Results indicate that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 does not corrode copper but coats the metal with a film. Most of the film can be removed with acetone and a paper towel. Acetone is highly polar and coordinates well with the metal sites and still some thiadiazole coordination remains.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We wished to test if this coating was &amp;quot;protective&amp;quot; to corrosion by treating the copper with lubricant with copper corrosive additive alone and compare that to the corrosive additive with the Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 thiadiazole present.&lt;br /&gt;

	Results indicate that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 protects against copper corrosion. Molybdenum dithiophosphate shows a weight loss with a high degree of darkening (4a). Molybdenum dithiophosphate shows no corrosion with VANLUBE&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 as seen by a weight gain and the characteristic gold color (2e) formed.&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;b class="col_4"&gt;Improving Wear Scar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most EP additives do have some effect on the wear scar of the lubricant. Since they have a high metal interaction, one might expect some degree of &amp;quot;corrosive&amp;quot; effect on the metal. This could explain the higher wear scar seen in a grease treated with Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 (versus the base grease) in the Shell 4-ball wear test.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In a second aluminum complex grease, it was found that the Timken properties, 4-Ball Wear properties, and the 4-Ball Weld properties are improved in the presence of the rust inhibitor, OD-9316 (&lt;font face="Times"&gt;USP 5,599,779&lt;/font&gt;; material available from R.T. VANDERBILT Co).&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;br /&gt;
	One standard test method for determining aerobic biodegradation of lubricants and their components is the Gledhill Shake flask ASTM method D-6139-97. This test method was used for evaluating the biodegradation of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972. Doses of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 were subjected to the conditions of the test, and there appeared to be a dose-related response. The percent degradation was measured by the amount of carbon dioxide produced versus the theoretical amount. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; that formed was determined by reaction of carbon dioxide with barium hydroxide, which forms barium carbonate as the product:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;nbsp;appears that the higher levels of glycol diminish the bacterial activity. This would be expected from the biodegradation of the glycol itself where it is stated &amp;quot;biodegradable in low levels&amp;quot;. The biodegradation of Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 was compared with the percent biodegradation of sodium benzoate and canola oil, which are known to have very high biodegradation and are typically used as standards. We were very delighted that Vanlube&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 972 (at low levels) is &amp;quot;readily&amp;quot; biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Automotive industry pursuing new technology, techniques</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MarketResearch.com has announced the addition of GBI Research&amp;#39;s new report &amp;quot;Lubricants Industry to 2015 - Surge in Automotive Market in Emerging Economies Driving Demand,&amp;quot; to their collection of Chemicals market reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the report, the global automotive industry is back on the growth path after the setback caused by the financial crisis of 2009. The industry is now actively pursuing innovative new technologies, production and business techniques. Although it is on a growth path, the fact remains that it will take a long time for it to recover, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asia has recovered well as compared to the West, and this is reflected in the growing automobile numbers. China, the world&amp;#39;s largest automotive market, showed a more than 20% growth in December 2010. China and India seem to have weathered the financial crisis storm, compensating for the decline in lubricant demand in the rest of the world. In 2009, these countries took over the automotive production leadership position, with over 14 million units -- a surge of more than 48% over 2008 -- and well over 10 million more than the total production of the US, Canada, and Mexico combined. In India, the production growth was less dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ceramic bearings designed for the food processing industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings has introduced&amp;nbsp;its new and expanded line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and specialty lubricates specifically designed for the food processing and food packaging industries. Some of the most pressing issues facing the food manufacturing industry today are controlling costs and food safety. Full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings are capable of alleviating some of these concerns. Ceramic balls are far more efficient than steel balls because the rolling surface is more spherically perfect and therefore reduces friction. Companies that converted to ceramic bearings have seen a decrease of energy consumption and were therefore able to cut cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ceramic in ball form is twice the Rockwell hardness of steel which results in a more durable and longer lasting bearing. Boca Bearings line of full ceramic and ceramic hybrid bearings are appropriate for use in food packaging and food processing due to their ability to work in challenging conditions. Ceramic materials can operate in extreme temperatures, work with heavy loads and will not corrode or rust when exposed to water, alkali or acids, as might be customary during food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Boca Bearings also offers a line of traditional lubrication, solid lubrication and dry lubrication that are FDA approved for food manufacturing facilities. For example Boca&amp;rsquo;s exclusive Ultra Dry Lube (UDL) is an extensively modified Lamellar composition that adds less than half a micron to any metal substrate. UDL molecularly bonds to most materials and is inorganic, non-toxic, non-corrosive and resistant to most fuels, solvents and acids present in food processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further Boca Bearings offers the Lightning Solid Lube (LSL) line of solid Polyethylene and Graphite lubricants. LSL Poly lube, available in food grade and non food grade, is excellent for continuous operating temperatures up to 93&amp;deg;C (200&amp;deg;F) that can drastically increase bearing life and eliminate dripping oil or grease. LSL Graphite lube can be used in extreme operating temperatures from -157&amp;deg;C (-250 &amp;deg;F) to 349&amp;deg;C (660&amp;deg;F); Graphite Lube is insoluble in most organic solutions and will not wash out in water, steam or chemical wash down procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Bearing protection rings help cement plant boost uptime</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It seemed as though nothing could stop the squealing. Not that the Monarch Cement Company&amp;rsquo;s huge ball mill wasn&amp;rsquo;t already loud. Powered by a 5,000-horsepower motor, it pulverizes 100 tons of clinker (a burned mixture of limestone and shale) per hour. But the squealing was not what Randy Riebel wanted to hear. As electrical supervisor at Monarch&amp;rsquo;s plant in Humboldt, Kan., he knew the noise meant the motor&amp;rsquo;s bearings were going &amp;ndash; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the sound of chronic bearing damage was all too familiar at the plant, which has the capacity to produce 1.3 million tons of cement a year. Since 2001, when the ball mill was new, its motor bearings had been replaced three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We kept greasing those bearings, but they kept on squealing,&amp;rdquo; Riebel recalls. &amp;ldquo;We knew that if we waited too long, the bearing race walls would become fluted like they had in the past, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to another replacement because of all the expense and downtime. It takes at least 10 days to pull that motor &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a major production. Sometimes we have to hire help, rent a hoist to put it on a truck and take it away to be rebuilt. So this time (summer of 2009), I decided to try something else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;something else&amp;rdquo; was the AEGIS iPRO Bearing Protection Ring, manufactured by Maine-based Electro Static Technology (EST). By safely channeling harmful electrical currents away from bearings to ground, the iPRO extends the lives of medium-voltage motors and generators, thus improving the reliability of entire systems in which they are used. It is available in a range of sizes to accommodate generator/motor shafts up to 30 inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance-free, the AEGIS iPRO is ideal for medium-voltage motors that drive pumps, compressors, mixers, shredders, conveyors and other machinery used in mining, food processing, wastewater treatment, petrochemical refining and many other high-current applications. The iPRO also protects the bearings of generators in both utility and on-site power generation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel had been discussing electrical bearing damage with Scott Wilkins, manager of motor shop operations for Independent Electric Machinery Company (IEMCO), a local motor and equipment repair shop. Wilkins recommended the iPRO, and Riebel had IEMCO install two of them on the ball mill motor. While for most large motors EST recommends installing an iPRO in the drive end and insulation on the non-drive end, for some large motors &amp;ndash; especially those that do not have insulation designed into them or where insulation cannot be easily installed &amp;ndash; EST recommends installing iPRO rings at both the drive end and the non-drive end of the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel and Wilkins chose the iPRO split-ring model, which is designed to facilitate field retrofits. The mating halves of each iPRO were installed around the motor shaft without the need to decouple the motor from the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A family-owned business founded in 1906, IEMCO sells, services, repairs and tests motors, generators, hoists, welders and electrical distribution switchgear. IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s main office in Kansas City, Kan., has a fully equipped machine shop. The company also has five other service centers in the region. Because they deal with large motors routinely, IEMCO&amp;rsquo;s personnel are well aware of the severe damage shaft currents can cause to motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mitigating Electrical Bearing Damage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If not diverted, shaft voltages can discharge through bearings, pitting the balls and race walls. Without long-term bearing protection, concentrated pitting at regular intervals along a race wall can cause washboard-like ridges called fluting, a source of noise and vibration. The eventual result is motor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ironically, some products designed to protect bearings, such as conventional spring-loaded grounding brushes, require extensive maintenance themselves. Others, such as insulation and ceramic bearings, can shift damage to connected equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To boost the electron-transfer rate, the iPRO&amp;rsquo;s entire inner circumference is lined with multiple rows of conductive microfibers. Locked securely in the ring&amp;rsquo;s patented AEGIS FiberLock channel, these microfibers completely surround the motor shaft, providing millions of discharge points for harmful shaft currents and creating the path of least resistance that effectively diverts these currents away from bearings to ground. The microfibers themselves are specially engineered for exceptional flexibility to prevent breakage and ensure that the ring will last for the life of the motor. Because it prolongs the life of bearings, motors, and motor-driven systems, the iPRO qualifies as sustainable technology under the Federal Energy Management Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nagging, Widespread Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Contractors and retail home-improvement stores in six Midwestern states depend on the Monarch plant, which sends cement by truck and train to its terminals in Des Moines, Iowa, and Dodge City, Kan. The terminals distribute the cement to 13 Monarch subsidiaries, which sell it in their respective areas. Some of the cement is sold in bulk, some in bags. And, some of it is further processed by the subsidiaries, which fabricate building products or add stone and sand to produce ready-mix concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Monarch was founded in 1908, chunks of blasted limestone (&amp;ldquo;shot rock&amp;rdquo;) up to 4 feet across were loaded by hand into mule-drawn carts. Now this limestone is moved by huge front-end loaders, 50-ton dump trucks and conveyors to be processed by a series of computer-controlled crushers, kilns and mills until it is as fine as face powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the processing machinery is powered by electric motors and the problem of chronic bearing damage is by no means limited to the plant&amp;rsquo;s ball mills. Many of the motors are controlled by variable frequency drives (VFDs), which induce additional high-frequency currents on motor shafts. A fan or pump motor tends to use less power if the input is modulated by a VFD, but the benefits of improved efficiency are lost if the motor keeps breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such breakdownswere recurring headaches for Riebel, but because the two AEGIS iPRO rings installed in 2009 appear to be protecting the bearings of the ball-mill motor, he has since had IEMCO install the iPRO on nine more motors that had to be removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A case in point is a VFD-controlled cooler-vent fan where the 300-HP motor had to be replaced frequently for almost eight years. Every time, the kiln had to be shut down for at least a day. The old motor was removed, and the rebuilt spare motor had to be aligned and coupled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d send the pulled motor out to be rebuilt, but then three to six months later we&amp;rsquo;d have to do the same thing all over again,&amp;rdquo; says Riebel. &amp;ldquo;For the cooler vent fan motor we tried insulation on both bearings. With the insulation, the motor lasted two years between breakdowns. The shunted electricity might have hurt the bearings in the fan itself. Insulation just pushes the problem on down the line. The electricity has got to go somewhere if it&amp;rsquo;s not grounded. The iPRO has given this fan a fresh start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t really realize what the problem was,&amp;rdquo; Riebel reflects. &amp;ldquo;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much information available about electrical bearing damage. We just knew that bearings would fail and the motor would overheat, but we were not looking to see why. Again and again, we just sent the motor out, got it rebuilt, and put it back in service. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know the root cause.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solved by an Innovative, Green Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is now Monarch policy to have IEMCO add the iPRO ring in the shop whenever a VFD-controlled Monarch fan motor is overhauled.Another such installation was on the 2,250-horsepower motor for an ID (induced-draft) fan that pulls kiln-heated air through a roller mill, to dry the limestone and shale during the raw grinding process. Other motors that now have iPROs include four at the plant&amp;rsquo;s kilns, where air is forced in and out: two 2,000-HP ID fan motors and two 1,000-HP baghouse (dust-collecting) fan motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, because a cement plant is a very dusty place and many motors are outdoors, Monarch has begun to specify that some of its new motors must come equipped with theAEGIS Severe-Duty SGR Bearing Isolator Shaft Grounding Ring, another Electro Static Technology product. As in the iPRO, the secured conductive microfibers of the AEGIS Severe-Duty SGR completely surround the motor shaft for efficient grounding, but this model has a built-in IP56 noncontact isolation seal to provide extra protection from dust, water, and other contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Monarch&amp;rsquo;s maintenance manager, Mark Pily, authorized the purchase of the plant&amp;rsquo;s first motor with a factory-installed Severe-Duty SGR, after consultingIEMCO&amp;rsquo;s Wilkins. As of this writing, a 200-HP air-compressor motor is the only such motor in operation at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We want to keep the bearings clean because we push that motor really hard,&amp;rdquo; Riebel explains. &amp;ldquo;We usually lose that motor because of winding failure. I think most of that is caused by the bearings starting to fail, which causes the motor to overload.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Ounce of Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Using a voltage probe and oscilloscope, Riebel periodically takes shaft voltage readings on all the plant&amp;rsquo;s motors with grounding rings. He is pleased with the results because the readings are low, indicating that the rings have reduced potentially damaging shaft voltages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Riebel also gives a high grade to the service the plant has received from IEMCO: &amp;ldquo;In my opinion, they are by far the best shop we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with, and we&amp;rsquo;ve worked with most every shop in the area. Scott (Wilkins) is really involved. He&amp;rsquo;s really a get-it-right-the-first-time kind of person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Time will tell exactly how much money the rings will save Monarch overall, but Riebel is convinced the AEGIS iPRO provides effective, long-term bearing protection that reduces the costs of downtime and motor maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;So far, so good,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;On the 5,000-horsepower, since the last set of bearings only lasted a year, chances are we would have noticed problems by now, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t had any &amp;ndash; no squealing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Infrastructure, energy sectors propel medium-voltage AC drives market growth</title>
            <description>&lt;div class="ExternalClass4BF26D651D9B46EB89658B885C83194F"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		As global financial stability is being restored, the medium-voltage AC drives market is expected to have steady growth during the forecast period through 2015 due to robust investments in the energy sectors and infrastructure industries worldwide. According to a new ARC Advisory Group study, in advanced and emerging economies, infrastructure development will continue as a significant portion of government stimulus funding directed toward those industries.&amp;nbsp;As the economy continues to recover, globalization will spur more capital investments in various industries, such as oil &amp;amp; gas, water &amp;amp; wastewater, electric power, building automation, and metals &amp;amp; mining, driven by the growing demand for improved infrastructures as well as energy savings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;img align="right" alt="Medium" border="0" hspace="5" src="http://www.arcweb.com/momag/graph-acmed-cr.gif" vspace="5" /&gt;&amp;ldquo;The market for medium-voltage AC drives will be driven largely by the significant global consumption occurring in the power generation, oil &amp;amp; gas, and metals &amp;amp; mining industries,&amp;rdquo; according to senior analyst &lt;a href="mailto:hshah@arcweb.com"&gt;Himanshu Shah&lt;/a&gt;, the principal author of ARC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.arcweb.com/Research/Studies/Pages/AC-Drives-Medium-Voltage.aspx"&gt;Medium-Voltage AC Drives Worldwide Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Investments in Infrastructure Will Drive Market Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Globalization has created a growing demand for modern infrastructures, especially in emerging economies. Major investments are underway and more are being planned for airport facilities, railway and public transportation expansions, and new road construction, which are driving demand for products from the metals &amp;amp; mining, cement &amp;amp; glass, and oil &amp;amp; gas industries.&amp;nbsp;Emerging economies know that their current infrastructures are a major bottleneck for their continuing economic growth.&amp;nbsp;Medium-voltage AC drives are one of the critical components for these infrastructure investments and are used extensively in these industries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		With the beginning of the current economic recovery, the globalization environment is expected to resume.&amp;nbsp;The beginnings of a modest recovery in the global economy presents an excellent backdrop for medium voltage AC drives&amp;rsquo; market growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Emerging economies, such as China, India, Brazil and many of the eastern European countries, are facing a scarcity of energy and have inadequate infrastructures, such as water &amp;amp; wastewater facilities, due to their rising middle class and population growth. Most developed countries are facing deteriorating infrastructures, many of which are in critical need of modernization. Under such circumstances, medium voltage AC drives are expected to experience continuing growth in 2011 and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		China&amp;rsquo;s market has been the fastest growing region due to heavy domestic demand for medium-voltage AC drives from many growing industries as well as the state&amp;rsquo;s energy-saving initiatives. The markets in central &amp;amp; eastern Europe, Russia and India are also expected to grow rapidly as a result of ongoing industry expansion in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		While every world region will experience growth in the medium-voltage AC drives market over the forecast period, there are significantly different factors affecting each specific market.&amp;nbsp;A brief description regarding the economic scenarios for each major world area is covered in this report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		In addition to the quantitative assessment of the medium-voltage AC drives market, the report provides an insightful analysis of the market and strategies of the leading suppliers that will impact this business in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ABB to acquire Baldor Electric in $4.2 billion transaction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ABB, a leading power and automation technology group, and Baldor Electric Company, a North American leader in industrial motors, have agreed that ABB will acquire Baldor in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $4.2 billion, including $1.1 billion of net debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the definitive agreement, which has been unanimously approved by both companies&amp;rsquo; Boards of Directors, ABB will commence a tender offer to purchase all of Baldor&amp;rsquo;s outstanding shares for $63.50 per share in cash. The transaction represents a 41 percent premium to Baldor&amp;rsquo;s closing stock price on November 29, 2010. The board of directors of Baldor will recommend that Baldor shareholders tender their shares in the tender offer. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction closes a gap in ABB&amp;rsquo;s automation portfolio in North America by adding Baldor&amp;rsquo;s strong NEMA motors product line and positions the company as a market leader for industrial motors, including high-efficiency motors. Baldor also adds a growing and profitable mechanical power transmission business to ABB&amp;rsquo;s portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The transaction will substantially improve ABB&amp;rsquo;s access to the industrial customer base in North America, opening opportunities for ABB&amp;rsquo;s wider portfolio including energy efficient drives and complementary motors. This move comes at a time when regulatory changes in the United States and other parts of the world will accelerate demand for energy efficient industrial motion products. The acquisition will strengthen ABB&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading supplier of industrial motion solutions, and will also enable ABB to tap the huge potential in North America for rail and wind investments, both of which are expected to grow rapidly in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Baldor is a great company with an extremely strong brand in the world&amp;rsquo;s largest industrial market,&amp;rdquo; said Joe Hogan, ABB&amp;rsquo;s CEO. &amp;ldquo;Baldor&amp;rsquo;s product range and regional scope are highly complementary to ours and give both companies significant opportunities to deliver greater value to our customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	John McFarland, chairman of the board and CEO of Baldor, commented: &amp;ldquo;Our board of directors believes this transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders, our employees and our customers. It demonstrates the value our employees have created and the strength of our brand and products in the global motors industry. We are excited about the opportunity to join ABB&amp;rsquo;s worldwide family as we have always respected ABB. We are very pleased that ABB will locate its motor and generator business headquarters for North America in Fort Smith and we are confident that the combined global platform will be well positioned to capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities in the future.&amp;rdquo; John McFarland will stay with the combined business to support a successful integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;ABB is well known in the marketplace for premium, innovative and advanced products. We have respected them as both a market participant and a value-added supplier for many years,&amp;rdquo; said Ron Tucker, Baldor&amp;rsquo;s current president and chief operating officer, and CEO designate. Tucker will run Baldor, including the mechanical power transmission products business and ABB&amp;rsquo;s motor and generator business in North America, after the transaction is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Baldor is based in Fort Smith, Ark., and is a leading supplier in the large North American industrial motors industry. In addition, Baldor offers a broad range of mechanical power transmission products such as mounted bearings, enclosed gearing and couplings &amp;ndash; used primarily in process industries &amp;ndash; as well as drives and generators. The Baldor drives business will be combined with the larger ABB drives business to achieve even further penetration of this important product line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Baldor employs approximately 7,000 people and reported an operating profit of $184 million on revenue of $1.29 billion in first nine months of 2010. This represents an increase of 30 percent in operating profit and 11 percent in revenue over the comparable period in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The US market for high-efficiency motors is expected to grow 10 to15 percent in 2011 on the back of new regulations, effective in December this year. Similar regulations in Canada, Mexico and in the European Union are expected in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;ABB and Baldor will be able to offer our North American and global customers an unparalleled range of high-efficiency industrial products and services to help them meet their new demands,&amp;rdquo; said Ulrich Spiesshofer, executive committee member responsible for ABB&amp;rsquo;s Discrete Automation and Motion division, into which Baldor&amp;rsquo;s business will be integrated alongside the existing Motors and Generators business. &amp;ldquo;We expect to achieve over $200 million in annual synergies by 2015, consisting of more than $100 million annual cost synergies and at least the same global revenue synergies. We estimate two-thirds of these synergies will be realized by 2013. We intend to build on Baldor&amp;rsquo;s excellent North American position to sell energy efficient drives, larger motors and generators. Together, we will accelerate the expansion of Baldor&amp;rsquo;s mechanical power transmission product portfolio into the global process automation market using ABB&amp;rsquo;s strong channels in this sector.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are deeply impressed by the skill and passion of the Baldor team and their excellent customer relationships,&amp;rdquo; Spiesshofer said. &amp;ldquo;The strength of Baldor&amp;rsquo;s people and executive team, which will continue under the new ownership, will play a key role in our mutual success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the terms of the merger agreement, the transaction is structured as a cash tender offer to be followed as soon as possible by a merger. The tender offer is expected to commence in December and is subject to customary terms and conditions, including the tender of at least two-thirds of Baldor&amp;#39;s shares on a fully diluted basis, and regulatory clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Citi served as financial advisor to ABB and UBS Investment Bank served as financial advisor to Baldor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB is a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility and industry customers to improve their performance while lowering environmental impact. The ABB Group of companies operates in around 100 countries and employs about 117,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Baldor Electric Company markets, designs and manufactures industrial electric motors, mechanical power transmission products, drives and generators. Baldor employs approximately 7,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/gY-bpyZi140" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How a Nucor mill benefits from condition monitoring</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the last several years, Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s integrated monitoring and diagnostics solution has been applied extensively at Nucor Steel&amp;rsquo;s Hickman Sheet Mill. Automated data collection has been introduced and applied in concert with established traditional manual condition monitoring programs at the mill. Data collected from both methods is interpreted and displayed via a single Web portal and diagnostics are performed remotely by Azima analysts. This article describes the justification, development, application and benefits of such an integrated solution. Specific case studies will be presented along with discussions of deployment issues and barriers that have been overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Condition Monitoring Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Condition monitoring, commonly referred to as predictive maintenance, is a proven approach to improving reliability and productivity in industry. Its underlying philosophy is that technology can be used to measure and evaluate the condition of plant assets and equipment, thus enabling intelligent decisions to be made about maintenance activity. In this manner, maintenance is applied to the assets that need attention, while those whose performance and condition are determined to be normal are left alone to perform productive roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The initial application of condition monitoring was in the utility and petrochemical industries in the 1970s. During this period, tremendous plant expansions and constructions were taking place, and plant scale increased dramatically. Instead of being dependent on many small machines, plant train size and capacity were such that a typical refinery or large generating plant became absolutely dependent on a very few, very large and very expensive capital machines. The loss of one of these capital assets (primarily rotating machinery) to mechanical failure could (and did) result in major income losses and, in the case of some the larger petrochemical plants, actual disruptions in markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This reality resulted in the development of fault protection systems (warning/trip systems based on vibration analysis) for protecting rotating capital machinery from catastrophic failure. These fault protection systems proved very successful in preventing crashes and limiting the damage from machine failure. These systems were soon institutionalized and standards (API, etc.) were developed and accepted throughout the appropriate industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the success of fault protection systems, many plant operators began to suspect that similar approaches could be applied to the myriad of smaller machines in the plant. Even though the failure of one of these smaller machines could not itself shut down a plant, the aggregate cost of repairs on these machines made the application of condition monitoring an attractive prospect in a typical refinery or chemical plant. However, the high per-machine cost of applying a fault protection system prohibited this from becoming a reality. Instead, technology responded with the development of portable measurement instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning with simple meters, manual log sheets and trending, machine surveillance programs were born. Beginning in the late 1980s, the explosion of PC/computer technology drove the development of computerized manual data collection systems which rapidly gained success in the plant maintenance market. In very short order, the use of &amp;ldquo;data collector&amp;rdquo; systems &amp;ndash; programmable black boxes with well-defined measurement capabilities &amp;ndash; spread to many industries, including the steel industry. A &amp;ldquo;route&amp;rdquo; defining the machines to be measured and the specific measurements to be taken was created in PC-based software and downloaded to the data collector. Personnel would go out into the plant to collect data with the device and then upload the data. This data would then be analyzed and a report was issued recommending appropriate maintenance actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through the tremendous advances in data processing technology, these so-called &amp;ldquo;walk-around systems&amp;rdquo; have progressed to the point where the limit is no longer measurement technology. Megabytes of machine condition data can be gathered in a day, with relatively low skill requirements. This approach represents the status quo to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Contentional&amp;rsquo; Walk-around Data Collection &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Current data collector systems are very powerful and represent near-miraculous improvements over the initial 1980s systems. Modern data collectors are intended primarily to collect rotating machinery vibration data (although other scalar and non-dynamic data, including manual observations and comments can typically be entered). The accompanying software enables the presentation of the collected data for analysis. This software typically supports the incorporation of other external data, such as infrared thermography and lubricant analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a typical EAF/mini-mill environment, the actual execution and responsibility for such a walk-around vibration program resides either in-house or with outside contract resources. A typical AF/mini-mill with an associated cold mill may have 500 to 600 individual machines under monitoring/surveillance via data collector/walk-around methods, with somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 individual measurements being taken each month. This represents, under typical conditions, about one to two man-weeks of measurement effort alone. Data analysis typically consumes another man-week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s manual data collector systems have reached a near-zenith in efficiency. Early on (late 1980s), processing technology in microprocessors and memory limited their performance and, depending on the measurements to be taken, the technician analyst was often waiting for the data collector to do a given task. As such, his efficiency was limited. Processing technology today has advanced to the point where the required sample times and the fundamental mathematics of data digitization are the time limit, rather than the performance of hardware and software. It is not reasonable to expect any significant gains in terms of data collection time due to measurement technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a manual data collection program, achieving a load factor (time spent actually taking measurements as opposed to traveling from point to point, uploading and downloading data, etc.) of 60 to 70 percent is a significant achievement. It is not unusual for the data collection portion of a condition monitoring to consume 70 percent or more of recurring operating/labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data collection is, of course, only part of the process of executing a successful condition monitoring program. Data analysis, screening processes and reporting are essential to achieving cost reductions and improvements in uptime. In most cases, the availability and skill of personnel with the proper experience and training are the governing factors in the success of a condition monitoring program. Collecting data is not hard; making the appropriate use of the data is much more difficult to achieve consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite very capable measurement technology, condition monitoring success in a given plant is still dependent on the ability to gather and correctly interpret data from the plant machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manual data collection processes, even in the presence of efficient data collection and skilled analysis, are still snapshot in nature and may not reflect the actual operating conditions that plant equipment experience. This is because there are more day-to-day variations in data than is revealed by a monthly collection route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Historically, the steel industry has been willing to adopt condition monitoring as a means of improving mill productivity, and many successful programs are extant in mills. Whether contracted out or executed in-house, the same issues governing successful implementation of a condition monitoring program exist. The most difficult issue is retention of the appropriate skills and experience in the condition monitoring role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to be successful an individual must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be very conversant with rotating machinery and machine components &amp;ndash; the individual has to understand couplings, bearings and gears, machine dynamics (at least at some basic level), and the factors that affect machine wear and tear.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be at least conversant with (or be able and willing to be trained in) more esoteric concepts like spectrum analysis, frequency analysis, phase, modulation, etc., and have sufficient understanding of some basic concepts that normally are not part of the vocabulary of an individual with the requisite mechanical skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be competent with computer technology, at least to the level of an advanced application user &amp;ndash; all of the current condition monitoring technologies involve computer usage to a very large degree.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be a skilled communicator. Clearly explaining the reasoning behind a given recommendation is a key and often overlooked requirement for a successful condition monitoring program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be willing (or have personnel that are willing) to routinely do hot, dirty, repetitive data collection work, that typically involves difficult-to-access or hazardous areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not hard to understand why maintaining the appropriate people resources, whether in-house or contracted out, is difficult to achieve over the long haul. In the developing years of condition monitoring technology (late 1970s to early 1990s), most plants, regardless of size, had one or two (sometimes many more) resources devoted to condition monitoring programs. This supply led to an effective &amp;ldquo;farm club&amp;rdquo; system that supplied experienced personnel to both the in-the-plant programs and outside contract/consultant sources. Changes in plant manning, personnel and position rotations, and retirements have resulted in a situation where the availability of such personnel is limited and shrinking, and the cost of those workers is rising. The decline in the availability of human resources with the appropriate experience and skill sets has led to the exploration of ways to bring the data to the analyst. In this manner, a person with the requisite skills can cover far more industrial real estate than would otherwise be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Remove Monitoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the late 1970s, adoption of automation for plant and process control and communication has risen substantially both in complexity and market acceptance. Computers on every desk and in every control room are now the norm. Mills and plants typically have very sophisticated and extensive IT networks for both administrative and process control/automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First approaches in many diverse industries involved transmission of machine-condition-related data to existing Man-Machine Interface (MMI)/Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems. Particularly, existing machinery protection (warning and trip) systems were tied into control room HMI/MMI interfaces so that operators could view vibration, temperature and other machine condition parameters. Typically, these were magnitude-only scalar values, which &amp;ndash; while valuable in terms of information and indication of possible machine problems &amp;ndash; were lacking in terms of trending, analysis and data interpretation capabilities. Plant personnel were thus receiving information that a given machine was vibrating more, or a bearing temperature was going up, etc. This left open the question of why these changes were occurring, and how the plant should react to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advances in technology, the Internet and the need to more efficiently monitor machinery with limited personnel drove the development of expanded remote monitoring systems. Rather than delivering machine data in-house only (to the control room, etc.), technology and the Internet enable information to be accessed from anywhere, anytime. This new method uses field-mounted sensing devices and instruments, some sort of aggregating devices, advanced software, and access to plant and external networks for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits of such a system are apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More frequent monitoring of machinery without a need for data collection/analysis personnel to be present, as well as the ability to observe dynamic changes in machine condition due to load, speed and operating conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to move data off-site for remote consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to have multiple resources in multiple locations looking at data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to monitor parameters other than what would normally be monitored in a traditional manual program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The ability to assess machine performance in terms of efficiency, throughput, etc., and relate that data to machine condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Condition Monitoring at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman has had a condition monitoring program in place for more than 10 years. The program was based around traditional manual survey methodology and techniques, and was provided by outside contract resources. Data was collected on equipment across the mill on a monthly basis, with frequent callouts for troubleshooting and analysis of specific problems. After data collection, analysis was performed and written reports with recommendations were disseminated to appropriate mill personnel. All systems in the mill (environmental, hot mill, casters and melt shop) were included. In 1998, Nucor Hickman added a cold mill facility, with pickling line, galvanizing line, RT mill and annealing capability. The traditional monitoring program was expanded (nearly doubled) to include this portion of the mill. After the integration of the cold mill into the program, 590 machines were under monthly surveillance. A typical survey required two to three man-weeks to complete by manual methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As early forms of remote data collection and analysis methods became available, opportunities rose where remote monitoring might be practical and beneficial. In the first case, caster mold water cooling pumps, which had traditionally been a maintenance problem, became a potential application due to changes in operating conditions. The mold water pump installation at Nucor Hickman at that point consisted of three 700-horsepower opposed suction centrifugal pumps, direct coupled to induction motor drivers. In typical operations, two pumps were in service and one maintained as in inline spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Operational requirements dictated a need for increased mold water flow, and all three pumps were placed in service. This had a negative impact in terms of pump vibration levels and reduced confidence in pump reliability. There was no remaining spare capacity (the standby pump was now in continuous service), making the impact of a pump failure significant. Nucor Hickman decided to apply some of the early remote, Internet-based monitoring technologies to the pumps. Expected benefits were closer-to-real-time problem detection and better understanding of the pumps&amp;rsquo; vibration behavior. In addition, a current sensor was added to the systems on each motor, which would allow monitoring of system load in parallel with pump and motor vibration on each of the pumps. The system would report bearing temperatures, vibration magnitudes, discharge pressures, current magnitudes and frequency content/time domain vibration data from each pump. This data was available to contractor analysis personnel, who were responsible for monitoring the pumps&amp;rsquo; behavior, and also to plant personnel. In addition, the data was available over the Web, making it accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection. Multiple users could access the system at the same time from multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Internet-based monitoring system was installed with data being collected much more frequently and under different operational conditions. Within days of commissioning the online remote system, it was obvious that the vibration behavior of the pumps varied much more widely than had been indicated by the once-per-month data. This is because monthly data &amp;ndash; even several years worth of it &amp;ndash; was simply insufficient to notice it. The frequent collection enabled by the automated system clearly showed 3:1 variations over different operational modes. In addition, load current data (which was not available from the traditional once/month data) indicated that the pumps were typically not loaded nearly to capacity, and were operating well off curve. As a result, an engineering study of the pump systems and operation was commissioned. The study concluded that sizing errors, control strategies and piping configurations were incorrect for the desired operating conditions. The pumps were resized and other changes were put in place to provide the desired increased flow. This provided spare capacity without the need to run all three pumps, and contributed materially to improved cooling and mold life. It is highly unlikely that these issues would have come to light without the data provided by the remote monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further applications of remote monitoring technology were installed on baghouse ID fans and utility air compressors in the hot mill. The hot mill air compressors are three-stage centrifugal machines, directly driven by two-pole induction motors. The compressors and motors were on monthly surveillance and were subject to frequent bearing failures in the drive motors. Once-per-month data was catching bearing failures often, but trends were erratic and no clear root cause was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When remote monitoring technology was applied, it became clear that &amp;ndash; as with the mold water pumps &amp;ndash; the vibration levels were varying much more than had been apparent from the monthly manual data. It was also clear that the variations had a pattern that closely tracked ambient temperatures. Since bearing temperatures also were being monitored, it was clear that when ambient temperature went up, vibration levels increased dramatically. Analysis of the frequency content provided by the remote monitoring system clearly indicated that the cause of the increase in vibration was imbalance in the motor rotors. Further review of bearing wear patterns indicated an extreme thrust load was being placed on the motor&amp;rsquo;s radial Conrad-type ball bearings. From this, it became apparent that at high temperatures the motor rotor was expanding axially and there was insufficient clearance in the motor bearing fits to allow for this expansion, causing rotor bow (hence the imbalance) and axial overload of the motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of this discovery, the compressor drive motors were replaced with an alternate design. Vibration levels, as reported by the remote monitoring system, remained low and reliability dramatically improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the cold mill at Hickman, the RT mill stand drives were equipped with four 5,000 HP synchronous motors. The motors were journal bearing machines and were not reliable. Thrusting and resultant bearing failures, along with pole piece electrical failures, led to the 2004 installation of a warning and trip system based on proximity probes on the motors and accelerometers on the mill gearboxes. This system not only supplied warning and trip capability, but also provided near real-time vibration data, including shaft orbits, to analysis personnel outside the mill. Remote analysis personnel could be hundreds of miles away, viewing near-real-time data, and consulting directly with pulpit operators on problems with the mill stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these and other successes, it was clear that remote machinery monitoring offered improvements and capabilities not provided by conventional means. However, this early system did have limitations. It relied on serial RS-485 communications with a scanner/site server. As the system expanded, sampling rates slowed down and the most recent data was not available in a timely fashion. It also used proprietary sensors, which limited configurability and flexibility of application. The system on the RT mill, while powerful, was expensive and was limited to one user at a time due to its use of VPN technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in late 2004 and early 2005, Nucor Hickman undertook deployment of wireless technology in the mill. The justification was shipping and inventory applications, cranes and systems in the hot mill, and to meet other operational requirements. At the same time, improved remote monitoring technology was coming on the market using the same wireless protocols. This new remote monitoring technology, developed by Azima DLI, used commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, standard networking protocols, and was much more flexible in terms of software and application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The convergence of wireless technology, its application in the mill, and the availability of improved technology all drove expansion of Nucor Hickman&amp;rsquo;s remote equipment monitoring. It is interesting to note that the wireless implementation and deployment was justified by other applications within the mill. The impact of the machinery monitoring data on the network has been minimal, and even with the extensive deployment at Nucor Hickman, represents a tiny fraction of network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nucor Hickman: Largest Remote Monitoring Deployment in the U.S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As of the publication of this article, the Nucor Hickman Sheet Mill was the site of the largest dynamic signal remote monitoring deployment in the United States. Azima remote monitoring technology is used on all mill cooling towers, all baghouse ID fans, all baghouse reverse air fans, caster mold water pumps, caster spray water pumps, all descale pumps, roof feed flux system aspiration fans, and mill air compressors. Remote monitoring system installation is underway on mill emergency generator sets, and is planned for the near future shape tension rolls in the cold mill. Approximately 280 sensors are remotely monitored. Mill personnel have full access to data, alert histories, alarms and warnings, reports and report/machine histories. Alerts are transmitted by e-mail and/or cell phone SMS text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system currently applied at Nucor Hickman communicates through the plant network either via 802.11b wireless technology or via standard Ethernet (unlike earlier systems, which required serial RS-485 communication). A single small site server (standard PC) is located at the plant to act as a data gateway and buffering device. If connectivity out of the mill is lost, the site server acts as a data storage device buffering data until connectivity is restored. One of the key features is that the monitoring application requires no software on the target client PC &amp;ndash; all that is required is Internet access and a login for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The system consists of sensors mounted on the target machine and a sensor hub that digitizes and aggregates data from the sensors. Collected data is transmitted securely to the plant network via either 802.11b wireless or Ethernet. (Note that, although not currently employed at Nucor Hickman, the system also supports data transmission via a cellular interface, independent of the plant network.)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. How the Azima DLI Remote Monitoring System Works at Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Data is sent via the plant network to the local site server and then out over the Internet to Azima DLI&amp;rsquo;s remote servers. Plant personnel, analysts or other authorized parties can then access the system via a secure Web portal. Access and privileges are controlled by double password, and depending on privileges, a user can have rights to view data, edit system settings, analyze data and/or issue reports. All data, alerts and alert histories, and reports generated by analysts are maintained on the Web portal. Histories of reports generated can be sorted and searched by plant area, date, machine, fault type and other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the number of remotely monitored machines continues to expand at Nucor Hickman, many less critical machines remain under manual surveillance by operators on rounds once a month. These machines include those in the balance of plant (hydraulic pumps, roll stand cooling pumps, furnace cooling pumps, and so forth). This monthly data is fed into the Azima DLI system and displayed via the same secure Web interface as the remotely collected data. This means that a mill-wide view of equipment health &amp;ndash; from all monitored machines, regardless of collection method &amp;ndash; is visible via a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Azima analysts are responsible for monitoring and analyzing all posted to the Web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Involved in Getting Remote Monitoring Started&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the most attractive features of the remote monitoring system at Hickman is that it is comprised primarily of low-cost, commercially available components (for example, COTS sensors) combined with advanced software and specialized sensor hubs. Careful planning and forethought is needed to ensure a successful remote monitoring deployment. Some of the lessons learned include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Careful thought should be given as to which machines are to be monitored and in what manner. In the case of Hickman, although the condition monitoring contractor had overall responsibility for the implementation and operation of the system, and for disseminating the analysis and results there from, each individual mill area had to decide what was to be monitored and how. Reporting relationships, access and other issues were all discussed and defined well ahead of the installation of monitoring equipment. There was a clear list of which equipment would benefit from automated remote monitoring and which could be sufficiently monitored by conventional methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Number of points per machine to be monitored is an important consideration. Simply mimicking what would have been done in a manual monitoring program (multiple points and measurements per bearing) is usually unnecessary and adds cost while delivering small incremental value.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If wireless transmission is to be employed, determine the best protocol for the site: 802.11b/g, ZigBee, or 900 megahertz. In the case of Hickman, 802.11b was the preferred choice and that has been universally true in other applications as well. It offers the widest selection of available devices, and can cover a wide area with just a few access points. The 802.11b protocol has proven to be very reliable and is immune to RF interference, even in the melt shop area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Involve IT early. Agreement needs to be reached on security, protocols, etc. well before the installation of a remote monitoring system. What are the mill&amp;rsquo;s security expectations and policies? Within the plant, is traditional Local Area Network (LAN) acceptable, or is a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) necessary? IT support during deployment is crucial to successful and efficient startup. Connectivity must be verified, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Remote Monitoring Benefits Nucor Hickman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The initial deployment of the current generation of remote machinery monitoring technology commenced in July 2005. The installation and commissioning of Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring system is continuing to expand. The hybrid approach of monitoring critical machines in parallel with traditional manual walk-around monitoring of balance-of-plant equipment, all reported via a common Web-based portal, has provided solid value to Nucor Hickman personnel. Several case studies demonstrating this value are briefly detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 1: Failure Caught Without Site Visit or Increased Costs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the spring of 2006, a 1,500 HP baghouse fan induction motor failed due to a sudden stator short failure. All of the baghouse fans were equipped with remote monitoring hubs and were under surveillance. The motor was replaced with a rebuilt spare. Immediately on restart of the fan, much higher vibration levels were noted by the remote monitoring analyst (who was not on site). Mill environmental department personnel, who were responsible for the baghouse and its equipment, were notified of the increased vibration. Further examination of the data identified the problem as an outer race defect on the inboard (drive end) bearing of the motor. Mill personnel requested an evaluation as to the likelihood of the motor continuing in service until the next maintenance outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analysis of the data and the rate of change indicated that it was likely that the unit would indeed continue to run. In an attempt to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, attempts at relubrication of the motor bearing were undertaken. Unfortunately, the relubrication actually increased the vibration, and the rate of deterioration increased dramatically. Mill personnel were advised of the change, and monitoring surveillance increased (frequency of data collection can be increased remotely via the Azima system&amp;rsquo;s interface). The unit continued to deteriorate and, by the weekend, had reached a stage wherein continued operation was questionable. A recommendation was made to remove the unit from service at the first opportunity. After mutual viewing of the data and trends by plant personnel in conference with the remote analyst, plant personnel decided to remove the unit from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A spare fan was placed in service while the motor replacement was undertaken. The spare fan also was equipped with sensors that reported to the Azima system. Prior to beginning disassembly of the failed fan, the spare was restarted and vibration and performance data was reviewed by the remote analyst, who confirmed that the spare fan was running well and could be expected to give reliable service while the failed fan was repaired. Only after the confirmation of the health of the spare was the failed fan removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It should be noted that at no time during this episode was the equipment analyst on site at the mill. Problem detection, confirmation of the problem and diagnostics (including the condition assessment of the spare fan) were all conducted remotely with no site visits and no costs incurred. In the case of the confirmation of the condition of the spare fan, the contractor analyst was in an airport hundreds of miles away and was still able to serve the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is unlikely that this level of detection, service and continued operation could have been achieved with conventional once/month survey method. Using conventional methods, it is likely that several site visits would have been required with extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/394552f5-f4a2-4740-b552-559d87eacac7_Nucor Hickman_2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Trend Graph Showing Vibration Increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 2: Air Compressor Runs the Last Mile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A centrifugal induction motor-driven air compressor had suffered from poor reliability for some time. Beginning in the spring of 2006, it was equipped with remote monitoring technology. Immediately upon installation of the system, dramatic variations in motor vibration level with compressor load were noted. Remotely acquired and analyzed vibration data indicated that bearing fits were in poor condition, and that the spacer gear coupling associated with this compressor was partially locked up. A recommendation was made to not yet remove the unit from service, but rather to continue to run and monitor it while preparations for a repair were made. Data also was provided to the motor repair vendor. The motor repair vendor concurred that the vibration data indicated a problem but that it was likely confined to the coupling. The recommendation was made by the motor repair vendor to disconnect the coupling, run the motor solo, and take manual measurements to confirm the coupling problem. The coupling was disconnected, the motor was run solo and manual vibration measurements were undertaken. The motor was actually worse in the uncoupled condition, and before the vibration measurements could be completed, the motor failed catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the motor repair was completed and the unit returned to service, the remote monitoring system was recommissioned and was able to confirm that the motor and compressor were in good condition and suitable for continued service. This condition persisted for several months, with the unit running well and remote monitoring continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, following a mill outage, the compressor motor vibration exhibited a small but unmistakable increase in overall vibration on the motor. The melt shop personnel were notified and the recommendation was made to continue to run the compressor. Monitoring frequency was increased and alert thresholds adjusted to compensate for the changes. No site visits were required and the increased monitoring and adjustments were accomplished remotely via the system&amp;rsquo;s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few weeks later, the adjusted alert levels were exceeded, and automated alerts were issued. No other changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within a few more weeks, the steady trend upward in motor vibration continued. Plant personnel were continuously advised as to the deteriorating condition of the unit, as was the motor repair vendor. Finally, the deterioration reached a level where the remote analyst recommended removing the unit from service at the convenient opportunity. The motor repair vendor sent personnel to the site to take manual vibration measurements on the motor. The manual measurements confirmed the problem and the unit was removed from service and sent out for repair. A coupling issue and deterioration of the inboard motor bearing was confirmed. Again, no site visits by analysis personnel were required and the plant was able to &amp;ldquo;run the unit the last mile&amp;rdquo; without incurring catastrophic failure or mill outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/46d29376-fd1c-4a99-999f-5fa8c7feb97e_Nucor Hickman_3.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Vibration Trend on Compressor Drive Motor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case Study 3: Remote Monitoring Enables System-Wide Process Optimization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A remote monitoring system can, as in the cases above, greatly expand on the capabilities of conventional rotating machinery vibration analysis. What many do not realize is that remote monitoring technology can also contribute in ways that are not possible with conventional manual monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The baghouse fans at NUCOR Hickman are vital to the plant. Maintenance of plant productivity, while still staying within permitted emission limits, is essential to plant profitability. Operating costs (in terms of power consumption) for several thousand horsepower of fan drives is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The monitoring system, as applied to the baghouse fans at Hickman, incorporates vibration measurements along with load current measurements. Sampling rates are very rapid, and the baghouse fans at Hickman have an essentially unity power factor. The fan motors are not individually metered at the MCCs. With the rapid sampling of the remote monitoring system, however, it became possible to get a reasonably accurate measure of fan load and operating cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Soon after commissioning the baghouse fan remote monitoring system, is was seen that variations in fan load and fan vibration were, not surprisingly, directly related to tap-to-tap cycles of the EAFs. All of the fans take suction from a common plenum, which is in turn fed by the furnace and canopy ducts. Data collected by the remote monitoring system allowed observation of the dynamics of fan load as the melt shop underwent normal operation cycles. The ability to average and integrate the load data unexpectedly revealed that significant variation in fan HP load existed not only during furnace cycles but from one fan to another. The data indicated a several-thousand-dollars-per-month variation in the operating cost of the fans. After data review, it became apparent that there was significant temperature (and thus density and mass flow) variation from one fan to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The variation in load was confirmed by temperature measurements and infrared thermographic observation of the change in duct temperatures over time. Poor distribution in the plenum has been partially corrected by installing turning vanes in the plenum and adjusting damper control strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Material improvements in fan efficiency have been realized as a result of these actions. The remote monitoring system allowed quantification of these issues and the ability to directly measure the effects of corrective action. This would not have been possible with conventional machinery monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nucor Hickman is embracing new remote monitoring technologies and integrating them with its existing manual data collection process. By determining the most effective monitoring method for each machine &amp;ndash; based on level of criticality, history of problems, and so forth &amp;ndash; Nucor has established a comprehensive monitoring program that delivers increased uptime, reduced safety risks, and lower maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By choosing the Azima DLI monitoring and diagnostics system, Nucor has installed a flexible system that supports the integration of data collected both by automated system and manual rounds. All data is presented via a single, secure Web interface. This enables mill-wide alerts to potential problems and delivers critical data to remotely located Azima analysts for review, analysis and advice. In addition to providing more comprehensive monitoring, Azima&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring solution has reduced the demand on existing resources at Nucor Hickman and frees them up to focus on maintenance rather than data collection. The program has been successful to date at Hickman, with clear successes and benefits, and further expansion is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As with most technological pursuits the real reason for success is people. We wish to offer sincerest thanks to the team at Nucor Hickman. The manager of the environmental department, Wayne Turney, and the department supervisor, Dan Bullock, have been particularly instrumental in the ongoing implementation. Dave DaVolt, Rod Wycoff, Claude Riggin, Justin Smith, Ashley Tippet, Tom Wright and Lou Incrocci in the hot mill, cold mill and melt shop have all contributed to the successful demonstration of these technologies. Likewise, success would have been impossible without the support, expert advice and consultation from the Nucor Hickman IT group. Rudy Moser, department manager, and Jim Walmsley, network support, were essential in making the implementation a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the part of Azima DLI, Dr. Ed Futcher and his development team created the tools to make the systems possible, and Heather De Jes&amp;uacute;s and Dave Geswein, Azima engineering, deployed the system at the mill. Nelson A. Baxter, vice president of diagnostics for Azima, was invaluable in technical support and expertise. Elsa Anzalone, account manager for Azima, made the case for what has been achieved in this project, and her contributions have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

	At the 2010 International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago, Baldor Electric product manager George Weihrauch talks about the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and what the new motor efficiency requirements mean to the end-user. EISA, which was signed into law in 2007, becomes effective on December 19, 2010. This law expands the mandated energy efficiency standards from the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) for a wider range industrial motors which are manufactured for sale in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Testing tip: Armature defects on DC motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Current analysis of DC motors can provide health assessment of the DC armature while the motor is running. Armature-related anomalies can include commutator bar defects, riser defects (very common) and shorted turns or coils in the armature circuit. The fundamental analysis of these anomalies starts with understanding that the bar, riser or winding with a fault passes under and out of the carbon brush face at a rate of the shaft speed times the number of brushes passed in a rotation. This causes a modulation of the DC armature current. A DC motor turning at 2,000 rpm with four brush holders&amp;nbsp;has a brush passing frequency of 8,000 rpm, or 133.33 Hz. Trending of the brush passing frequency amplitude is highly recommended for early identification of developing armature circuit anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Infrastructure expansion, energy savings propel growth in high-power AC drives</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	During the turbulent economy of 2009, the global high-power AC drives market experienced only a slight downturn, and ARC expects the high-power AC drives market to experience healthy growth during the forecast period through 2014.&amp;nbsp;According to a new ARC Advisory Group study, in advanced and emerging economies, infrastructure development continued as a significant portion of government stimulus funding directed to those industries.&amp;nbsp;As the economy continues to recover, globalization will spur more capital investments in various industries, such as oil &amp;amp; gas, water &amp;amp; wastewater, electric power, building automation, and mining, driven by the demand for added energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="right" alt="High" border="0" hspace="5" src="http://www.arcweb.com/momag/graph-achi-cr.gif" vspace="5" /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Among all automation products, high-power AC drives have a unique position in that they satisfy needs for both automation and direct energy savings, two critical factors for industrial operations to survive and succeed in this global economy,&amp;rdquo; according to senior analyst &lt;a href="mailto:hshah@arcweb.com"&gt;Himanshu Shah&lt;/a&gt;, the principal author of ARC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.arcweb.com/Research/Studies/Pages/ACDrives-HP.aspx"&gt;High-Power AC Drive Worldwide Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Investments in Infrastructure Will Drive Market Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Globalization has created a large demand for modern infrastructure, especially in emerging economies.&amp;nbsp;Airport facilities, railway and public transportation expansions, and new road construction are driving demand for products from the metals &amp;amp; mining, cement &amp;amp; glass, and oil &amp;amp; gas industries. Emerging economies know that their current infrastructure is a major bottleneck for their continuing high economic growth.&amp;nbsp;Automation is key for any infrastructure developments and operations, and high-power AC drives are one of the critical components in these investments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Government initiatives in most countries support incentives for companies to take energy-saving measures. While emerging markets are adopting various policies to increase energy resources, they are also offering attractive incentives for energy savings, such as tax benefits and carbon credits. As a result, industry is deploying additional energy-conserving devices, such as high-power AC drives, which save significant amounts of energy.&amp;nbsp;The electric power industry in general also becomes more efficient with the use of high-power AC drives. Additionally, energy volatility and scarcity, as well as sustainability initiatives by industry, will continue to positively affect the market for high-power AC drives in a wide range of new applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Growth in emerging and developing economies is expected to accelerate further throughout the forecast period.&amp;nbsp;Stronger economic frameworks and swift policy responses have helped many emerging economies to cushion the impact of the unprecedented external shock and quickly re-attract capital flows.&amp;nbsp;Within these markets, growth performance is expected to vary considerably across countries and regions, reflecting different initial conditions, external shocks, and policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While every world region will experience growth in the high-power AC drives market over the forecast period, there are significantly different factors affecting this market growth.&amp;nbsp;A brief description regarding the economic scenarios for each major world area is covered in this report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the quantitative assessment of the high-power AC drives market, the report provides an insightful analysis of the market and strategies of leading suppliers that will impact this business in the future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Energy savings, sustainability to propel low-power AC drives market growth</title>
            <description>&lt;div class="ExternalClass4C6045AAACFF4D03827A8944F025264D"&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		Recovering from the deepest global downturn in recent history, ARC expects the low-power AC drives market to resume steady growth during the forecast period through 2014. According to a new ARC Advisory Group study, this trend will be due to growing investments in the infrastructure and manufacturing industries worldwide, additional requirements to increase the energy supply to keep up with rising demand, and pressure from industry to deploy sustainability solutions that reduce costs by saving energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;img align="right" alt="Low" border="0" hspace="5" src="http://www.arcweb.com/momag/graph-aclow-cr.gif" vspace="5" /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Emerging economies, such as those in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries and Eastern Europe, will again have increasing consumer demand from the growing middle class, more investments pouring into new infrastructures, and the need for producing and saving energy to cope with rising energy demands and costs in the future. This situation will bode well for low power AC drives market growth,&amp;rdquo; according to senior analyst &lt;a href="mailto:hshah@arcweb.com"&gt;Himanshu Shah&lt;/a&gt;, the principal author of ARC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.arcweb.com/Research/Studies/Pages/ACDrives-LP.aspx"&gt;Low-Power AC Drives Worldwide Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity and Globalization Also Accelerate Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Manufacturers continually face challenges to raise productivity, lower product costs, reduce plant operating expenses and increase return on investment in order to compete in the global market.&amp;nbsp;Saving energy will be the key component for most organizations to be successful and profitable as energy costs are expected to rise.&amp;nbsp;Consequently, capital investments for low power AC drives are expected to grow across many industries as these solutions simultaneously save energy and raise productivity of machinery by providing better and more precise speed control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		Globalization is driving the use of advanced automation and energy-saving equipment worldwide. This will directly result in an increased use of low-power AC drives, which are widely employed across the process, discrete, and infrastructure industries such as building automation, chemicals, oil &amp;amp; gas, food &amp;amp; beverage, textiles, utilities, water &amp;amp; wastewater, and metals&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		Energy volatility and scarcity, as well as sustainability, are affecting automation in a wide range of industries. Requirements for increased safety, regulatory compliances, sustainability, and energy savings are substantially impacting the design and capabilities of low-power AC drives.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Asia&amp;rsquo;s strong demand for energy created turmoil in oil pricing.&amp;nbsp;Crude oil prices that reached nearly $150 per barrel in mid 2008 were back down to moderate levels in the early part of 2009.&amp;nbsp;The world, however, got the taste of very high oil prices, which created a major awareness of the importance of new sources of energy, alternative energies, and energy savings; and the importance of the use of low power AC drives.&amp;nbsp;Energy scarcity is driving initiatives for energy saving and energy production which will boost the deployment of low power AC drives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		While every world region will experience growth in the low-power AC drives market over the forecast period, there are significantly different factors affecting this market growth. A brief description regarding the economic scenarios for each major world area is covered in this report.&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip covers inverter testing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	There is no need to be intimidated when testing motors that are powered by VFDs. Although there seems to be the thought of some unknown &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; technology at work, it can be easily understood visually. Using the MCEMAX tester online and two simple Power Analysis tests allows us to see the current carrying components and their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Viewing the Voltage and Current Time Domain of a Power Analysis test on the input of the drive, we can see the voltage supplied to the drive and the individual semi-conductors used to rectify the voltage in the current waveform. By visually inspecting the current waveform, we should see three individual currents all producing an alternating positive/negative &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; hump pattern waveform. All three phases should be symmetrical. Any asymmetrical waveforms or current flow in between humps in a phase can be indicative of a pending semiconductor failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a Power Analysis capture on the output of the drive, we can see the voltage production of the drive and the reaction in current from the motor. Viewing the Voltage and Current Time Domain, we can see the output IGBT (Isolated Gate Bi-polar Transistor) components and their triggering. Selecting only the Phase-to-Phase voltage patterns (scale x 4 or 8) we can see the individual cycles of the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Once again look for symmetry. All three phases should be producing identical waveforms. If they are not, we know the drive gate drive circuit is not functioning properly or we have a failing IGBT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>EISA regulation requirements for hazardous location motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in December 2010, the new Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) government regulations will change motor manufacturers requirements to meet NEMA Premium standards for NEMA and IEC frame sizes on motors less than 600 volts. PdMA has been&amp;nbsp;discussing this new&amp;nbsp;regulation in a five-part series of tips highlighting some of the issues that may impact you. Here is Part 4 of the series.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hazardous Location Motors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Although manufacturers were given a two-year extension for compliance in the original EPAct regulation, the EISA regulation requires all hazardous location motors to&amp;nbsp;move to NEMA Premium standards in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To view the EISA, go to: &lt;a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1103584351682&amp;amp;s=4679&amp;amp;e=001MJFCmSsdNtFupToT2kP2SCihgEWK2KSoHgFZiv7UehfBnoTAf0cTXxSFM9ekOWrfyef6F5_JmpeX7mBX57xLpNmAC_iElOi4U5VAxleU87lcCl8YOwwYLvOoPe4__AbmrUx8kCpKV90_j-Ject67tTKxTmBLuW5FSq_KaKPBrW-Niy_3MPA1wBtbeoZbe95k9r2zfvM6sWrJS2eb5vTv1p_tJJt_FQU3" linktype="link" shape="rect" target="_blank" track="on"&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;amp;docid=f:h6enr.txt.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why you need world-class motor management and maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ask a manufacturer how long a motor it makes is expected to live, and the response will be something like, &amp;ldquo;20-plus years in the right environment.&amp;rdquo; Ask the same question in a facility that uses such a motor, and the answer is more likely to be, &amp;ldquo;If we get five years out of it, we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!&amp;rdquo; Why does this discrepancy exist? Why do motors die of an infant mortality instead of living to the ripe old age for which they are designed and built? The answers have to do with the failure to optimize motor management and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a shift in philosophy with regard to motor management and maintenance. Companies no longer regard it as a cost center or a necessary evil. Rather, optimizing the lifespan of motor assets is now considered an opportunity. Business owners have come to recognize motor reliability as a decisive variable in overall profitability and competitiveness. Previously, they purchased information systems and software programs to attack the challenge from different vantage points, but until now, technology has not provided a turnkey solution for optimizing the motor management and maintenance processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Four Levels of Software: A Puzzle with Pieces Missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Now companies recognize that optimal motor management and maintenance brings greater reliability. Greater reliability, in turn, ensures the best return on asset values, as well as less downtime and, therefore, more cost-effective manufacturing. This recognition led to the birth of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), a coordinated approach to maintenance, communicated through a centralized base and directed toward the overall reliability of assets and machinery. There are four levels of technology that facilitate this coordinated approach. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 1: Technology-level software.&lt;/strong&gt; The software in this category has been limited to identifying health concerns with motors. It is designed around widely accepted standards for motor reliability and delivers alerts and alarms recommended by IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) or NEMA (the National Electric Manufacturers Association). These serve as a first level of notice that something is wrong with the motor or with the system in which it is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 2: Information management software.&lt;/strong&gt; A handful of software tools are available that are designed to organize information about a specific asset so that a supervisor, planner or technician can rapidly identify trends or indications of problems related to that asset. Much of this information amounts to historical data on a motor that allows personnel to track which systems the motor has been installed in and what kinds of problems it has encountered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 3: CMMS, centralized maintenance management software.&lt;/strong&gt; Best-of-breed CMMS packages provide centralized information management on a company&amp;rsquo;s motor assets in a variety of technologies &amp;ndash; electrical, mechanical, vibration and others. It is the central location where work requests are initiated and work orders are submitted and authorized. The software tracks each asset&amp;rsquo;s work request and work order history so that personnel can look up the status and type of maintenance or repair work currently being performed on an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 4: EAM, enterprise asset management. &lt;/strong&gt;Top-level recognition of maintenance as a critical portion of business decisions is the driver behind popular business-level software programs such as those produced by SAP. CMMS software is often linked directly to a company&amp;rsquo;s EAM platform so that reliability and return on investment (ROI) of assets can be monitored directly at the highest levels to ensure cost-effective and competitive manufacturing. Some EAM programs include their own CMMS modules, which are, however, not usually best-of-breed software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While each of these technology levels is critical to the overall picture, they only present partial pieces of the puzzle. What has been missing is a turnkey approach to tracking motor management and maintenance cradle to grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cradle-to-grave Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ideal technology supports the entire motor management and maintenance effort from cradle to grave, without the need to purchase and integrate several software packages. The process of assuring motor reliability begins with specification. It continues on to quality control upon receipt of the asset, then to proper storage, to pre- and post-installation verification, to monitoring the asset while operational. The final stage of the process is having the right information to recognize when a motor has become afflicted with a terminal disease or is near the end of its life for other reasons. Then the process begins again with a replacement motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Precision specification.&lt;/strong&gt; Cradle-to-grave management software includes a tool for precision specification, a growing trend in motor management. When forward-thinking companies buy a motor today, they begin with stringent specifications to make sure it is the highest-quality motor available in the marketplace. They know that it is more cost-effective in the long run to purchase a superior, highly reliable motor than to pay a low price up front and then waste resources on frequent repairs. A cradle-to-grave approach to motor management includes technology that allows motors to be pre-qualified at purchase to &amp;ldquo;design out&amp;rdquo; potential problems from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Quality control.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality control is a paramount but often overlooked component of reliability. Motors are sometimes defective upon arrival. As such, much testing, troubleshooting and repair down the road could be avoided with solid-quality control at the time of receipt. The old adage is, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a car that was built on a Friday. In other words, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a motor and count on its warranty, hoping for the best. Starting with a new motor that is 100 percent perfect will increase its long-term life expectancy and decrease reliability concerns with its installed application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Scheduling and tracking.&lt;/strong&gt; Scheduling and tracking are important to the efficient use of a motor in any industrial environment. For example, just like a human body, a motor needs regular checkups and maintenance so that any trends pointing toward a health problem can be identified and corrected or reversed before they become terminal illnesses. Because problems directly or indirectly related to a motor can be very subtle, thorough tracking of a motor&amp;rsquo;s history can identify negative trends. Such tracking must be automated because people are generally too busy with other tasks to keep notes on the history of motors. While everyone has good intentions about maintenance, it is generally eclipsed by other priorities. Further, the population of workers available to perform testing and analysis on motor assets is dwindling, making the need for automated scheduling and tracking that much more vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another important reason for tracking a motor&amp;rsquo;s reliability and maintenance history is to be able to recognize the point of diminishing return. If a motor&amp;rsquo;s problems and repairs are not tracked, investments may be made in maintaining and repairing it when it is no longer cost effective to do so. For instance, if a motor has been rewound 13 times, another rewinding is inadvisable because the motor will be very inefficient despite this maintenance effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact is that if maintenance activities are not scheduled and tracked, they probably will not occur. Furthermore, in the absence of automated scheduling, analysis and trending of data to identify conditions leading to lower reliability, potential problems will be overlooked, and the plant&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Predictive testing and trending.&lt;/strong&gt; Testing and trending needs to be predictive rather than just preventive or reactive. Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify that important distinction with a medical analogy. Regular medical checkups are predictive in that the findings may predict illnesses. A preventive measure would be taking vitamins on a regular basis to minimize the risk of unhealthy conditions. However, since the body eliminates excess vitamins, it is not necessary to be predictive about taking vitamins, which would amount to taking a blood test every day. Being reactive about one&amp;rsquo;s health would mean to stop eating junk food once diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Like medical checkups, software-enabled predictive maintenance is designed to identify conditions that are conducive to failure or lower reliability, so that they can be corrected to increase the life expectancy of an asset or motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cradle-to-grave reliability software tracks the history of repairs, or mean time between failures, to show faults so that their source can be identified and remedied. Without such historical information, repeated repairs or continual cleaning of a motor may waste a company&amp;rsquo;s resources on correcting symptoms while missing the real disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Tracking installation history. &lt;/strong&gt;Tracking the history of a motor itself is not enough. Turnkey reliability software also tracks the history of the systems in which the motor is installed. This is particularly important when a motor is used in a number of different systems, from fans to pumps to compressors. If a motor fails as part of a pump, is sent to repair, installed in a fan, fails again, is repaired again, installed in a compressor, and fails yet again, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware that the motor has failed every time and to know why it failed. Knowing whether it failed for the same or a completely different reason each time is critical to making a decision about its future. If analysis shows that none of the failings are related, the motor may still have 10 years of life and is, therefore, worth maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say a motor&amp;rsquo;s application history shows that its last failure was due to a ground fault when it was installed in a ventilation fan. A review of the fan&amp;rsquo;s history reveals that all of the last three motors installed in it failed due to insulation to ground. A common fault mechanism has now been identified and can be further investigated. A technician is dispatched to the site and discovers that the motor above the fan is leaking grease into the fan&amp;rsquo;s motor. If the history of the fan and its motors had not been tracked, several more motors might have failed, wasting resources on repeated repairs. Again, it is critical to automate the tracking of where a motor has been and what problems it has encountered so that personnel can focus on making the right decision rather than spending valuable time on analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New turnkey software at the technology level now enables the comprehensive management and maintenance of motors through all of these important stages of an asset&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; from precision specification to recognizing when the motor must be replaced. In short, this is cradle to grave. The software also delivers that information to asset management platforms so that senior management can make decisions that will continue to increase the company&amp;rsquo;s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Solution to Last a Lifetime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime. A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Motor categories that must meet NEMA Premium standards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in December 2010 the new Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) government regulations will change motor manufacturers requirements to meet NEMA Premium standards for NEMA and IEC frame sizes on motors less than 600 volts. We will be discussing this new&amp;nbsp;regulation in a five-part series of tips highlighting some of the issues that may impact you. Here is Part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

		1 to 200 horsepower general purpose&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Polyphase design A &amp;amp; B to 600VAC&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TEFC, ODP, explosion proof&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Brake motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEMA 140T frames to 449&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Foot mounted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		C-face foot mounted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Severe duty, washdown, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

            <title>Static and dynamic testing as part of PdM programs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Predictive maintenance programs (PMPs) are becoming universally accepted as the best method for maintaining motor reliability within most modern plants and facilities. A complete PMP will include as many technologies as possible, with each technology providing vital pieces to the diagnostic puzzle. Periodic static testing and more aggressive dynamic testing of motors are essential parts of predicting the potential for a motor to continue a safe and successful operation. Tracking and trending the results of electric motor testing on a regular schedule is the most effective method of making intelligent predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The need for motor testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The steady, safe and efficient operation of electric motors is essential to the productivity of all plants and facilities. Some facilities have many critical and/or expensive motors. A motor failure could be catastrophic, causing lost production and costly emergency repairs. For example, a motor failure at a nuclear plant can cost up to $1 million a day for critical motors and may have a disastrous, long-lasting impact. Even failures at a wastewater treatment facility can have a huge, negative environmental effect and can be very costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motors fail due to numerous operational circumstances, including power condition, mechanical influences and environmental hazards. According to IEEE&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and EPRI&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; studies, at least 35 to 45 percent of motor failures are electrically related. Monitoring the motors &amp;ldquo;electrical health&amp;rdquo; is, unquestionably, an important and vital consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trending the historical operating condition of a motor makes early detection of any decline in the motors &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; possible. Planning downtime and having only minor reconditioning repairs instead of a major rewind or replacement is far less expensive in both repair costs and lost production. Since electric motors begin deteriorating the instant they are started, it is necessary to monitor their operating condition on a routine, periodic schedule. Periodic monitoring and trending of data collected and properly diagnosed provides the technician with evidence needed to prepare for downtime before a catastrophe occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is no longer practical to just &amp;ldquo;megger&amp;rdquo; a motor in order to determine its condition. Plants and facilities depend on a complete predictive maintenance program (PMP) to monitor their operations and plan their repair schedules. A good PMP requires both static (and off-line) and dynamic (or on-line) testing, with educated and trained technicians monitoring data routinely, with quality equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides voltages and currents, on-line test equipment must be able to capture and trend torque ripple and torque signatures as well as rotor bar sidebands. Off-line testing with modern, high-voltage test equipment is essential to getting reliable data. The voltages required to properly test motor windings cannot be reached with impedance-based or low-voltage test equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;On-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Effective dynamic test equipment must be able to collect and trend all essential data that affects the operation of electric motors. Power condition &amp;ndash; including voltage level, voltage imbalance and harmonic distortions, current levels and current imbalances, load levels, torque signatures, rotor bar signatures, service factors and efficiencies &amp;ndash; should be tracked and trended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On-line testing is performed at the motor&amp;rsquo;s MCC, at the load side of a variable frequency drive or at an installed port, which allows for on-line testing without opening the MCC. Data is collected through a set of current transformers and corresponding voltage probes. The data collected, processed and analyzed provides the technician with an overall view of the normal operational environment to which the motor is subjected on a daily basis and of how the motor is responding within this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Often, a motor is subjected to incoming power problems including low or high voltages, voltage imbalances and harmonic distortions. Lower voltages cause higher currents and, therefore, more heat. Higher voltages cause lower power factors and ultimately higher losses. A small amount of voltage imbalance creates an exponential amount of current imbalance which causes temperature increases. Harmonic distortion also causes thermal stress in motors. Any of these voltage problems can cause severe overheating in the motor even without factually reaching an over-load situation, and excessive heat is the insulation&amp;rsquo;s major enemy. Some motors are subjected to physical obstacles that cause undue stress. Over-greasing, misalignment and over-tightened belts all cause thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many motor failures can be traced to load related situations. Erratic torque signatures can be an indicator of load-related problems. Broken or cracked rotor bars also can cause premature motor failures. On-line testing identifies these problems, and routine trending will reveal the rate of decline. Of major importance to the overall health of a motor also is the &amp;ldquo;effective service factor.&amp;rdquo; Two elements affect the service factor number are: real operating power condition (voltage quality) and steady state load conditions. The effective service factor number represents the thermal stress caused by these two conditions on the motor. On-line testing can find and trend all of these motor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic testing schedules should be tailored individually according to operating time, criticality and any other important element of operation. Generally, an on-line test should be performed at least quarterly. Motors that begin to show obvious decline or thermal over-stressing should be monitored more closely until the motor can be statically tested or removed from operation and repaired. New and recently repaired motors should be tested as soon as they are returned to service in order to provide a historical record (or baseline) of their performance when the motor is at its &amp;ldquo;best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Off-line testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In general, motors are quite reliable, and when properly maintained, you should expect at least 100,000 hours of continual operation. That is to say, a new motor operated within nameplate parameters should give us at least 11 years of steady use. Unfortunately, motors are almost always subjected to a variety of damaging elements, with the end result being a rise in operating temperature. Thermal aging of the insulation is the major cause of insulation failure. Years of testing and numerous studies have shown that, as a &amp;ldquo;rule of thumb,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;for every 10 degrees centigrade increase in temperature, the winding life is decreased in half.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Besides thermal problems, other causes of insulation failures include incoming line related problems. Spikes caused by lightning and surges created by switching and contactor closing contribute to insulation breakdown. Motors also are subjected to mechanical influences including bearing failure, environmental hazards and magnet wire damage caused during the manufacturing process. Even the physical movements of the windings during startups causes wear to the insulation system, especially the magnet-wire insulation, as D.E. Crawford has shown.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper testing of all components of a motor requires a series of tests designed to emulate the conditions the motor will see in the field. It has been proved in numerous studies that low-voltage testing, including capacitance, inductance, impedance, etc., are not effective tools in verifying insulation problems. Quality off-line test equipment will be able to perform winding resistance tests, insulation-resistance tests, high-potential (HiPot) tests, polarization index, and surge tests at IEEE, NEMA and EASA accepted standards. Top-quality test equipment will automatically run a series of preprogrammed tests and provide a complete final report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This automatic equipment will stop testing before any damage is done to the windings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The resistance test verifies the existence of dead shorts within the turn-to-turn coils and shows any imbalances between phases due to turn count differences, along with locating poor wire connections or contacts and finds open parallel coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DC insulation resistance testing detects faults in ground wall insulation or motors that have already failed to ground. Weak ground wall insulation (prior to copper-to-ground failure) can only be found successfully with the HiPot tests. The ground wall insulation system consists of the magnet wires insulation, slot liner insulation, wedges, varnish and often phase paper. DC HiPot test should be performed at twice line voltage plus 1,000 volts since motors will see voltage spikes of at least that level during each startup. HiPot testing is necessary to verify winding suitability for continued service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Surge testing detects faults in both inter-turn winding and phase-to-phase insulation systems. Turn-to-turn faults will not be seen by a megger or HiPot test. Potential faults can only be seen when the coils see more than 350 volts from turn-to-turn or coil-to-coil, as described by Paschen&amp;rsquo;s Law &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Figure 1). The typical mechanism of fault progression is a turn-to-turn short, causing excessive heat and progressing within seconds or minutes to copper to ground faults. Faults are much more likely to occur between turn-to-turn winding coils due to the added stress caused by bending and exaggerated during the winding process. The ground wall insulation is generally many times stronger and more capable of withstanding voltage spikes and other stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Integrating on-line and off-line testing into a predictive maintenance program provides the technician with verification of his motor&amp;rsquo;s condition (see case studies below). Both technologies are necessary in order to have a complete picture of a motor&amp;rsquo;s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Collecting both on-line and off-line data on a routine schedule allows for early warning of impending failures and opens the opportunity window for planned downtime. Performing resistance, HiPot and surge testing along with dynamic testing provides the technician with a total picture of the motor&amp;rsquo;s condition and allows him or her to track its rate of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern test equipment includes enhanced and detailed reporting. Reports are easily generated, providing a written hard copy of test results and making diagnosing and comparing of data clearer and more accurate. Setting up and managing a program to monitor the motors within any facility is essential to insure the safe and continued operation and production of the facility. In most cases, a properly managed and operated PMP will save a plant or facility much more than it will cost to implement, administer and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Case studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	1) At a large wastewater treatment facility in Florida, 14 identical motors were scheduled for predictive maintenance. These motors were 40-horsepower aerators for a large treatment tank and operated continuously. Static tests were performed on all 14, and each received passing marks on all tests. When dynamic testing was complete, it was noted that 13 motors were acting very similar running within expected parameters at approximately 85 percent load, while the 14th motor was running at just over 30 percent load. Further inspection revealed a sheared coupling on the motor running at reduced load. The operators had no way of detecting the problem, and the location of these motors made visual inspection difficult. The dynamic testing found a problem that was costing the customer both in wasted kilowatt usage and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2) Twelve 60-horsepower pump/motors were tested at a large office building. Six were chilled water pump/motors and six were condenser water circulating pump/motors. All 12 were installed at the same time and ran continuously. Dynamic testing was performed one day on all 12, and all appeared to be operating within expected parameters. The motors were shut down for a scheduled annual routine building maintenance, and static testing was planned for the following morning. Resistance tests appeared normal on all, but two would not pass HiPot testing at the preset voltage. Three others failed the surge tests. The five motors were removed from service, disassembled and inspected. Two were found to be extremely dirty, while three had no visual damage. All five were reconditioned, retested and replaced in service. The off-line testing prevented five potential catastrophic failures and allowed the customer to dictate the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>EISA: What does this mean for your electric motors strategy?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in December 2010, the new Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) government regulations will change motor manufacturers requirements to meet NEMA Premium standards for NEMA and IEC frame sizes on motors less than 600 volts. We will be discussing this new&amp;nbsp;regulation in a five-part series of tips highlighting some of the issues that may impact you. This article is Part 1 in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following&amp;nbsp;motor categories, not previously required to meet the EPAct efficiency levels, are now required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		8-pole motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close-coupled pump motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Design C&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		U-frame motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		3-ph motors of not more than 600 volts (other than 230v or 460v) including IEC frame motors from 90 frame and up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		C-face or D-flange without base&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		201 to 500 HP motors not previously covered by EPAct will be required to comply with Energy Efficient efficiencies as defined by NEMA MG 1, Table 12-11&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Vertical solid shaft normal thrust motors (P-base) (as tested in a horizontal configuration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip: Minimize your starts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motors experience severe&amp;nbsp;stresses during the start-up process. Rotor bar temperatures increase significantly,&amp;nbsp;stator winding end turns expand and move against their restraints, and magnetic forces pull the rotor and stator together.&amp;nbsp;Once the motor is up and running with a stable load these stresses are reduced. If&amp;nbsp;your electric motor testing indicates a reduced reliability, minimize your motor starts to prevent a catastrophic failure of the rotor cage or stator windings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Solving problems after plant energy upgrades</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Trying to save energy dollars is not always as simple as it seems. Installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) and retrofitting lighting systems are two of the quickest and most widely accepted ways to achieve significant energy savings. Yet, new problems may surface as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the first steps in solving these problems is to understand that the energy-efficient devices themselves may be the cause. While most energy-saving electronic lighting ballasts, lighting controls and&lt;br /&gt;
	VFDs work just fine on modern electrical distribution systems, this equipment can create troubleshooting nightmares in older facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electrical problems resulting from high-efficiency, energy-savings upgrades fall into one or more of three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Application&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Installation (including startup)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;VFD mismatches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the most common energy-saving applications in facilities is to use VFDs on centrifugal pumps, fans and blowers. Varying motor speeds is a much more efficient way to control flow rates and, thereby, maintain water temperatures than to run the motor and pump at full speed and throttle a valve to adjust flow rates. But problems will result if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The VFD has not been properly sized and selected&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The drive and motor installation was not done with a VFD in mind&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Parameters were not properly set at startup&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The effects of harmonic currents were not considered in design and addressed in maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The non-linear effect of electronic loads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Variable frequency drives are complex electronic devices called non-linear loads that vary their output voltage and frequency to control motor speed. The distribution system supplies voltage, however current does not flow into the VFD until the rectifier circuit in the converter section begins to conduct. Since current does not flow linearly as voltage is applied, the equipment is called &amp;ldquo;non-linear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the diodes suddenly allow current flow, it creates a &amp;ldquo;notch&amp;rdquo; on the sine wave that causes sine wave distortion. The VFD rectifier circuit also causes currents to flow back into the distribution system in multiples of 60 hertz (Hz). Current that flows back in multiples of the fundamental is called harmonic current. The third harmonic is three times the fundamental of 60 Hz, or 180 Hz. The fifth harmonic current is at 300 Hz, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Harmonics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	These harmonic currents not only tend to distort voltage throughout the plant, but certain harmonic frequencies create problems unique to that harmonic. For example, the third harmonic causes overheating in neutral conductors and transformers. The fifth harmonic can cause motor issues, such as overheating, abnormal noise and vibrations, and motor inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The bottom line: All electronic equipment creates harmonics and distorts the voltage distributed in-plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other typical non-linear loads added during energy upgrades include electronic ballasts, computers, controls (PLCs, etc.), and various components of building automation systems. Always use a true-rms responding test tool when measuring non-linear loads, especially current. For a backgrounder on why true-rms, visit &lt;a href="http://www.fluke.com/true-rms"&gt;www.fluke.com/true-rms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here is the root cause of the problem: Modern control systems are quite often sensitive to any quality problems with the electrical power they are supplied. That means non-linear, high-efficiency loads create operational problems not only with other sensitive plant equipment, but with themselves as well. Ironically, the very equipment installed to save energy often causes inefficiencies and unexpected maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, some quick checks and basic electrical troubleshooting can resolve many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;VFD troubleshooting examples&lt;br /&gt;
	Poor motor speed control and/or nuisance trips: &lt;/strong&gt;For example, a typical VFD problem encountered in the field is that the drive fails to control motor speed properly and may even experience nuisance trips. The two mostly likely causes of this particular problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Voltage unbalance on the three phases supplying the drive&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Harmonics flowing out of the drive, back into the distribution system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a chiller with a VFD installed may experience temperature control problems at specified locations in the system due to distorted sine waves created by the harmonics. This distortion affects the operation of PLCs, temperature controllers and other controls in the chiller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another possibility: If tachometer feedback cables are not properly selected and installed, erroneous motor speed information will be fed back into the VFD, making it impossible for the VFD to control real motor speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The solution: Run shielded cable for these low-voltage signals and ground only at one end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When routing these low-voltage conductors, ensure they are not installed close to power conductors. Electromagnetic induction from power cables can affect low-voltage control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Installation checks: &lt;/strong&gt;To troubleshoot VFD control problems, first review the installation design. Chances are that the proper drive, motor and associated equipment were selected &amp;ndash; but verify anyhow. Walk down and observe the installation. Were correct cable types selected and installed properly? Is the installation suitable for the environment in which it is installed? Are enclosures free of dust and adequate ventilation provided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Drive parameter checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Review the parameters programmed into the drive. Does the data entered match the motor nameplate? Has the drive been set for proper operation, such as variable torque for energy-saving pump and fan applications? If the VFD is not controlling the motor as expected, it could be because operational parameters were either not set correctly or, more than likely, were reset by some well-meaning individual attempting to correct other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Quick measurement checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure VFD input voltage with a true-rms digital multimeter, verifying voltage unbalance falls within manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specifications. Measure harmonic frequencies and levels at the point where power is supplied into the VFD, using a power quality clamp meter or power quality analyzer. Also, check for harmonics back at the feeder where the power to the VFD is also supplying other loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The solution: If voltage unbalance is the problem, shift and evenly distribute single-phase loads. If harmonics are found to be the cause, contact the drive manufacturer or a harmonic filter manufacturer and determine and install a properly tuned harmonic filter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Problems with lighting retrofits&lt;br /&gt;
	Nuisance tripping:&lt;/strong&gt; Without a doubt, lighting retrofits save money on the monthly electric utility bill. But many facilities invest in lighting upgrades only to find lights flickering or not operating at all. Seemingly unrelated, three-phase motors overheat, servers and computers malfunction, and data is lost. Nuisance trips on circuit breakers suddenly begin occurring. Newly installed electronic equipment mysteriously trips on overvoltage or overtemperature &amp;ndash; yet the equipment does not show any signs of such abnormal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such problems are generally associated with harmonics. One IEEE study indicates that these harmonics can become a significant issue if fluorescent lighting comprises 25 percent or more of the facility load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electronic ballasts often introduce harmonic currents back into the distribution system. If the facility is an older one and only one neutral wire was pulled in for each of the three ungrounded phase conductors to the lighting circuit (sharing neutrals), the result may be overheating neutral conductors, panelboards and transformers. Maintenance often finds and corrects these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A tip: Pull-in additional neutral conductors, one per phase total as needed. Infrared thermography can often identify these issues before failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Dimmer controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Common retrofits to T-8 lamps with electronic ballasts and the replacement of incandescent lamps with compact fluorescents (CFLs) both create significant energy savings. For additional energy savings, dim the fluorescent lighting when full light output is not needed. This dimming can be achieved with manual dimmers or with photosensors that sense light level either indoors or outdoors as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure to match the proper type of dimmer control with the ballast and lamp type to be dimmed. Mismatches here can result not only in improperly operating equipment, but in damaged lighting system components, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the type of dimming controls used, additional control wiring operating at zero to 10 volts may be installed. Placing such control wiring too close to power conductors during installation or maintenance can result in erratic lighting control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A tip: Keep control wiring as short as possible during installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automated lighting controls that switch lighting banks off and on erratically after the installation of energy-saving controls should be checked for proper sensor operation. Some photo sensors may have a deadband adjustment available to change the time between lights-off and lights-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Overheating motors: &lt;/strong&gt;As part of the energy savings lighting upgrades, banks of lighting may be switched to save energy. Depending on the circuits switched, phase unbalances could result on three-phase systems. Maintenance gets the call to replace motors that have been destroyed by overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A tip: Check the voltage supplied to the motor during all phases of plant operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maximum voltage unbalance at motor terminals should not exceed 1 percent. Operation of a motor at greater than 5 percent unbalance will probably result in motor damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The best tool for solving problems, after an upgrade, is a well-trained and properly equipped workforce. Knowledge of how the energy-saving application works is the first step in solving associated problems. Review the design, installation and any startup procedures to isolate and correct many problems. As maintenance on the equipment is required, use a logical, systematic approach with the right tools to isolate problems.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip on shaft currents and bearing defects</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Shaft voltages and currents that can affect bearing life have been identified and described in papers dating back to the early 1900s. Various causes such as accidental potential applied to a motor frame, electrostatic charging, shaft magnetization, electric dissymmetry, and common mode voltage can each be responsible for these damaging effects. The rotor, bearings and frame act as a secondary loop for induced currents to flow through the bearings, or via a capacitive network, voltage exists between the rotor and the iron on the stator frame developing a path across the bearing to ground. This common mode voltage can build up on the rotor and shaft to a level where it will arc over at the bearing in an effort to get to ground. When the motor is running slow, the contact of the balls and the race of the bearing allow for a continuous flow of current through the bearing and prevent any voltage build up or arc. However, when the motor is running faster, a thin film of grease will separate the balls from the outer race allowing for a buildup and potentially damaging arc across the conductive grease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Solutions to this problem are isolated bearings, shaft grounding and non-conductive grease. Less popular solutions include Faraday shields, individually tuned filters and very expensive special inverter designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Drive solution boosts energy efficiency at power plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Medium-voltage drives have slashed the energy consumption of two boiler feed pumps at a coal-fired power plant in Germany by 25 percent. The solution increases plant revenues by $800,000 a year and reduces annual CO2 emissions by 10,200 tons.&lt;br /&gt;
	The two ABB high-efficiency ACS 1000 medium-voltage drives control two boiler feed pumps at Unit 6 of the 1,675-megawatt GKM coal-fired power plant at Mannheim, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The pumps each have a rated output of 5.8 megawatts and were installed in the mid-1970s when Unit 6 was constructed. Prior to the ABB solution, the pumps were controlled by hydraulic clutches, which were operating with an efficiency of only 72 percent and were losing more than 1 megawatt of energy per pump.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When Unit 6 was revamped in 2006, GKM concluded that the poor efficiency and high energy losses of the pumps and clutches were no longer sustainable. GKM turned to ABB for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	ABB proposed a modernization package for each pump, comprising an ACS 1000 medium-voltage variable speed drive, an ABB RESIBLOC dry-type transformer and a complete overhaul of the pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/abb021.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The water-cooled ACS 1000 medium-voltage AC drives are housed in air-conditioned containers and on stilts to provide a safe and controlled environment and protect the drives from flooding by the nearby Rhine River.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After two years of trouble-free operation, GKM could confirm a reduction in pump energy consumption of 25 percent, energy that the plant can sell instead of consuming and which is worth $400,000 per pump per year in revenues.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement in energy efficiency has had a corresponding impact on the plant&amp;rsquo;s carbon footprint, lowering its carbon dioxide emissions by 10,200 metric tons a year &amp;ndash; a significant reduction for a fossil-fuel power plant.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	And the overall efficiency of the new pump drive system is a near-perfect 98.5 percent, compared to the inefficient 72 percent of the previous system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The installation has been so successful that GKM subsequently awarded ABB an additional two contracts to install medium-voltage drive systems for the feeder pumps and water circulation pumps at two of the plant&amp;rsquo;s other generating and district heating units.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Coal-fired power plants typically consume between 7 and 15 percent of the energy they generate, with motor-powered applications like pumps accounting for 80 percent of this parasitic consumption.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Electric motor tip on rotor bars</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	During the start-up process, the outer most section of many rotor bar designs can heat up as much as 300 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. The inner most section of the rotor bar closest to the shaft may only heat up 100 degrees C. This creates a warping of the rotor bar and a significant thermal expansion equal to many tons of axial pressure. A bar with a high resistance connection will have less current flowing through it and will not expand at the same rate. This differential expansion and non symmetric heating results in severe stress and an eventual crack. Left unchecked it will produce the same environment for a stress fracture due to differential expansion on the bar in the next slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip on spectral band alarms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When reviewing spectral data rich with peaks from an unknown origin, consider establishing band alarms around these peaks. Properly designed and applied band alarms allow varied severity indications for a range of frequencies. If the application being monitored is operating in an otherwise healthy condition, then an increase of 25 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent from baseline could be used for observe, caution and severe setpoints, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Toshiba to build drive motors for electrified vehicles in U.S.</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toshiba Corporation will expand manufacturing capacity at its plant in Houston for production of high-performance drive motors for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The production will be Toshiba&amp;#39;s first overseas manufacturing base for automotive propulsion motors which are currently produced in Mie Prefecture, Japan. The decision follows the awarding of a major contract to supply drive motors for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles for Ford Motor Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Toshiba recognizes the importance of localizing production within North America to ensure long-term growth and make a commitment to the North American market,&amp;quot; said Shinichiro Akiba, president, Toshiba International Corporation, a Houston-based Toshiba Group company that manufactures and markets motors and industrial equipment, and the base for this expansion program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We welcome Toshiba&amp;#39;s decision to locate this new production in the United States,&amp;quot; said Sherif Marakby, director of electrification programs and engineering, Ford Motor Company. &amp;quot;This key technology will help build U.S. capacity and supply of components to further enable vehicle electrification in the North American market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toshiba will begin construction for the expanded capacity in January 2011 in Houston on the site of Toshiba International Corporation. Production of the automotive motors would begin in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the automotive industry moves toward a new generation of environmentally friendly vehicles including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles, Toshiba is promoting advances in essential automotive technologies, from dedicated on-board control systems to batteries and Intelligent Traffic Systems. The company&amp;#39;s development of key components for HEVs, PHEVs and EVs, including inverters and drive motors, is an essential part of Toshiba&amp;#39;s strategy in growing this promising business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Scientists design motorcycle engines powered by compressed air</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most motorcycles in the world today use engines that burn gasoline, contributing to greenhouse gasses and adding air pollution to the surrounding area. Now two scientists in India have conceptually designed a new, cleaner motorcycle engine that uses compressed air to turn a small air turbine, generating enough power to run a motorcycle for up to 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their design, described in a recent issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy&lt;/em&gt;, could be combined with a compressed air cylinder as a replacement for traditional internal combustion engines. In areas where motorcycles are a major source of public transportation, such a technology could cut emissions substantially if widely implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Bharat Raj Singh, one of the two authors on the paper and a researcher at the SMS Institute of Technology in Lucknow, India, some 50 to 60 percent of present emissions in some areas could be reduced with the new technology, though a number of technical challenges remain. Designing a compact but high-capacity air tank to store sufficient &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; for long rides is a major hurdle. Existing tanks would require someone to stop about every 30 kilometer (19 miles) to swap tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The article, &amp;quot;Study of the influence of vane angle on shaft output of a multivane air turbine&amp;quot; by Bharat Raj Singh and Onkar Singh was published May 6, 2010 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy&lt;/em&gt;.

            <title>The relationship between voltage and current in electric motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Current imbalance can occur for a variety of reasons &amp;ndash; high-resistance connection, low loading, dissimilar cable sizes, transformer anomalies, winding failures, and voltage imbalance, to name a few. Due to the variety of causes, current imbalance is a good burglar alarm, but further investigation and root cause analysis is necessary to get to the source. One rule of thumb to help when you&amp;#39;re troubleshooting a motor with a high current imbalance is that for every 1 percent voltage imbalance you can estimate approximately 7 percent current imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Methods to optimize electric motor efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Widely publicized estimates show that systems driven by electric motors consume more than half of the electricity produced in the United States and more than 70 percent of the electricity used in many industrial plants.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Now that energy and operating costs are at a premium, it makes more sense than ever to increase motor efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many facilities find it makes sense to divide their motor efficiency strategy into three phases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overall assessment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Immediate improvements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Long-term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article briefly outlines Step 1 and provides details on Step 2. An upcoming article will provide details for Step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke021.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Methods to optimize electric motor efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1: Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s what a motor assessment involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Survey and document how many motors, at what age, horsepower and ratings, with what level of controls are present in your facility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the highest and most critical loads.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		For those key units, use a power logger to evaluate their energy consumption (power draw).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This will give you a general energy-consumption map for motors in your facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2: Immediate improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	There are two kinds of immediate improvements that you can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Changes to the units and to unit operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changes to the units may include replacing some motors with higher-efficiency or better-sized models, adding controls to others to right-size output, and rescheduling which motors run when compared to demand and utility rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To determine whether any of these changes make sense in your facility, use a motor efficiency calculator such as MotorMaster+ from the U.S. Department of Energy. It can help you calculate savings per motor and per efficiency step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Otherwise, there are three inspection points that you should make to all motors that you intend to keep operational:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Voltage unbalance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Current unbalance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Power factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If tests show problems with any of these three variables, correcting those problems can yield immediate efficiency improvements. Logically, you should also incorporate these tests into long-term regular maintenance to sustain any short-term improvements you make at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voltage unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Voltage unbalance is a measure of voltage differences among the phases of a three-phase system. For optimum motor performance, the phase voltages should be equal or very close to equal. Besides causing poor motor performance, voltage unbalance shortens a motor&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Voltage unbalance is 100 times the maximum voltage variation from average divided by the average voltage of the three phases. This calculation produces the unbalance as a percentage. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) presents the following example:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; If measured line voltages are 462 V, 463 V and 455 V, the average is 460 V. So, the voltage unbalance is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;[(460 &amp;ndash; 455) x 100] &amp;divide; 460 = 1.1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overall, voltage unbalance should be less than 1 percent and never more than 5 percent. Standard EN50160 requires less than 2 percent voltage unbalance at the point of common coupling. National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) specifications call for less than 5 percent for motor loads, but recommend that voltage unbalances at motor terminals not exceed 1 percent and that the motors be derated for higher percentages.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring for voltage unbalance should be performed regularly at motor terminals using a power quality analyzer to verify that voltage unbalance is below 5 percent. In addition, regular thermal inspections might reveal high-resistance connections in the switchgear, disconnects or motor connection boxes, which can cause voltage unbalance. Other possible sources of voltage unbalance include faulty power-factor correction devices, unbalanced or inconsistent supply voltages, unbalanced transformer banks, unevenly distributed single-phase loads, single-phase to ground faults or an open circuit on a distribution system primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Corrections should be done by an experienced electrician or power specialist. Begin by checking supply voltages from the adjustable speed drive (if one is used in the system). Also, check utility inputs to the plant and transformer outputs to the system. If balanced phases are found at these &amp;ldquo;sources,&amp;rdquo; then the best approach is to begin at the motor and systematically work back to the initial source, the utility&amp;rsquo;s electric supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Potential savings and ROI: &lt;/strong&gt;The best way to calculate overall savings is to use a software tool such as MotorMaster+. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the basic calculation works, if you know the following (sample values appear in parentheses):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loading on the motor (100%)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Horsepower (100 hp)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Run time (8,000 hours per year)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficiency at nominal unbalance for the loading (94.4%)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficiency at actual unbalance and loading (93%)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One horsepower converts to 0.746 kilowatts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Using the sample values provided, the annual energy savings (AEs) following corrective action would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;AEs = 100 hp x 0.746 kW/hp x 8,000 hr/yr x (100 &amp;divide; 93 &amp;ndash; 100 &amp;divide; 94.4) = 9,517 kWh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	If electricity costs $0.05 per kWh, the annual saving in dollars (AS$) will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;AS$ = 9,517 kWh x $0.50/kWh = $476/yr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In industrial settings, many motors may be powered from the same unbalanced power supply. Therefore, potential savings will be much more than for a single motor, with the actual savings dependent on loading, run times, horsepower, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, remember that motors run hotter when their power supplies are unbalanced; roughly twice the square of the voltage unbalance (2 x % voltage unbalance). For example, at 2 percent voltage unbalance, a motor will experience an 8 degree Celsius temperature rise. Every operating temperature increase of 10 degrees C halves the life of motor-winding insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Current unbalance is a measure of difference in current drawn by a motor on each leg of a three-phase system. Correcting current unbalance helps prevent overheating and the deterioration of motor-winding insulation. The draw on each leg should be equal or close to equal. One cause of current unbalance is voltage unbalance, which can cause current unbalance far out of proportion to the voltage unbalance itself. When current unbalance occurs in the absence of voltage unbalance, look for another cause of the current unbalance (e.g., faulty insulation or a phase shorted to ground).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Current unbalance is calculated the same way as voltage unbalance. It is 100 times the maximum current variation from average divided by the average current of the three phases. So, if the measured current is 30 amps, 35 amps and 30 amps, the average is 31.7 amps, and the current unbalance is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;[(35 &amp;ndash; 31.7) x 100] &amp;divide; 31.7 = 10.4%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Current unbalance for three-phase motors should not exceed 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring current unbalance should involve an experienced electrician or power specialist. As with voltage unbalance, it should be performed regularly at motor terminals using a power quality analyzer. The two measurements for unbalance &amp;ndash; voltage and current &amp;ndash; can be made and saved simultaneously with the same power quality analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Correcting current unbalance might include any or all of the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the unbalance is the result of the supplied power, a power-factor correction device can solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If the problem is the motor itself, due, for example, to faulty insulation or a phase shorted to ground, carefully weigh your options. The decision to repair (rewind) a motor vs. replacing it with a new one is difficult. According to the DOE&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;hellip;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Rewinding almost always reduces a motor&amp;rsquo;s efficiency and reliability. Consider such variables as rewind cost, expected rewind losses, new motor purchase price (for both standard and energy-efficient models), motor size and original efficiency, load factor, annual operating hours, electricity price, availability of a utility rebate and simple payback criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		In most cases, buy a new motor if:
		&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				the faulty motor is less than 40 horsepower and more than 15 years old, especially if it has been previously rewound,&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				the motor is a non-specialty motor of less than 15 horsepower, or&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				the rewind cost is more than 50 percent of the cost of a new motor.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the latter case, increased efficiency and reliability should provide a fast return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Potential savings and ROI:&lt;/strong&gt; ROI takes two forms &amp;ndash; energy savings and long-term production savings (preventing motor failure and downtime). Possible utility rebates also come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy savings can be difficult to determine, especially when rewinding is the chosen solution. Final rewind losses are unknown until after rewinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you decide to buy a new motor, use MotorMaster+ software to calculate the annual energy savings (AS$) you can expect from the replacement. You need the following information:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Motor rated horsepower (hp)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Load factor (L = percentage of full load &amp;divide; 100)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Annual operating hours (hr)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average energy costs (C = $/kWh)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Existing motor efficiency (Estd, as a percentage)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficiency rating of the new motor (Eee, as a percentage)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The conversion factor from hp to kW (0.746)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given this information,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;AS$ = hp x L x 0.746 x hr x C x [(100 &amp;divide; Estd) &amp;ndash; (100 &amp;divide; Eee)]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general, premium-efficiency motors are about 1 percent more efficient than standard efficiency motors, and the energy savings will typically result in a payback period of less than 18 months. Compared to an existing rewound unit, a new premium efficiency motor will be considerably more than 1 percent more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power factor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Bad power factor is generated by some types of equipment operation and results in penalty fees from the utility. Evaluate power factor on all major circuits and loads, including motors. The closer your power factor is to 100 percent, or &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;, the better (utilities usually charge a penalty for power factor less than 95 percent). Increasing your power factor will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce your electric bill&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase electrical system capacity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Decrease voltage drop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Power factor (PF) is caused by inductive loads (loads with coils) such as motors and transformers. It is expressed as a percentage or a number, with 100 percent, or 1, being ideal. Power factor is the ratio of real (working) power (kilowatts kW) to apparent (total) power (kilovolt-amps kVA). Apparent power is a combination of real power and reactive power (kilovars kVAR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An increase in reactive power causes the apparent power to increase and, consequently, power factor to decrease. So, decreasing reactive power will increase power factor, and that&amp;rsquo;s generally a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Measuring power factor is best done with a power-quality analyzer. Before starting, find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How your utility charges for low power factor or VARs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What the utility says your power factor averages per month&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What your demand charge is&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How the utility measures power factor or VARs: peak intervals or averages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The goal is to identify loads that are causing lagging reactive power and develop a strategy for improving power factor.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Start at the service entrance, where the utility monitors its data, and check individual loads. The power-quality analyzer will allow you to find the average power factor over a specific recording period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Correct power factor using the following strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Curtail or decrease the use of idling or lightly loaded motors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Avoid operating motors above their rated voltage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Replace failed standard motors with energy-efficient models&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Install capacitors in the affected circuit(s) to decrease reactive power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Potential savings and ROI: &lt;/strong&gt;Use the information from the utility and from your investigation to calculate your savings. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume your utility adds a 1 percent demand charge for each 1 percent your power factor is below 0.97 percent. If your power factor averages 86 percent each month, then your operation is 11 percent (97 percent minus 86 percent) below the 97 percent threshold. If your demand charge is $7,000 per month, then your avoidable annual cost via power factor correction equals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;(11% x $7,000 per month) x 12 months = $9,240&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As you wrap-up your immediate motor efficiency investigation, evaluate your long-term maintenance practices and start making changes there, too. Include these same voltage and current unbalance checks in regular inspections. Also consider regularly inspecting connections and grounds, off-design voltage, and insulation resistance, for additional long-term performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The case for hollow shaft torque motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;rsquo;s machine designer must evaluate more factors than ever in approaching a new project. Likewise, the integrator and retrofit engineer has expanded options, not only as a result of new technologies, but also because of critical areas of focus such as reduced energy consumption, faster assembly time, vendor reduction and smaller footprint achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the realm of motion control, one type of motor with a relatively short history has made significant advancements that necessitate a new look at its potential in many application areas. These applications range from machine tool rotary tables to various packaging, printing, converting, extruding, papermaking, plastic film and materials handling machinery, anywhere direction must be reversed with a very high degree of accuracy, no backlash (hysteresis) and the maintaining of motion control, contrasting the necessary decoupling of a conventional motor and gearbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enter the often-overlooked permanent magnet, synchronous torque motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque motors are direct drives built for rotary axes where high torque and high precision are required at relatively low speeds. With significantly lower installation time, maintenance requirements, component part count and space allowance, these motor types are frequently viable alternatives to geared motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two popular varieties of torque motors exist today. They are the complete torque motor, requiring only direct flange-mounting to the machine and connection of the rotor to the machine shaft, and the built-in torque motor, where the stator and rotor are supplied as individual components that are directly integrated into the machine mechanics.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Complete torque motors are often found on extruder main drives, feed heads on injection molding machines, roller drives on papermaking machines, wire drawing devices, textile machine web stretching and winders/cross cutters on packaging equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Built-in torque motors are typically used on machine tool rotary tables, swivel axes, dynamic tool turrets and turning spindles, as well as printing press cylinders, chill rolls in cast film and foil stretching machines, indexing tables in metalforming presses and all other types of high-dynamic, high-precision path and speed control applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both types of torque motors feature a hollow shaft, which allows media or mechanical components to be guided through the rotor cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque motors are multiple pair pole synchronous motors, similar in operation to rotary synchronous servo motors. The rotor is equipped with permanent magnets, while the stator contains the motor windings. The high number of pole pairs leads to a design generating high maximum torque at low speeds. In the past, since eddy current losses increase with the number of pole pairs and the running speed of the motor, torque motors were considered applicable only at relatively low speeds. New water-cooled designs have countered this principle, allowing a high power density. Today&amp;rsquo;s torque motors can accommodate speeds of 1000 rpm or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these higher pole pair designs and because many mechanical power transmission components that generate backlash, heat, friction and noise are eliminated, torque motors offer these benefits to designers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		small footprint due to high torque density;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		excellent rotational accuracy and repeatability due to direct load control;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		space-saving machine designs, due to the elimination of gear units and belt transmissions;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		low maintenance a direct result of having fewer mechanical parts in the drivetrain; and,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		high energy efficiency because mechanical losses in the drivetrain are eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While higher in cost than geared motors, it is currently estimated that torque motors offer the designer a payback of three to four years in energy savings alone, which does not include the immediate increased performance and upfront cost savings, both in installation and maintenance. Obvious vendor reduction and inventory advantages are also realized through the use of these motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On a typical multi-layer blown film line, for example, the use of torque motors can reduce the footprint of the extrusion section by half and the consumed production space decreases accordingly, leading to an increase in production rates per square foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque motors were also long thought to be susceptible to chemical and other ambient atmospheric contamination, but new designs have been adapted to withstand corrosive atmospheres such as a paper mill dry hood and, being water-cooled, are performing satisfactorily in many harsh environments without heat damage. Enclosures are available up to an IP54 rating with overload capability up to 2.5 times the rated torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Torque motors reduce mechanical efficiency losses to an absolute minimum because they eliminate mechanical transmission in the drivetrain. Compared to geared motor solutions, the efficiency gain is typically in the range of 10 percent, while the gain is closer to 70 percent when hydraulic motors are replaced in applications such as injection molding machines. Further, due to the direct and constant control of the load shaft on torque motors, with no backlash or decoupling occurring, a significantly higher precision in motion is achieved, which is not possible in a geared or belt-driven solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, in the production of stretched film, the application of torque motors on chill rolls, pull rolls, stretch rolls and winders has resulted in a dramatic improvement in production quality. The more accurate speed control of the direct driven rolls results in faster start-ups during the changeover from one film product to another, because the likelihood of cracks in the web is minimized. In addition, the higher control accuracy enables the production of a thinner film that is 10 times more consistent in its thickness. Likewise, the stiff drivetrain configuration achieved with torque motors allows faster ramping up and down in cyclic applications, leading to shorter cycles and increased product output in the same time period. In many applications with very short cyclic times, such as indexing tables or injection molding machines, the changeover from conventional drives to direct driven solutions has resulted in production increases of 25 to 30 percent typically. These results indicate that a lower component count now means a lower product lifecycle cost, as well as reduced potential failure rates in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other features on today&amp;rsquo;s torque motors that make them more appealing for the machine designer include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		absolute value or incremental encoders or resolvers for enhanced&lt;br /&gt;
		motion control&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		electronic nameplate for faster commissioning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		horizontal or vertical mounting options&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		bearing options for axial thrust applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PTC resistors in each phase, in addition to standard KTY thermistors for optimum temp monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The emerging science of mechatronics is also critical for direct drives such as torque and linear motors in the integration process because the electronic machine control protocols are so crucial in monitoring and executing the electromechanical motions. A keen knowledge of three disciplines (mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering) is fundamental in determining the proper unit to suit the load. Mechatronics addresses such topics for the machine builder as proper encoder location, reaction vs. dynamic force calculations and how best to integrate a high dynamic direct drive mechanically into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, through various advanced computerized simulation techniques, mechatronic performance can be validated and troubleshooting on the design can be accomplished before the first machine is ever built. Even in the field, before and after a retrofit or rebuild, the mechatronic services currently available can be used for product application determination, full performance analysis and controls compatibility. While the performance of a new motor or drive might be deemed satisfactory by mechatronic analysis, other mechanical, electrical or electronic components might be found lacking. It is precisely this comprehensive, integrated approach that is fast earning mechatronics its place in the overall scheme of machine development and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, with today&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on cost containment, energy efficiency and higher productivity on every type of machine design, it is imperative that all viable options be explored. In designing the drivetrain on many machines, the advantages of torque motors described in this paper will have a positive impact on the overall project results. Torque motors can offer great flexibility in design, retrofit and rebuild applications, plus they have expanded capabilities that lobby for their implementation on more types of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE launches worldâs first two-stage turbocharged gas engine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Responding to growing global demand for high-efficiency power generation, GE has developed the world&amp;rsquo;s first two-stage turbocharged gas engine and is applying this game-changing technology to its Jenbacher J624 gas engine. The new engine provides significant output and efficiency increases compared to the single turbocharged version and is particularly well-suited for operation in hot environments and combined heat and power (CHP) applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was introduced at an official product launch event held today at GE&amp;rsquo;s gas engine headquarters in Jenbach, Austria, which more than 35 customers and distributors attended. Representatives from the pilot customer for the first new engine, Red Harvest, a large Dutch greenhouse plant operator, also attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are proud to be the pilot customer for this new J624 gas engine with two-stage turbocharging,&amp;quot; says Jaap Noordam, owner of Red Harvest. &amp;quot;The new engine not only provides us with higher efficiency, but also offers us higher flexibility for our CHP operations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the new system, which GE developed with specialists from ABB Turbo Systems Ltd, the J624 achieves approximately 10 percent higher output, increasing from 4 megawatts (MW) to 4.4 MW and offers an electrical efficiency of 46.5 percent, an increase of about 1 percentage point. Improved efficiency is critical for the competitive cost of electricity and for the reduction of CO2 emissions in a carbon-constrained environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With this technology breakthrough, GE continues to lead innovation in gas engines and has become the first gas engine manufacturer using two-stage turbocharging technology, enabling us to offer our customers significant performance improvements. While this technology initially is being applied to our largest gas engine, the J624, eventually it will be offered with other engines in our portfolio,&amp;rdquo; said Prady Iyyanki, CEO of gas engines for GE Power &amp;amp; Water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Introduced by GE in 2007, the J624 is the world&amp;rsquo;s first 24-cylinder gas engine for commercial power generation, used in various applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The J624 two-stage turbocharged is a real-game changer, especially for applications in countries with hot and humid conditions,&amp;rdquo; Iyyanki added. &amp;ldquo;The advanced boost pressure allows us to significantly push the gas engine operating range and maintain full output and efficiency at high ambient temperatures and high elevations. We view this enabling technology as a key for future success in the gas engine business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two-stage turbocharging offers a much higher charging efficiency, which significantly contributes to the engine&amp;rsquo;s overall increased efficiency. In addition to the higher charging pressure, this technology also significantly improves the power density of the engine allowing it to run beyond 22 bar BMEP* (brake mean effective pressure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applications for the new two-stage turbocharged gas engine include independent power producers, CHP, trigeneration and special applications using natural gas fuel, as well as a wide range of non-natural gas fuels. The new engine will be available to customers worldwide by the summer of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;* BMEP, Brake Mean Effective Pressure is a quantity used by engineers to compare the performance of different internal combustion engines. It is a valuable measure of an engine&amp;#39;s capacity to do work that is independent of engine displacement, thought as the average pressure over a cycle in the combustion chamber of the engine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/bY8dJLbxr3A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ABB solution boosts power plant energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ABB medium-voltage drives have slashed the energy consumption of two boiler feed pumps at a coal-fired power plant in Germany by 25 percent. The solution increases plant revenues by $800,000 a year and reduces annual CO2 emissions by 10,200 tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The two ABB high-efficiency ACS 1000 medium-voltage drives control two boiler feed pumps at unit 6 of the 1,675 megawatt GKM coal-fired power plant at Mannheim, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The pumps each have a rated output of 5.8 megawatts and were installed in the mid-1970s when unit 6 was constructed. Prior to the ABB solution the pumps were controlled by hydraulic clutches, which were operating with an efficiency of only 72 percent and were losing more than 1 megawatt of energy per pump.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When unit 6 was revamped in 2006, GKM concluded that the poor efficiency and high energy losses of the pumps and clutches were no longer sustainable. GKM turned to ABB for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	ABB proposed a modernization package for each pump comprising an ACS 1000 medium-voltage variable speed drive, an ABB RESIBLOC&amp;reg; dry-type transformer and a complete overhaul of the pumps.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img border="0" height="299" src="http://www04.abb.com/global/seitp/seitp202.nsf/0/906980d3aae34a14c125773700316de2/$file/GKM_drives.jpg" width="528" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="centerborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;" width="260"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			The water-cooled ACS 1000 medium-voltage AC drives are housed in air-conditioned containers and on stilts to provide a safe and controlled environment and protect the drives from flooding by the nearby Rhine river.
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After two years of trouble-free operation GKM could confirm a reduction in pump energy consumption of 25 percent, energy that the plant can sell instead of consuming and which is worth $400,000 per pump per year in revenues.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The improvement in energy efficiency has had a corresponding impact on the plant&amp;rsquo;s carbon footprint, lowering its carbon dioxide emissions by 10,200 metric tons a year &amp;ndash; a significant reduction for a fossil-fuel power plant.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	And the overall efficiency of the new pump drive system is a near-perfect 98.5 percent, compared to the inefficient 72 percent of the previous system.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The installation has been so successful that GKM subsequently awarded ABB an additional two contracts to install medium-voltage drive systems for the feeder pumps and water circulation pumps at two of the plant&amp;rsquo;s other generating and district heating units.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Coal-fired power plants typically consume between 7 and 15 percent of the energy they generate, with motor-powered applications like pumps accounting for 80 percent of this parasitic consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/QKIuLFQocmY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Electric motors tip: Little things make big things happen</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Often, when performing power circuit analysis using precision bridge resistance measurements of our large electric motors, we see values of resistance that are very small. Some of these are down in the milliohm or even micro ohm range. These actual resistance values can vary greatly with changes in temperature. However, the balance calculation between the three values on a three phase induction motor should not. A change in the resistance imbalance from .08% to .8% doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a lot when in fact it is a 900% increase. This stresses the importance of getting good baseline data early for good trending and comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Detect machine problems early: Best practices for operators</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When working around equipment for a long time, it is easy to become accustomed to it working as it should. It can make us numb to potential problems, especially if they come on gradually. This article will present some techniques that will allow you to detect problems early, and hopefully eliminate downtime and/or reduce maintenance costs. Further, it will give insight into what is in common driven equipment and their drivers. How a centrifugal and positive displacement pump works will be explained in the simplest of terms. Some important relationships of flow, heat and horsepower are highlighted so troubleshooting can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This article will outline lubrication systems, bearings, drivers, and both centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. The one secret to detecting problems early is to know what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; is. The operator is one of the few people who knows how a piece of equipment is supposed to sound, what the pressure normally produced is, and what the equipment feels like when it is doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Types of lubrication systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Splash &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; This type of lubrication system is one that usually consists of a reservoir of oil and some part of the spinning shaft and attachment, or the rolling elements of the bearing, that touch the oil and cause it to splash to allow lubrication to take place. There is a place to check the oil level, and it is most important for operators to ensure there is oil.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ring&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This lubrication is accomplished by use of a large ring, usually brass, riding on the turning shaft. It dips down into the oil reservoir and, by viscous drag, brings oil up onto the shaft where it is distributed along the shaft to the bearing. As above, there is a place to check the oil level and it is most important for operators to ensure that oil is present. There also is usually a place to look at the ring while the piece of equipment is running. This should be viewed often to ensure the ring is turning; if the ring stops, the lubrication also will stop.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Circulating &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; In this type of lubricating system, there is usually a reservoir, a pump, a filter, and it may or may not have a heat exchanger. It supplies oil to the lubricated item at very low or essentially no pressure. It is used when a control flow of clean lubricant is necessary to one or more places that may not be at the same level as the reservoir. It is very similar to a forced-feed lubrication system but uses its pump to circulate oil only. Check the level in the reservoir and the color of the lubricant. If there are changes, the question &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; should always come to mind. If there is a heat exchanger, it should be clean. In Figure 1, the circulating system heat exchanger should be cleaned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Forced&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This system is very similar to the circulating system, but it does operate at a system pressure. It usually has a pressure regulating valve to maintain pressure on the system, and it has coolers, multiple pumps, a pressure regulator, auto start of the standby pump, filters and a reservoir. This system is required to remain at pressure or the equipment to which it is supplying lubrication will fail. There are usually safety switches that will cause the lubricated piece of equipment to shut down if the level in the tank falls below a set amount, or if the pressure in the system becomes too low. In addition to the checks of the circulating system, additional checks should be made, such as: &amp;ldquo;Are both the main and auxiliary oil pumps running?&amp;rdquo; If so, why? What is the system pressure? Is it normal? Touch the discharge side of the relief valve on the discharge of the pump. Is it relieving? It should not be. See Figure 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 2 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Oil mist&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a system that consists of a tank, tubing and piping to each item being lubricated, an atomizer, and various safety devices relating to flow and level in the reservoir. With this system, there may or may not be a level in the lubricated piece of equipment. There are two general types of mist systems. One is pure mist where there is no lubricant reservoir in each piece of equipment. The other type is a purge mist system where there is a level in the lubricated piece of equipment and oil mist fills the &amp;ldquo;air&amp;rdquo; space above the reservoir to control that atmosphere. See Figure 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 3 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Automatic grease lubricators&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; These are often used to grease inaccessible places. They have a timing mechanism that can be electronic, chemical or mechanical. They may or may not put out much pressure, so they can be prevented from delivering lubricant in some instances. It is important for these lubricators to be marked on their reservoirs with a permanent marker line with the lubricant level and a date as to when the lubricant was at that level. It is one of the few ways to know that lubricant is being put to what is being lubricated. The operator then has a visual reference as to if lubricant is being provided. If the lubricant is being delivered slowly, it should be remarked every few months with a new line and dated to ensure lubricant is being delivered. See Figure 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 4 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Lubrication:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Lubrication is one of the most important aspects of rotating equipment. It is also the neglect of lubrication that causes many pieces of equipment to fail. Lubrication performs the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Entirely separates moving surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Removes heat generated within the bearing and/or from an outside source&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Protects metals from corrosion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Flushes away contaminants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Dampens noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 5 illustrates the difference between full fluid film lubrication with complete separation of surfaces and boundary layer lubrication. Boundary layer lubrication is where there is oil present but not sufficient to keep all surfaces separated, and some wear does take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 5 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From an inspection view, it is important to notice the following properties of the lubricant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				It is important to notice changes in the lubricant, smell, color and level.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the reservoir is small and an oil leak is detected, check the level immediately as not much leakage can be tolerated before the level is dangerously low.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the color has changed significantly from yesterday, or what you know to be normal, find out why.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Ensure that levels are maintained. This problem will cause equipment to fail catastrophically in a relatively short period of time if not corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				If the level is increasing, find out why; water may be entering the system. A simple test is to drain some of the lubricant out onto a napkin or paper towel. The oil will be absorbed into towel but the water beads will stand on the oil soaked towel.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Bearings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Plain:&lt;/strong&gt; These are a general category of simple bearings. They can also be called sleeved bearings and, in its simplest form, bushings. They consist of a bearing material that is stationary usually and a rotating shaft. They may be lubricated by any of the above methods of lubrication and are a very common bearing, especially in large, heavy, rotored machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		One type of plain bearing is called the pillow block bearing. Many of these have water connections going into them for cooling. It normally consists of a water in and water out line on the same side of the bearing and a loop or &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo; on the other side. Many times, these are rubber hoses and after years exposed to the outside elements they can dry and crack, allowing a leak which reduces the cooling water to the bearing. Where these connections enter, the pillow block bearing can become poorly sealed, allowing the elements to enter the bearing oil; or if the hose is leaking, the leakage can enter the bearing oil and result in a bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Rolling element:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a large group of bearings including roller, tapered roller, ball and needle. They can be lubricated by either grease or oil depending on the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. If a frictionless type of bearing is known to be hot, do not put a water hose on it. The water could get into the lubricant and the cooling water on the outer housing will shrink. The result will likely be the elimination of internal clearances and may cause the bearing to seize immediately. Figure 6 lists numerous bearing types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 6 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Motors: &lt;/strong&gt;This is likely the most common type of driver for not only pumps but many other types of equipment found in industry. They consist of two major components. The rotating element inside the motor is called the rotor, and the stationary housing is called the stator. The stator has the electrical wiring in it, and most industry uses three-phase power. From an operations point of view, the three-phase power means that if any two leads are moved to a new mounting location externally at the connection to the power source, the direction of the motor will be reversed. This is really important because many types of equipment must turn in one direction. That is why the direction of rotation is checked before the coupling is installed between the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		As a general rule, if you touch a motor and it is too hot to keep your hand on, it is likely that it is running too hot. The fins on the outside of a motor are to aid with cooling. These should be clean and clear of debris and insulation. A rule of thumb is that motors that run hotter will likely have a shorter life than one running cooler. There are many factors in determining &amp;ldquo;too&amp;rdquo; hot, such as the class of insulation and load on the motor at a given time. The best analysis is done by knowing what is normal and detecting a significant change. When the change is noted, get additional information as to the significance of the change; that would include help from an acknowledged professional as to insulation type and acceptable upper limit of operation. The motor will not fail immediately as the higher temperatures are reached, but running at the higher temperatures is cumulative. It will eventually cause the motor life to be shortened. If you have large motors with an enclosure for outdoors, ensure that the screens or filters that are supposed to be kept clean stay clean. If not, the temperatures will go up and the motor life can be significantly reduced. Figure 7 is a totally enclosed fan-cooled motor (TEFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Steam Turbines:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam turbines are another common driver for industrial equipment. They act like a child&amp;rsquo;s pinwheel in the wind. The turbine may have multiple &amp;ldquo;pinwheels&amp;rdquo;, or stages, and the wind is normally replaced by steam. The shafts are sealed by some means of trying to keep the steam from leaking out to the atmosphere. This is done to save the heated and treated water and to keep the steam from going where you do not want it. If the steam seals are leaking badly, it is not uncommon for the steam to enter the bearing housings and condense. The water will return with the oil to the reservoir. And since the oil pumps draw near the bottom of the tank eventually if allowed to continue, the oil pumps will be circulating water or a mixture of water and oil, which are not good lubricants. If visible steam is seen leaking out, the reservoir should be checked to insure that large quantities of water are not accumulating in the reservoir. Just remember that when visible steam is being seen, check lubricant reservoirs to ensure the water is not displacing the lubricant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If there is cooling water being supplied to the bearing area, touch the inlet and outlet water lines to ensure heat exchange is taking place or at least flow is taking place. Watch for oil leaks as the oil may collect in the insulation and come in contact with the hot piping or casing and a fire will result.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Notice if the turbine seems to vibrate more with it rains that when the day is sunny. The insulation may allow water to enter and cool the casing in an uneven manner, affecting alignment and how smoothly the turbine runs. No one but operators will likely notice the set of cause and affects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Gearboxes:&lt;/strong&gt; These are often used when there is a large difference between the speed of the driver and the driven piece of equipment. From an operator or casual point of view, the items that are most notable when passing are the sound the gear is making and the temperature and vibration of the gearbox to the touch. This needs to be compared to what it has been. Remember, we are looking for changes from what is or accepted as normal. Always check foundation bolts by looking for oil being squeezed in and out between the base plate and the foot of the gearbox. Look at the shims as well. Do they look like they have been squirming out? This is a potential sign of looseness or high vibration at some time. Figure 9 is an example of a parallel shaft gearbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Heat exchangers: &lt;/strong&gt;A heat exchanger is a device built for efficient heat transfer from one medium to another, whether the media are separated by a solid wall so that they never mix, or the media are in direct contact. One of the most common types of heat exchangers in the oil and petrochemical industry is the shell and tube. A severely fowled tube is shown in figure below. The fowling will reduce flow and affect the ability of the exchanger to exchange heat. Figure 10 is an example of a shell and tube heat exchanger and Figure 11 is a badly fowled exchanger tube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Driven: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Only centrifugal and positive displacement pumps will be discussed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Centrifugal pump &lt;/strong&gt;(Figure 12 is a generic centrifugal pump): These are one of the most common types of pumps in industry. They can be of the open or closed impeller type, and may be single or multiple stages. They use the principal of increasing the velocity of the fluid being pumped and Bernoulli&amp;rsquo;s principle to develop pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 12 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps consist of a shaft with bearings for support and an impeller as well as a pump casing and a method of sealing the spinning shaft to keep the liquid being pumped from getting into the atmosphere. The pump has the relationships as listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember in centrifugal pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pressure is increasing on the discharge pressure gauge, the flow is likely decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, then the horsepower required is increasing. That can be shown by increasing amps or kilowatts.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity is increasing, the discharge pressure will fall and the horsepower required to pump the fluid will increase.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR will also increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Typical pump curve&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 13)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 13 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Positive displacement pumps&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 14)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 14 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		A positive displacement pump is one that, as it turns, liquid is ejected from the pump. As the pump is turned faster, more liquid is ejected from the pump. In this pump, flow on the discharge side of the pump must never be stopped as something will be damaged. There are many types of positive displacement pumps, but no matter how the pump is configured inside, the results are the same. As the pump turns, the liquid must have a place to go.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		These pumps have pump curves as do the centrifugal pumps and show much of the same information, but they look differently. Figure 15 is a typical positive displacement pump curve.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 15 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Some useful relationships to remember for positive displacement pumps are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the discharge pressure is rising, the horsepower required to pump is also rising.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the pump is required to put out more gallons per minute, then the speed of the pump must be increased.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the viscosity of the fluid is increasing, then the horsepower required to pump it is also increasing.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;
					If the flow is increasing, the NPSHR also must increase to prevent cavitation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques available to operators and field people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These inspections are done during rounds. Listen to the equipment and notice differences over time. In motors, a loud hum may mean an internal motor problem or potentially a soft foot condition. If it was quiet yesterday and noisy today, what happened to cause the change? Squealing belts can indicate an overload condition or just loose belts. A scraping sound or rhythmic sound can indicate a dragging or rubbing. A broken tooth on a gearbox may be detected by a clicking or regularly reoccurring sound from inside the gearbox. If a ringing sound is heard, it is important to find the source and ensure that it is not something that will cause a problem with the piece of equipment. Sometimes putting a listening device on a piece of equipment can help identify the source of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Bad or poorly lubricated bearing can be heard using the auditable techniques listed. This is especially useful on frictionless types of bearings. Rubs and other noise-producing maladies can be detected in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Look for leaks; look at fluid levels, burned paint, vibrating shafts or housings. Paint burns at about 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 230 degrees Celsius); and if that is near lubricating oil, then it is likely that the oil has gotten that hot as well. That could mean the condition of the oil is no longer viable as a lubricant. Look at motor fan guards for blockage and the fins on TEFC motors to ensure cooling can take place.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Ensure that pressure gauges are installed and working. The most accurate readings are when the pressure of interest is between the 10 and 2 o&amp;rsquo;clock position on the gauge. It is most important to know what the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; pressure is for any piece of operating equipment. Look for signs of over-lubrication. This condition will not only make a mess, but will shorten equipment life. It is also a potential environmental problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		If equipment is ring oiled, it is generally easy to look at the ring while the equipment is running. This is a good check because if the ring stops turning for any reason, it has the same affect as the oil pump stopping in a forced lubrication system. There will be no lubrication for the bearings. (Figure 16)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;a href="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le Bleu_PHOTOS.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Figure 16 Click Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile inspections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		After making sure you will not be burned, touch the equipment. Notice if it feels like tingling in your fingers; that would indicate a high-frequency or fast-occurring vibration. Is it hot? Is it hotter than the last time you touched it? Is the hot spot localized or generally hot all over? The temperature on the outside of bearing housings is generally less than the temperature of the bearing itself. The actual temperature of the bearing will be about 30 to 50 degrees F (2 to 10 C) higher than the outside temperature. If a seal pot is used, touch the two lines going to the seal gland. If circulation is taking place, one should be hotter than the other&amp;nbsp;; it is a way to know that circulation is taking place. If a pump has multiple filters on it, touching the outlet of the pump and then each filter down stream, it is possible to determine which one is in service. If a pressure relief valve is leaking through, it can be detected by touching the discharge side of the relief valve and the inlet to the relief valve. There should be a difference in the temperatures of the two lines if there is not leakage. If the temperatures are the same, it is likely that the relief valve is leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Lightly touching a piece of equipment with fingertips can give a subjective evaluation of how smooth a piece of equipment is running. With practice, it is a reasonably good method of detecting vibration. It must be done regularly as that is the only way to note the changes from yesterday or last week.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		If belts were loose, it may be possible to detect it not only by the sound but also by the smell of the rubber being removed from the side of the belts. Burned oil has a distinct scent that can indicate a potential problem. Paint that gets hot enough to discolor gives a distinctive odor. Each scent may indicate a particular problem with the equipment. Other problems can be indicated if the product being processed in the plant gives a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; odor and when there is a problem it gives a distinctly different odor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The advantages of these types of inspections are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Always available&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Inexpensive&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Can be done by anyone&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		The disadvantages to these techniques are:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Subjective&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to communicate to work request or someone else&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Difficult to repeat&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Problems cannot be detected at their earliest stages of inception&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Tools available to improve detection or quantify what your senses detect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Auditable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasonic gun: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a relatively inexpensive device for listening to noises in the ultrasonic range. It is sometimes used in leak detection and sometimes when listening to bearings.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Stethoscope:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an inexpensive tool that can pick up every sound that the equipment is making. It must be used regularly or it is impossible to determine if there is a problem or not. The good news is that it picks up everything, and the bad news is that it picks up everything.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Screwdriver: &lt;/strong&gt;A steel or aluminum rod can be used to touch the piece of equipment where the suspected noise is and the other end touched to the ear to listen for unusual noises. The end touching the ear should be padded and the other end kept away from rotating shafts.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Valve wrench:&lt;/strong&gt; A valve wrench can be used in the same way as the other techniques to get the sound of what is happening inside a piece of rotating equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Hard hat:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a hard hat can be turned on edge and touched to the equipment and the other end touched to the ear to listen for potential problems inside the rotating piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Visual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR gun:&lt;/strong&gt; The infrared handheld non-contact temperature-measuring device is an easy tool use if it is used within its limitations. The limitations are: Many IR guns use a laser pointer to tell where you are aiming the device. The area the device looks at is cone-shaped and the laser is at the center of the cone (Figure 17). That means the further away from the item of interest you are, the more surface area will be averaged into the reading. The laser spot does not represent the measurement area of the device. The first surface that the device sees is the one that will be measured. You can&amp;rsquo;t measure the temperature of something behind a glass or plastic cover, as that cover will be what is measured. If correct temperatures are important, the device must be used on flat, dark-colored objects. It will give very low readings on shiny objects. The best use of the device is to mark a black paint spot on the areas of interest and use the infrared gun, as close as possible at that spot. It is the only way to get useful repeatable readings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;IR camera: &lt;/strong&gt;These devices are similar to the handheld guns, but are like looking through a camera. The objects look gray, with a color scale range showing different temperatures. What appears to have no problem with the naked eye will show very differently with the infrared camera. Typical pictures of what the eye can see and what the infrared camera can see are illustrated in figure 18.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Strobe light&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure 19): This device has a high-intensity light that can be controlled to a specific flash rate. When an object is turning at a specific speed and the strobe flash rate is tuned to the same flash rate, the moving object appears to be stopped. A good visual inspection can be done while a piece of equipment is turning at running speed. Things like broken shim packs in couplings, missing keys or broken fans on electric motors can all be inspected without having to stop the piece of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;Tactile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;strong&gt;Vibration equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A handheld vibration meter can be used to get overall readings. The use of equipment to augment the five senses is useful because it is objective and not subjective. Everyone that uses the equipment and measures in the same place will get the same number. If 50 people touch the same piece of equipment in the same place, there is likely to be 50 different interpretations of how much vibration there is. This is also true for how hot a piece of equipment is.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			If quantitative analysis is required, a contact parameter is an inexpensive and accurate tool for temperatures. It is simple to use and will give repeatable results no matter what color the surface being measured is.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GUIDES FOR OPERATORS TO INSPECT EQUIPMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These types of inspections can be generated for all types of equipment, such as fans, compressors, extruders, turbines, motors, conveyers, elevators, etc. This list is limited to centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, gearboxes, motors, heat exchanger and turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;PUMP INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p align="center"&gt;
		&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Le-Bleu_oil.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the pump as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the pump that have come loose?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the motor amps. Pump capacity problems do not cause the motor to pull excessive amps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the seal leaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there proper level in the seal pot if used?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the discharge pressure gauge steady? (If not, there may be cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Is paint burned off in new places? Why? (Paint discolors around 400 to 450 degrees F / 200 to 230 degrees C)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at vibration levels on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the pump.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Bearings? Cavitation?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday? Is the noise the motor or the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing? (It may be a control valve opening and closing.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound like gravel inside of the pump casing? (Cavitation)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the pump?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If used, are the drive belts squealing? Are belts loose?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the pump with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it warm, hot, cold?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it shaking too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary oil pump running if it has one? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil relief valve dumping oil? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the pump vibrating? Is it the same as yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the bearing housing hot? (It may be too much oil or bad cooler.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch the seal lines; is there a difference in temperature indicating flow?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;MOTOR INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; (mechanical)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the motor as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it smoking or sparks flying?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there anything loose, shaking or vibrating on the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the flex conduit in good condition or broken?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Has the dust cap come off of the bearing on the coupling end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan on the TEFC motor turning?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the air filters or fins on a TEFC motor clear so air can circulate?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there any paint burned on the motor? If yes, why and where?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Bearings? Fan?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise the motor or the driven piece of equipment?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or a rhythmic hum?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the belts slipping on the drive end of the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;

			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it vibrating?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the fan turning and putting out air?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the cooling system for the motor and/or lubrication system functioning correctly?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;GEARBOX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the gearbox as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

			Smoking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the gearbox that have come loose? (Coolers, bearing caps, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary pump running? Why?&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the gearbox.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the gearbox?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is an oil cooler, is heat being exchanged? Touch the inlet and outlines to insure heat is being removed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;TURBINE INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the turbine as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there vibrating parts on the turbine that have come loose? (Coolers, bearing caps, etc.?)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is steam leaking out of the glands that seal the shaft to the casing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there water in the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the governor hunting (a continuous speeding up and slowing down in speed)?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the steam traps near the turbine working?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the auxiliary pump running? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the vibration readings for the turbine; are they steady and low? If not, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil level correct in the sump? In the bearing boxes?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are the ring oilers turning or hung up?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there steam leaking out of the stem of the control valve?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the air purge turned on for the bearings to keep steam out of the oil?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there coupling pieces on the pedestal under the coupling guard?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;

			Is the trip mechanism resting on its knife edge?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the delta P for the oil filter high? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check the vibration readings if continuously monitored.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at piping support springs to ensure that blocks were not left in after maintenance, especially if a hydro was performed on the piping system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the coupling area and see if there are shims from the spacer or dust if an elastometric type of coupling is used.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy? Is steam leaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing? Is the governor steady or hunting?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there steam, air or gas leaks in or near the turbine?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the turbine bearing housings with your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are they excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the oil pressure relief valve bypassing oil? If so, why?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check oil cooler to ensure it is removing heat from the oil.&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;strong&gt;HEAT EXCHANGER INSPECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;strong&gt;LOOK&lt;/strong&gt; at the heat exchanger as you walk up.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are all of the anchor bolts in place? Are they tight?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Are there any indications of leakage of fluids of any kind?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the differential pressure correct?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is heat being exchanged in the cooler? Touch the inlet and outlet and insure there is a difference in temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the delta T for the exchanger normal?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;strong&gt;LISTEN&lt;/strong&gt; to the exchanger&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it noisy?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Does it sound different today than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is the noise constant or changing?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is there the sound of gas or boiling going on inside?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		3. &lt;strong&gt;FEEL&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Touch the exchanger your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it excessively hot?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it different than it was yesterday? How and why is it different than yesterday?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Is it shaking more than yesterday? Is it too much?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Touch or test the inlets and outlets of the exchanger to see if an exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment start-up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Check and start all auxiliary system. That would include lubrication, seal, and cooling systems as they apply.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure there are adequate liquid levels in all areas that have liquids&amp;nbsp;; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers and barrier or buffer systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated prior to starting.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for warm up to allow all parts to come to temperature. A rule of thumb is to allow the pump temperature to rise at 100 degrees per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the pump uses a double seal or other arrangement that has a cooler, ensure that the cooler is functioning by touching the inlet and outlet parts to ensure that heat exchange is taking place.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there is a device such as a guided slide or flex plate as on steam turbines, it must be free to allow movement or flexing as temperatures rise from ambient. The same is true for extreme cold temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			On motors, ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that the area around the equipment is clean and free of hazards.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Ensure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that all valves are in the proper position.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Start the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform operational checks after startup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;General equipment shutdown:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		These instructions are very general and should be performed for the driver and the driven equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

		Inspection:&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If this equipment operates hot, allowances must be made for cool down to allow all parts to come to temperature and oil left circulating long enough to ensure the bearings will not be damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Look at the condition of the lubricant prior to shutdown while it is still circulating. Color changes, especially if they happen rapidly or are not normal for this piece of equipment, should be investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure that there are adequate lubricant levels in all areas that have lubricant; that includes sumps, lubricators, greasers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If there are site-specific or manufacturer-specific instructions, they must be followed.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Stop the auxiliary systems, again to include lubrication, seal systems and cooling. If rotors are extremely hot (above 250 F / 120 C), allow the lubricating system to circulate to cool the shaft and bearings. This is especially necessary if the bearings are made of babbited material.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			If the equipment has a cooler to regulate temperatures, it is ideal to have a method of back-flushing the cooler. This should be done at each opportunity such as shutdown or equipment swaps.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Ensure ventilation openings are clear of obstructions that could restrict airflow. If they are obstructed, see that they are cleared before the next use. If the motor has filters, look at the condition of the filters and have them changed if they are dirty before the next start.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			For motors, verify there are no loose conduit or cable connections or broken conduit. Insure all foundation bolts are tight.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			Perform a visual inspection for leaks after shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		While appearing elemental, the list of inspection items, explanation of equipment, and important relationships is essential to good equipment operation and longevity. It is not unusual for people to accomplish these tasks away from work but are not always practiced at work as an operator. The simple techniques of touching, listening and visually inspecting equipment while on rounds or passing by equipment will ensure the best life possible for equipment and reduce the likelihood of unexpected failures.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip: Taking voltage or resistance measurements</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When taking voltage or resistance measurements, it is important to take into consideration the connection point of your test equipment. Voltage readings will indicate power circuit anomalies upstream of where the voltage test leads are connected. Any power circuit anomaly occurring downstream of the voltage test leads toward the motor will not be seen. The opposite is true for the resistance measurements. Power circuit anomalies occurring downstream of the resistance test lead connections will be identified by a resistance imbalance. However, all power circuit anomalies that exist upstream of the resistance test leads towards the power supply or transformer will not be seen. Knowing this warrants both a voltage and a resistance measurement when trying to troubleshoot or determine the health of your power circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Benton Foundry reduces its energy costs and emissions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nestled in the Pennsylvania woods between a state park and a fish hatchery, Benton Foundry and its owners have long been committed to reducing the site&amp;rsquo;s impact on the environment. Recognized as a leader in its industry, its foundry has no steam plume, no smokestack and no discharge of process water. Now, after completing a five-year plan of work, it also can boast about reducing dust emissions while dramatically cutting energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For nearly 100 years, spanning three generations, the family-owned foundry has produced gray iron and ductile iron parts. Today, with a diversified base, the foundry serves more than 400 customers with 8,000 active part numbers. However, creating these products consumes a great deal of electricity, and with energy costs rising, foundry owners began an aggressive plan to cut usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	They first targeted the foundry&amp;rsquo;s four furnaces, the largest consumer of electricity in the facility. However, after implementing an energy management strategy and installing specialized software to help prioritize power demand, their attention turned to motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/baldor010.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. New dust collectors installed at the Benton Foundry are powered by Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E motors. The return air moves through HEPA filters and heats the facility in the winter months and directs the warm air outside during the summer. The project has resulted in a six-figure reduction in heating costs, while markedly improving comfort in the foundry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The manufacturing vice president for Benton Foundry, Jeff Hall, says that because electric motors were consuming a sizable portion of electricity, the site began a search for the most energy-efficient motor it could find. At this same time, it also was starting a five-year program of installing dust collectors and wanted to standardize one motor for their entire facility. The motor Benton Foundry chose to specify was the Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This motor is not the lowest price product available, but it offers so many additional benefits that make it worth the premium,&amp;rdquo; says Hall. &amp;ldquo;The Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E offers the highest efficiency ratings vs. others in the marketplace. So when you take a look at the cents per kilowatt and the hours that these motors run, with the improved efficiencies of the Baldor product, the payback can be in as little as 18 months. When you consider how many years these motors will last, choosing the Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E makes the most sense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first dust collector was installed in 2007. The system, powered by a 500-horsepower Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E, moves air at a rate of 120,000 cubic feet per minute. The return air moves through HEPA filters and heats the facility in the winter months and directs the warm air outside during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This project has resulted in a six-figure reduction in heating costs, while markedly improving comfort in the foundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/baldor011.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. An existing dust collector was retrofitted with a cyclone, powered by a 200 HP Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E. This unit removes larger particulate and metallic pieces, reducing emissions by 50 percent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A second dust collector, powered by a 200 HP Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E motor, came on-line in 2009. This unit is for furnaces, pre-heaters and sand system. An existing third collector was designated for the grinding and cleaning operations. This unit was retrofitted with a cyclone, powered by a 200 HP Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E, designed to remove larger particulate and metallic pieces. The emissions from this collector were reduced by 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, more than 100 Super-E motors can be found throughout the Benton Foundry. Hall says they plan to add others as older motors fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Benton Foundry looked at a variety of motors from a number of manufacturers, Hall says they chose the Super-E because of the merits of the motor and because Baldor brought more to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/baldor012.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. By looking at the cents per kilowatt and hours that motors run in the foundry, officials say the improved efficiencies of the Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E will deliver a payback in as little as 18 months. Today, more than 100 Baldor&amp;bull;Reliance Super-E motors are operating at the foundry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We looked beyond the purchase price and focused on the return on our investment,&amp;rdquo; says Hall. &amp;ldquo;One has only to look at the total operating lifetime costs of the motor to realize that the cheaper motor can be the more expensive motor. Quality and performance are not a given.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Troubleshooting power problems on HVAC equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A variable frequency drive (VFD) fails to vary the discharge-air fan speed. A motor overheats and fails prematurely. Programmable controls that generally operate without issue suddenly experience problems when operating on standby power. A VFD trips for no apparent reason in a chilled water system resulting in a high-temperature alarm. A circuit breaker trips, leading to a system shutdown; yet, a clamp meter reading reveals no abnormal current flow in the system after restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While each troubleshooting problem in an HVAC system presents its own unique set of circumstances, maintenance professionals may recognize such problems as possible power quality issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking the real cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Electronics are the foundation of modern control systems. Programmable controls, solid state relays, sensors, transducers, variable frequency drives on fans and chilled water pumps, and electronic controls on actuators all are susceptible to problems that older, purely electromechanical controls did not have. These problems are often the result of the quality of the voltage and current being supplied to the HVAC equipment. Poor &amp;ldquo;power quality&amp;rdquo; is electric power that does not meet specified parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As with all forms of HVAC troubleshooting, technicians must understand the sources of potential problems in order to solve them. Unexplained problems are often attributed to faulty electronic equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, the real cause may not lie in the electronic equipment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False or deceptive clues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For example, a VFD that fails to properly vary discharge &amp;ndash; air fan speed can be the result of various system issues &amp;ndash; from a DDC override initiated on the VFD, to a faulty static pressure sensor, to excessive duct leakage. While the cause of the initial failure rarely lies with the VFD itself, the VFD may in fact be causing other system problems. Motors overheat, nuisance trips of circuit breakers or unexplained blown fuses happen, and spurious alarms can occur elsewhere in the digital control system. Since these can all be characteristics of normal VFD operation, the technicians must always trace the problem back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In one instance, a fan-supplied VFD would inadvertently trip in a chiller system when power was transferred from the usual source to the standby source. The result was high-temperature alarms on the supplied equipment because of inadequate cooling. VFDs are designed to ride-through a certain amount of voltage interruption in a system. However, if VFD specifications for such faults are exceeded, the VFD will shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this case, the electronic drive was first thought to be at fault. However, investigation into the VFD operating parameters and the logging of voltage and current values during transfers of system power revealed the true cause of the problem: Transfer switch time was often too long to support VFD operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another case, a VFD in a VAV terminal would trip offline when supplied power from the standby power source. The problem was found to be the inability of the standby generator to provide sufficient power quality to operate the VFD. Voltage fluctuations when on standby power resulted in trips on the VFD. The solution was to place the VFD into bypass operation when on standby power, thus bypassing the electronic variable speed controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The root of power quality problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Electronic equipment operates by taking in alternating current and converting it to direct current for use by electronic components. This process creates harmonic currents that flow back into the system. These harmonic currents can cause overheating and also distort the sine waves upstream of the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harmonic currents are currents that appear at multiples of the fundamental 60-hertz (Hz) frequency. For example, the third harmonic is current that flows at 180 Hz (60 x 3); the fifth harmonic is current that flows at 300 Hz (60 x 5), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How to measure harmonics&lt;br /&gt;
	Technicians measure the levels of the various harmonics and the amount of distortion created to determine if the harmonics are creating problems. Use a power quality analyzer to measure harmonic levels and distortion. The key measurement is Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Set the analyzer according to instructions and read THD directly on the meter face. THD should not exceed 5 percent when measured at the point where the feeder that supplies the VFD is also supplying other loads. This is the point of common coupling (PCC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If THD of voltage exceeds limitations, then consult with the VFD manufacturer to determine the best solution. This may include the installation of a line reactor or isolation transformer. Learning to use a power quality analyzer is not difficult, and such efforts typically far outweigh the cost of HVAC system downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke12.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another power quality issue experienced in HVAC systems is motor failure, especially those supplied by VFDs. This failure rate may increase if the motor tends to run at the slower speeds typical of many applications. Failures often include overheating, insulation breakdown or premature bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All such failures can be attributed to normal operating characteristics of VFDs. The electronic drive varies the voltage and frequency to the motor, to vary its speed. Unfortunately, harmonic currents are also supplied to the motor, which can result in overheating. This &amp;ldquo;pulse width modulated&amp;rdquo; voltage and current supplied to the motor also can damage insulation, resulting in premature breakdown and motor failure. Currents also can flow through motor bearings, greatly shortening their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best solution to all these problems is to use inverter-duty-rated motors specially designed for use on variable frequency drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voltage unbalance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Three-phase motors that are not supplied by a VFD may also fail due to another power quality problem: voltage unbalance. A phase voltage that is out of balance by as little as 1 percent can result in a six-to-10 times greater motor current unbalance. Such excessive amounts of current flow can quickly result in overheated motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To determine unbalance, measure the voltage from phase-to-phase for each of the phases, A-B, A-C, and B-C. Total the three readings and divide by three. This is the average phase-to-phase voltage. If any of the three individual readings varies by more than 1 percent from the average, you have a voltage unbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At 5 percent voltage unbalance, the motor typically overheats and is destroyed. Generally, the problem is too many single-phase loads being supplied by one individual phase. These loads must be evenly distributed among phases at the panelboard to correct the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke13.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	All HVAC electrical and electronic equipment has specified electrical supply parameters. Failure to meet them will simply ensure the equipment will not operate as planned. A fan-powered VAV terminal is a typical example of equipment with specified electrical supply requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When experiencing erratic operation of this equipment, verify the electrical supply parameters are being met. For such equipment, AC input voltage must fall within 10 percent of rated voltage at rated frequency. The nameplate will show the equipment&amp;rsquo;s rated voltage. For example, equipment rated at 208 volts must have a supply voltage that falls between 187 V and 229 V. It is not uncommon to find low voltages when troubleshooting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s also important to use a true-rms meter when measuring voltage and current values. Today&amp;rsquo;s modern HVAC systems not only produce harmonic currents, they may also operate improperly due to the sine wave distortions created by such harmonics. An average responding meter, used by many HVAC technicians, will not give accurate readings if harmonics are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Average responding meters read current and voltage of sinusoidal waveforms at 60 Hz with no harmonics present. Non-linear loads, such as VFDs, produce non-sinusoidal waveforms and currents and voltages at various frequencies. You must use the right meter to read the values in these supply circuits. Only true-rms meters will give you the correct readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply voltage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If supply voltage is below the low voltage specification, you can expect two problems with HVAC equipment. First, motor life will be shortened as motors draw excess current to produce the needed horsepower at the lower voltage. Second, electronics will not function properly as the power supply portion of the electronic controls will not have sufficient voltage to charge the capacitors in their filtering circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electronic components, which typically operate at only 5 volts DC, will now be greatly affected by a low incoming voltage. Expect erratic operation and spurious alarms, depending on the severity of the low incoming voltage. And remember, without the true-rms meter, you may not have an accurate picture of the actual supply voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AC power also is required to be within 5 percent of rated frequency at the rated voltage on a typical VAV terminal. Generally, this is not a problem when operating on utility power. However, HVAC pros report numerous problems with both voltage and frequency when operating on standby generators. Be sure to verify all incoming electrical supply specifications for all power sources required for the HVAC system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An additional equipment manufacturer requirement is that the supply &amp;ldquo;must meet a combined variation in the voltage and frequency of 10 percent (the sum of absolute values) of rated values, provided the frequency variation does not exceed 5 percent of rated frequency.&amp;rdquo; Once again, the equipment is most likely to exhibit this problem when operating on standby power. Several options are available to stabilize control problems when operating on standby power. While this requires working with the appropriate system engineers and technicians, the first step is to ensure you have accurate readings to back up your claim that the control problem rests with unstable standby power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many HVAC troubleshooting problems will continue to be solved by such routine tasks as checking fuses, testing for the presence of voltage at a contactor, and verifying current flow does not exceed the motor nameplate data. However, systems that contain electronic controls and VFDs will have problems due to power quality issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, many HVAC professionals are expanding their skills and knowledge into this area. The more controls are used in HVAC and building systems, the more power quality problems will arise. The use of true-rms meters and analyzers that log electrical parameters over time will greatly enhance isolating and correcting poor power quality issues. Proper knowledge, coupled with the right tools, goes a long way in helping maintenance professionals resolve many problems associated with today&amp;rsquo;s HVAC systems.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Free DOE software supports motor and motor systems planning</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	MotorMaster+ is a free online software tool developed by the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) to support motor and motor systems planning by identifying the most efficient action for a given repair or motor purchase decision. It accomplishes this by providing a motor comparison feature that allows users to choose between repairing, rewinding, or replacing motor equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This tool quickly identifies inefficient or oversized facility motors and computes the savings that can be achieved by replacing older, standard efficiency motors with National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency motors.

            <title>Motion control solution raises reliability, integrity of food production</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Decades ago, stainless steel was considered a high-end option for food packaging equipment. But in recent years, sanitary washdown requirements in the global food processing and packaging industry have tightened. As a result, industry associations have established standards and directives to help manufacturers and their machine builders adhere to these tougher requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For example, one of the American Meat Institute&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;10 Principles of Sanitary Design&amp;rdquo; requires machine builders to design equipment with &amp;ldquo;compatible materials,&amp;rdquo; meaning those that will stand up over time to high-pressure washdown cycles.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There is no question that stainless steel is the best material for withstanding caustic chemicals and high water pressure, making it a crucial element to food packaging machinery. Machine builders that incorporate stainless steel into machine designs will be able to better serve manufacturers that regard food safety and sanitary design with paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rockwell011.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. FR Drake is the worldwide leader for automatic food-loading machinery in the frankfurter industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With 90 percent of the worldwide market share, FR Drake is a clear leader for automatic food-loading machinery in the frankfurter industry. The Waynesboro, Va., company builds loading equipment that prepares individual frankfurters for packaging by lining them up in rows just before they enter a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) machine. Manufacturers look to FR Drake to help automate manual, hand-loading packaging processes with equipment that can help boost production reliability and integrity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	FR Drake engineers have always been proactive about meeting their customers&amp;rsquo; needs, including the need for sanitary machines that can tolerate rigorous and frequent machine washdowns. Since standard servo motors cannot withstand high-pressure, caustic washdown processes, FR Drake engineers historically addressed the situation by building stainless-steel covers in an effort to protect the motors.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unfortunately, food particles often would catch and collect on seams and rivets surrounding the housing. Also, washdown fluids would eventually work their way into the housing and make contact with the motor. Finally, the caustic chemicals would damage the point where cables connect to the motors, and potentially corrode the housing itself.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Even with a stainless-steel housing, standard servo motors typically last only five to seven years in a rigorous washdown application. Because each FR Drake frankfurter loader uses four servo motors, end-users of the machinery could potentially find themselves replacing a motor once every two years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The stainless-steel covers we were building helped increase the longevity of the servo motors, but not to the extent that we wanted for our customers,&amp;rdquo; said George Reed, vice president of engineering for FR Drake. &amp;ldquo;We identified a few characteristics of the motor housing that, if remedied, could further improve the reliability of our machinery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Since a typical FR Drake frankfurter loading machine is in the field for many years, Reed and his team decided to find a motor solution that could withstand the life cycle of the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/rockwell012.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Pictured here, stainless-steel servo motors help improve machine cleanliness and performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	FR Drake turned to its longtime automation solutions provider, Rockwell Automation, for a new option. A few years ago, FR Drake engineers attended the Automation Fair event hosted by Rockwell Automation to discuss the problem their food-manufacturing customers faced and the type of motor solution they were seeking. Based on input from FR Drake and other machine builders, Rockwell Automation brought the Allen-Bradley MP-Series stainless-steel servo motor to market to help manufacturers in the food industry improve hygienic machine design.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The motors feature a smooth, round design that is ideal for cleaning because it provides a surface area where meat and liquids cannot easily collect. The motor is comprised of 300-grade stainless steel, which goes through special processing after component fabrication to remove impurities and promote greater corrosion protection. Additionally, the motors have factory-sealed cable exits that help maximize product reliability.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just like standard servo motors from Rockwell Automation, the MP-Series stainless-steel motors are part of the company&amp;rsquo;s Allen-Bradley Kinetix Integrated Motion portfolio. As the motion control component of the Rockwell Automation Integrated Architecture system, Kinetix features the seamless integration of Logix controllers, servo drives, servo motors and actuators.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Updating our machinery with the MP-Series stainless-steel motor was a very simple and straightforward retrofit,&amp;rdquo; said Reed. &amp;ldquo;Since we already were standardized on the Integrated Architecture system, and because these motors come in the same form factor, torque and programming language as other Allen-Bradley servo motors, it was a virtual drop-in replacement for the motors we were using.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	FR Drake&amp;rsquo;s machinery architecture also includes an Allen-Bradley ControlLogix programmable automation controller (PAC), an Allen-Bradley industrial computer, and FactoryTalk View Machine Edition human-machine interface software that all work together to provide improved machine performance information.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Helping to round out the integrity of the machine &amp;ndash; particularly for international markets where CE-certified equipment is mandated by law &amp;ndash; FR Drake incorporated advanced safety controls from Rockwell Automation. Engineers implemented Allen-Bradley SensaGuard Safety Sensors and Allen-Bradley Guardmaster safety relays to help operators more safely access areas of the machine where there is motion.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The MP-Series stainless-steel motors allowed FR Drake to eliminate the design time and costs required for building the extra protective housing unit.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Subsequently, the improved reliability of FR Drake&amp;rsquo;s loading equipment has reduced the number of warranty requests the company receives, and has reduced the amount of motor maintenance the company must provide for customers. In fact, in the first two years of using the MP-Series stainless-steel motors, FR Drake personnel have not been called for a single field service issue, and the company is currently working toward making the motors standard on all of its loader machinery.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Finally, because of the CE certification of Rockwell Automation safety controls, and because manufacturers around the world have a high level of familiarity with the Logix Control Platform and Integrated Architecture system, FR Drake can continue building business in international markets, which comprise 75 percent of the company&amp;rsquo;s business.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The results mentioned above are specific to FR Drake&amp;rsquo;s use of Rockwell Automation products and services in conjunction with other products. Specific results may vary for other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Turbine upgrades improve production at Kauai Coffee hydroelectric plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Located on the north shore of Kauai in Hawaii, the Wainiha power plant&amp;rsquo;s two 1906-era Pelton hydroelectric turbines have been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The 4-megawatt plant supplies Kauai Coffee Company&amp;rsquo;s power operating needs, while also providing 6 percent of the island&amp;rsquo;s total power generation. Keeping the more than 100-year old fly-ball governors running efficiently and correctly became increasingly difficult in recent years, with malfunctions resulting in costly repairs and downtime. Legacy controls on the dual needle impulse turbines created an imbalance on needle position that resulted in lost efficiency, continuous vibration, and wear. Kauai Coffee Company needed an upgrade solution that could update the governors to a modern digital control and support the continued life and maintainability of this important company asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Energy&amp;rsquo;s Control Solutions business upgraded the legacy mechanical control to a state-of-the-art Mark VIe digital control with a modern Hydraulic Pressure Unit. Upgrading the legacy control to an electrical interface was accomplished by adding an electro hydraulic interface proportional valve. The team also replaced the original servos with new high-pressure cylinders, provided a closed-loop Hydraulic Pressure Unit oil system, and added feedback sensors for needle and deflector position. The new system completely automates all of the plant functions and allows for touch screen operator interface, automatic online synchronization, and remote monitoring of all associated field devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Mark VIe is more dependable, easier to maintain, and more efficient, allowing hundreds of thousands of additional kilowatt-hours of electricity to be generated each year. Combined with reduced start-up time, overall power production at the plant increased by five to ten percent. Excess power is sold to the local utility on Kauai and is an important source of revenue for the company. The Wainiha plant staff also benefits from the ability to remotely monitor and easily troubleshoot the new system, contributing to plant productivity, maintainability, and ease of operator training. The new remote monitoring capabilities decrease the number of 90-minute trips from the main office to the plant needed for maintenance, and allow staff to quickly identify problems before traveling to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dan Sargent, Kauai Coffee Company project manager, observed, &amp;ldquo;The new digital control system and its simple-to-use ToolboxST software tools are more accurate and dependable, easier to maintain, and &amp;ndash; best of all &amp;ndash; more efficient, allowing additional kilowatt hours of electricity to be generated each year. The system and software ushers in a new era of power generation for this valuable company asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Benefits of the Mark VIe digital control with a modern Hydraulic Pressure Unit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Reduced incidences of costly repairs and downtime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Increased power production at times of lower water levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Decreased start-up time from four hours to less than 10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Modern maintenance tools and diagnostics allowing troubleshooting in real-time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;bull; Increased plant automation and remote monitoring capability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/4bK0zkx3I9k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Don't forget to take notes when testing your electric motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When performing tests on your electric motors, you might be tempted for the sake of time to wait until later to write down comments associated with the condition of the asset or surrounding environment. &amp;nbsp;Although we all think we have a memory like a steel trap, the reality is that this vital information, critical to performing a proper analysis of the data, will be forgotten in whole or at least in part by the majority of us after we have tested more motors in the same day or week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, for those using the MCEGold software, the last diagnostic note entered in the Message Center for an asset can be automatically pulled into the Detailed Report templates to save time in the report writing effort. For more detail on the MCEGold software, visit &lt;a href="http://www.pdma.com/PdMA-MCEGold.php"&gt;www.pdma.com/PdMA-MCEGold.php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Vibration tester keeps the good stuff flowing at Alpenrose Dairy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	At Alpenrose Dairy in Portland, Ore., operators process the raw milk into a dozen varieties of milk, six cultured products (cottage cheese and sour cream) and 31 flavors of ice cream. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to keep the complex Alpenrose production facility, with its hundreds of motors, pumps and gearboxes, running butter-smooth. But thanks to the new Fluke 810 Vibration Tester, it&amp;rsquo;s easier today to maintain Alpenrose as the cream of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This isn&amp;rsquo;t your average dairy. Family owned and operated since 1916, Alpenrose Dairy Inc. has evolved over time into a community entertainment center that includes Alpenrose Stadium, Dairyville, a replica of a western frontier town, a 600-seat opera house, a Quarter Midget racing arena and an Olympic-style bicycle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The hub of this high-profile enterprise is the production plant, churning out dairy products that get to market the day they left the farm. Maintenance manager Eric Trummel and maintenance technician and electric motor expert Todd Toburen keep their fingers on the pulse of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/fluke21.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the U.S. Navy, Toburen learned vibration analysis to find and diagnose electric motor problems. &amp;ldquo;We would take our readings and send the data to Annapolis. Annapolis would compile tons of data bouncing off of different frequencies and give us a call back to tell us whether it was good or bad,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;We would rewind and rebuild the motor and retest it, just to make sure what we sent out to the fleet was a good piece of equipment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pumps, motors, gearboxes and more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In his five years at Alpenrose, Toburen has taken charge of the hundreds of pumps, motors, gearboxes, compressors and other equipment required to operate a midsize dairy plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got equipment here that if it goes down, processing stops,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If the bad part is a high-dollar item, we don&amp;rsquo;t have sitting on the shelf. We could be down for a couple of days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the dairy business, where fresh products are essential, such an outage is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To prevent such incidents, Alpenrose manages a more proactive maintenance program to help understand when a motor or machine may encounter problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our biggest concerns are the pieces of equipment that are critical to the processes,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If we see that there&amp;rsquo;s deterioration in the bearings or what have you, we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to schedule the downtime to take care of that problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But accuracy is key. Trummel recalls an incident when a vibration analysis contractor doing a semiannual check warned of bearing deterioration in an important air compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;He claimed that one of the bearings had gone bad, and that we needed to take care of it in the next couple of months,&amp;rdquo; Trummel said. &amp;ldquo;The next week, the coupling on the compressor disintegrated. The air compressor went down, and it represented a limitation of the plant. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized these guys may not know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing. This is why this Fluke 810 is relevant to us. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have this capability in-house and check this equipment every couple of weeks. We get a better idea and a better feel for what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The handheld Fluke 810 is designed for maintenance professionals who need to troubleshoot mechanical problems and quickly understand the root cause of equipment condition. It&amp;rsquo;s programmed to diagnose the most common mechanical problems of unbalance, looseness, misalignment and bearing failures in a wide variety of mechanical equipment, including motors, fans, gearboxes, couplings, pumps, compressors and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The diagnostic technology in the Fluke 810 analyzes machinery condition and identifies faults by comparing vibration data to an extensive set of rules and algorithms developed over years of field experience. The Fluke 810 is not merely a vibration detector, but a complete diagnostic and problem-solving solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Using the Fluke, we&amp;rsquo;re able to take a reading once a week or once a month&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;If we notice something different, we can build a trend analysis with that data. If we notice there&amp;rsquo;s a change in our frequencies, that&amp;rsquo;s something we need to look at. Of course, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able every single month to do every piece of equipment here at the dairy. We&amp;rsquo;ll prioritize what equipment we want to check on a monthly or a quarterly basis, and I&amp;rsquo;m basing that on what my baseline reading is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;The diagnosis was right on&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Machine operators form an important early warning system. If a machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel or sound right to them, Toburen troubleshoots the equipment with the Fluke 810 to see exactly what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The nice thing with this is you&amp;rsquo;re able to tell, &amp;lsquo;Is it the gearbox? Is it the compressor? Is it the motor? Is it the drive end? Is it the off end?&amp;rsquo; It even breaks it down to if you have a loose coupling or not,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Fluke 810 also rates the level of severity of any problems it finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It has four different levels,&amp;rdquo; Toburen said. &amp;ldquo;Green being slight, yellow being moderate, orange being serious and red being extreme.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But Toburen said it took some checking to fully trust the opinions of the Fluke 810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I had to develop a comfort level with the Fluke&amp;rsquo;s interpretation,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a bit of that. Somebody would come up and say they had a real loud motor. I&amp;rsquo;d go out and take a vibration analysis on it, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done that it&amp;rsquo;s come back as &amp;lsquo;extreme.&amp;rsquo; The Fluke will actually give you &amp;lsquo;loose bearing&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;bearing wear&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; it will give you the diagnosis. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the motors apart, and each time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it, the diagnosis was right on. Then I&amp;rsquo;d also rebuild the motor, throw it on the workbench, put the 810 back on it and it comes back as either &amp;lsquo;no problem detected&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;slight wear or vibration.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Has the Fluke 810 saved money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; said Toburen. &amp;ldquo;But being able to say there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with our equipment, troubleshoot that, get the parts on order, repair it in our downtime and bring it back up online &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s almost priceless. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that part on the shelf it could be two days out, and you&amp;rsquo;re not doing any processing. The amount you can save? It could be significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Electric motor tip covers negative temperature coefficient</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Your motor insulation has a negative temperature coefficient. This means that as the motor temperature rises, like in normal operations, the insulation resistance to current flow reduces. If insulation temperature goes down, like after a shutdown, the resistance goes up. This change can be dramatic. For every 10-degree Celsius rise in temperature, the resistance is cut in half. For every 10-degree drop in temperature, the resistance is doubled. Be careful that you are not trying to trend insulation resistance without performing a temperature correction of the readings. Performing a polarization index test during a significant temperature change will provide additional data for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Choice in motors saves Weyerhaeuser energy dollars</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When Weyerhaeuser, a $20 billion international forest products company, began its search for an energy-efficient motor, it faced the same issues and opportunities as other manufacturers; the rising cost of power, and the desire to take advantage of energy rebates. But what makes Weyerhaeuser different is the way in which it approached the motor selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With approximately 50,000 motors in operation, accounting for 81 percent of the company&amp;rsquo;s electrical load, it was clear that Weyerhaeuser wanted the most efficient motor available. But it also wanted a product with superior quality and reliability that would help it reduce unplanned downtime and cut maintenance costs. Deciding not to focus on the purchase price alone, the company determined that a strictly scientific approach would help it reach its ultimate goal of reducing total cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Weyerhaeuser selected a cross-functional team for the project and named John Holmquist, a Weyerhaeuser senior scientist and Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, as one the team&amp;rsquo;s leaders. Holmquist and the technology team quickly decided that the IEEE 841 standard, which is recognized as a tough design and manufacturing standard for improved reliability, efficiency and performance, would become the new baseline for Weyerhaeuser motor requirements. Next, the team asked six motor manufacturers to provide samples for evaluation. Each motor was extensively tested, torn down for inspection, and then rated on more than 170 performance attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/baldor101.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on overall quality, efficiency and availability, the team selected the Reliance 841 XL Premium Efficient motor. It reported that the product met or exceeded all IEEE specifications, and that because it was a standard Reliance offering, the motor would be readily available from Reliance stock centers throughout the U.S. and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to partner with Reliance and standardize on a motor that is applicable to all parts of the Weyerhaeuser industry &amp;ndash; from forest, to wood, to pulp and paper,&amp;rdquo; said Holmquist. &amp;ldquo;The Reliance 841 XL is designed for severe-duty applications and meets all of our requirements for quality, reliability and energy efficiency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were several features of the Reliance motor with which Holmquist was particularly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Reliance really has a precision-balanced rotor providing smoother operation, reduced vibration and longer bearing life,&amp;rdquo; said Holmquist. &amp;ldquo;Additionally, using Conrad bearings with bearing isolators on each end will extend the life of the motors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on payback calculations developed by the team, the Reliance 841 XL would be used in all new applications. Calling older standard motors &amp;ldquo;economically obsolete&amp;rdquo;, Holmquist told his colleagues that &amp;ldquo;it pays us to buy the new energy-efficient motor.&amp;rdquo; But the team still needed to determine what made the best economic sense when it came to the issue of failed motors and retrofitting existing motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team calculated both the short- and long-term cost of repair and compared those numbers with the cost and long-term benefits of installing the new energy-efficient motor. The numbers indicated that all failed motors, 50 horsepower and lower, should be replaced with the Reliance product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We determined that it&amp;rsquo;s a more cost-effective solution to scrap the failed motor and replace it with the Reliance 841 XL,&amp;rdquo; said Holmquist. &amp;ldquo;We also recommended that motors 60 horsepower and higher should be evaluated on an individual basis to determine the most cost-effective solution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And while it may seem difficult to replace a motor that&amp;rsquo;s running, the team discovered that in many cases replacing these inefficient motors actually makes good financial sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our recommendation is that all motors that can meet a payback period of less than 3.5 years should be retrofitted,&amp;rdquo; Holmquist reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Theoretically, the technology team&amp;rsquo;s choice of motor and its recommendations on the motor&amp;rsquo;s usage added up to reduced operating costs. But would those numbers add up the same way on the mill floor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORPAC Puts Motors to the Test&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Among the Weyerhaeuser mills that enthusiastically embraced the decision to standardize on the Reliance 841 XL was the North American Paper Corporation (NORPAC). The NORPAC facility, located in Longview, Wash., is a joint venture between Weyerhaeuser and Nippon Paper Industries of Japan. The mill, the second largest of its kind in North America, operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, producing more than 750,000 tons of high-quality newsprint annually &amp;ndash; enough to stretch to the moon and back every two weeks. NORPAC serves newspaper publishers and commercial printers in the western United States and Japan. Major newspaper groups served in the U.S. include: Gannett, Knight-Ridder, Dow Jones, San Francisco Newspaper Agency, the Oregonian and the Seattle Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mill leadership readily understood how dramatically the rising cost of energy impacted their operation. Since they couldn&amp;rsquo;t control the price of electricity, they were willing to do all they could to reduce the energy that NORPAC used. In order to capture the maximum energy savings as soon as possible, plus take advantage of incentives being offered by the local utility, NORPAC began by changing out larger motors first before moving to smaller units. By fall, NORPAC had retrofitted more than 200 older-model motors with the Reliance 841 XL, reducing energy costs significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, Mark Higginson, senior support engineer for NORPAC&amp;rsquo;s electrical and control systems, continues to emphasize the energy-efficiency program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been fun to jump on the bandwagon and keep it moving,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;Our systematic approach to identify inefficient equipment and change it out during planned shutdowns continues.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an average monthly power bill of approximately $4 million, Higginson believes that every opportunity to change out an old motor and replace it with a Reliance 841 XL means continued incremental improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Reducing the bill by several percentage points makes a big difference,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It also offers a dramatic return on our investment because when you couple the efficiency savings of this motor along with the energy rebates offered by our local utility, the payback for the motor is less than one year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the end, the numbers on paper added up the same way on NORPAC&amp;rsquo;s mill floor. The scientific approach, the calculations developed and the recommendations made were right. Because of the work done by Holmquist and his technology team, NORPAC has cut energy and maintenance costs, reduced downtime and lowered its total cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Culligan uses H2 inverter to improve its bottling operation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Culligan name has become internationally famous. &amp;ldquo;Hey Culligan Man!&amp;rdquo; became a well-known phrase and the Culligan Water Treatment System has become a world leader. Culligan does more for business than provide softeners and treatment products. They&amp;rsquo;re also a leading distributor of bottled water and filtered drinking water systems for commercial and industrial use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culligan, located in Tulsa, Okla., is making good use of an H2 inverter from Baldor Electric Company. In this facility, Culligan bottles eight-ounce to five-gallon bottled water used by its commercial and industrial customers. A separate operation of this plant is the deionization/regeneration facility. In this area, backwash funnels are used and must hold a desired pressure. By using the PID function of the drive, the line operator never has to worry about having too much or too little water pressure. More importantly, the Baldor drive is able to deliver a steady water flow and pressure rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Culligan001.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Culligan&amp;rsquo;s vice president of operations, Chip Pearce, stated, &amp;ldquo;Before this new setup, we had to walk 300 feet back and forth to stop and start our motor, and the pressure in the pipe was only a &amp;lsquo;good guess&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see the automation of this part of our operation. I know the operator simply loves it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the line operator shuts off all of the water valves, nothing is seen on his end. But 300 feet down line, the Baldor drive is seeing the demand drop to zero and knows to stop the motor and pump. Seeing no demand, the drive goes into a &amp;ldquo;sleep&amp;rdquo; mode. Later, when the operator opens the valve again and drops the pressure below the set point, the drive wakes back up and gives a command to the motor and pump to repressurize the pipe. This occurs in a seamless transition, allowing the operator to fill from one to 32 containers consistently and reliably, resulting in more productivity at the fill area and better service to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Duncan Industrial Solutions, suppliers of the pumping equipment, installed the drive, set all of the parameters and immediately could control the &amp;ldquo;stop and start&amp;rdquo; of the motor and pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Gates launches power transmission case studies library</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Power Transmission unit of Gates Corporation, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading manufacturers of belt drive systems, has launched a &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gates.com%2Fptcasestudies%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpr_optimization%26utm_medium%3Dpress_release%26utm_campaign%3Dcase_studies&amp;amp;esheet=6247636&amp;amp;lan=en_US&amp;amp;anchor=case+studies+library&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=5f9158df2924ce65ffff72a6925ad6ac" target="_blank"&gt;case studies library&lt;/a&gt;as a resource for facility and plant managers who want to reduce costs or increase efficiency via their power transmission systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The success stories, called Gates Powered Conversions, demonstrate how Gates belt drive systems have helped industry-leading customers improve system reliability, reduce downtime, minimize maintenance and find energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Users select from a growing catalogue of more than 80 case studies organized by industry, such as chemical processing, food and beverage, oilfield, aggregate and mining and paper processing or by facilities, such as hospitals; by product, including the Poly Chain GT Carbon, PowerGrip GT2 and Predator belt drive systems; and by application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In one case study, Predator belts on blowers are conservatively estimated to save a raw material processing plant $500,000 annually in maintenance and downtime costs. In another, Poly Chain GT Carbon belt drive systems allowed a paperboard plant to shift the responsibilities of its maintenance staff and capitalize on time saved, as the need for thousands of hours of lubricating roller chain drives was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How to troubleshoot wound rotor motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Wound rotor motors sound complex, but fundamentally are the same as your standard AC Induction motor. The rotor receives its power from an induction process and uses some form of variable external resistance to adjust startup current and speed. The advantage to troubleshooting the wound rotor motor is that you can isolate the three basic components from each other to quickly isolate the root cause of any electrical anomaly. The three basic components are the stator, rotor and resistor bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The relationship between the stator and rotor in a wound rotor motor is very much like a primary to secondary relationship in a transformer. Any variation in the secondary or rotor circuit, which includes the resistor bank, will be evident on the primary or stator. The opposite is true as well in that anomalies on the primary or stator will be reflected on the secondary or rotor circuit. Knowing this make sure you don&amp;#39;t jump to a conclusion that the stator windings are defective when a high inductive imbalance is identified on the stator windings. Carbon tracking between slip rings, malfunctioning contacts or failed resistors in the resistor bank can be the root cause of the high inductive imbalance measured on the stator windings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Plum Creek Timber chooses Reliance motors for high-end MDF plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Located in the small town of Columbia Falls, Mont., not too far from Glacier National Park, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the largest fiber board plant in North America, the third largest in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s owned by Plum Creek Timber Company Inc., the second-largest private timberland owner in the United States. Plum Creek products include furniture-quality veneer logs, proprietary plywood and specialty lumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For years, Plum Creek has held a leadership position in the medium dense fiber board, or MDF, business. But back in 1999, they decided to expand their capabilities to produce an enhanced product line. In January 2000, they broke ground and began constructing a new state-of-the-art facility to produce Super-Refined MDF-2, a proprietary engineered wood panel prized by woodworkers for its smooth unblemished surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Their $69 million investment would represent a quantum leap in fiber refining technology, and they selected Reliance as their key motor supplier. Why? With a long history of using Reliance motors, Plum Creek engineers knew they could count on a product that would provide superior performance and reliability. But more importantly, they understood the company would continue to act as their trusted partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choosing a Trusted Partner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Plum Creek project engineer Jack Hinman faced a tremendous challenge when he was asked to head up a five-person team to build the new plant and get it operational in less than a year. To accomplish the goal they looked for manufacturers that would act as their partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It was a very fast track and we had only a limited number of people to work on the project; that&amp;rsquo;s why we turned to the product and the people we had experience with,&amp;rdquo; stated Hinman. &amp;ldquo;We rely on the company for a lot of support. This Columbia Falls facility has used Reliance motors since 1974, we know the product well, we&amp;rsquo;ve had good luck with the motors, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we specified them in the new line.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team worked closely with their European OEM&amp;rsquo;s to make sure they understood why Reliance motors needed to be included on the equipment that would be installed in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our past successful experience using Reliance motors prompted us to specify Reliance as much as we could,&amp;rdquo; stated Hinman. &amp;ldquo;We told our OEM&amp;rsquo;s overseas that we wanted equipment we could replace here, and we wanted something that we had good experience with&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliance Provides Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The center piece of the facility is a continuous press designed to specifically produce panels almost paper thin, in a variety of widths and lengths. The process control and refining systems are modeled after technology used in the pulp and paper industry, an exacting manufacturing process that assures a fine fibered quality panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where you&amp;rsquo;ll find Reliance 200 HP RPM AC Inverter Duty motors. The press has the capability of making boards from 2.5 millimeters up to an inch-and-a-half thick. But the range of speeds required from the motor to produce the different boards is dramatic. To produce the thin material, you need to run 60 meters per minute, guaranteed throughout the process. The thicker material needs to be run at 10 to 20 meters per minute. The RPM AC Inverter Duty motor is ideal for this application because it can operate at over 1000:1 constant torque, with special base speeds, and at a wide constant HP range. In addition, multiples of these motors can be controlled to operate in a coordinated way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s critical that the motor provide constant torque at all of the speeds we need for the process,&amp;rdquo; states Hinman. &amp;ldquo;The Reliance product is able to perfectly match the correct speed through the entire system, driven from the press as the master all the way to the end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This line runs 24 hours a day and produces, on average, 110 feet of board per minute. It&amp;rsquo;s a highly profitable plant that produces $40 million a year in revenues. Plum Creek sells everything they make and they don&amp;rsquo;t keep inventory on the floor. That means if the line shuts down for any reason, they lose money at about a rate of $2,000 per hour. In a competitive market with thin margins, a motor failure can cause disaster. According to Plum Creek electrician John Conner, that&amp;rsquo;s another reason why they keep coming back to Reliance motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We track downtime with a very sophisticated automated system, so we are always identifying which components are giving us problems,&amp;rdquo; stated Conner. &amp;ldquo;Reliability is very critical, we&amp;rsquo;ve always had a good track record with Reliance motors, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are sticking with them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It All Comes Back to Partnership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Over his 29 years at the Plum Creek facility, Conner told us that he can name only a few standout partners, and Reliance is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It seems like every big project we&amp;rsquo;ve done here, we have depended on your company to help us,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We count on you as our go-to people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, Conner views Reliance as a long term player in the forest industry and a company that is committed to the isolated regions where Plum Creek locates. That&amp;rsquo;s very important to Conner and other engineers at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Who can we call in the middle of the night or on a Sunday afternoon to come help us? There are some folks that will do that, and some folks who aren&amp;rsquo;t set up to do that,&amp;rdquo; he adds. &amp;ldquo;Yes, the products are proven, but it&amp;rsquo;s the people that are really important. That&amp;rsquo;s why we keep coming back to Reliance motors.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/_3o2B05qQuM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Energy management considerations with today's drive systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	While it is valid to state that energy efficiency is defined as the same level of production being achieved at an overall lower energy cost, it is equally important for today&amp;rsquo;s machine builders and automation engineers alike to remember than an energy-efficient system can actually translate into higher productivity. This is achievable through a comprehensive approach to energy management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/siemens01.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Optimum energy monitoring and management are not products, they&amp;rsquo;re a process, according to Siemens Drive Technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy management is a process, rather than a product or series of products installed on a machine, or inline, to achieve a basic energy saving of kilowatt-hour consumption. This process must be ongoing and perpetual, meaning that any defined goal should be viewed as a momentary metric of achievement rather than a final end. While any vendor can supply the right products and support services to hit a target mark of energy savings, the mind-set of the customer is key in keeping the process recurrent. This ensures a continual increase in the productivity levels achieved, defined as a factor of the energy consumed. In many ways, it can be viewed in the same manner as an ongoing, effective but constantly evolving quality management system at your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/siemens02.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three essential elements are the basis of such a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, energy monitoring systems must be in place to effectively determine the current consumption. These can include, but are certainly not limited to, energy consumption displays, infeed/supply monitoring devices, power factor meters and more. Next, the proper calculation tools are needed to properly evaluate the life cycle costs of any investment. These tools can be as simple as a motor sizing chart or the software programs used to parameterize drives. However, a more formal mechatronics protocol may be beneficial to your operation. In this scenario, a thorough evaluation of both mechanical and electrical/electronic influences on your system, be it a machine or a process line, is conducted. The results can often open the eyes of machine designers, process engineers and system integrators alike. To realize the benefits of this analysis, the proper products and system solutions must be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/siemens03.jpg " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where a competent supplier can be an effective partner for your operation. For example, the solution you need might involve a vector drive that utilizes an energy optimization function to enhance the efficiency of the motor during partial load operations. In a system with multiple motors, energy savings might be realized to a substantial degree by the use of a drive unit with a common DC bus. The designer can also select the most appropriate infeed solution for the machine, pump or process operation, given the particulars of performance and required output. This may include an appropriately sized infeed unit with regenerative capability, the ability to put unused or braking energy back on the incoming power line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some applications may allow the use of high-efficiency standard induction motors and, in the process, realize a potential savings of 1 to 3 percent. The use of frequency converters (VFD) for speed control might raise this to an 8 to 10 percent savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Optimizing your entire system through mechatronic analysis of the machine or process design can result in a potential savings of 15 to 20 percent by the avoidance of over-dimensioning of motors, plus partial load optimization by means of energy-related flow control. This analysis may also point to the ability to use controlled energy infeed and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to determine the true efficiency of any drive system, it is necessary to demonstrate the amount of energy required by its power components and a corresponding examination of how the system uses energy. Also consider how different drive concepts are used on the same system under identical power load. This latter exercise might look into partial load efficiencies with various motor and drive combinations, straight comparisons between synchronous servo vs. asynchronous induction motors or direct drive vs. motor/gearbox combinations, drives with braking components vs. regenerative drive technology, as well as solutions with single vs. multi-drive, common DC bus solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A corollary to this discussion also should include a review of potential hydraulic/pneumatic component changeouts in certain applications where replacement with an integrated package of motion control and PLC technology might better resolve closed-loop pressure control of axes. Fewer components and their related power consumption can lead to overall system productivity improvements, as well as ongoing enhanced energy efficiencies. Reduced programming, diagnostic and commissioning times can also flow from such an approach, providing even more opportunities for overall machine or process improvements. Tracking the energy efficiency of such a system may seem problematic at first, but here again, today&amp;rsquo;s sophisticated mechatronic and virtual production protocols can be utilized to validate the real-world performance characteristics of such designs far in advance of their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the emergence of new technologies has impacted many of the products used in energy-efficient systems, it is equally important to take a more holistic look at operational sequences and the overall integration scheme when designing, retrofitting or rebuilding for improved energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip: Verify the cleanliness of your test leads</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When using test equipment to determine the health and reliability of your electric motors, it is important to also verify the cleanliness of your test leads. Don&amp;#39;t allow poor maintenance of your test leads, clips and connectors to reduce the accuracy of the resistance measurement readings. During calibration of the MCE test equipment, PdMA technicians often find test leads with damaged clips or contaminated connectors from everyday usage in industrial environments. Test leads, clips and connectors can be cleaned with an alcohol-based product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the phase-to-phase resistance measurement, the advanced 4-wire bridge testing performed by equipment like the MCE offers a&amp;nbsp;reduced concern for test lead connections because the effect of a variable test lead resistance is minimized using the 4-wire design. However, contaminated connectors on test leads used for resistance-to-ground measurements on motors under the test voltage stress of 1,000 to 5,000 volts can be an issue, especially when performing acceptance testing on new or refurbished motors. New and refurbished motors have resistance-to-ground readings in the thousands of Meg or Gigohm range. Some even reach the million Meg or Teraohm range. The MCE provides ranges high enough to measure these values, but to ensure accurate readings of resistance-to-ground at such high levels, perform visual inspections of your test leads and connectors to identify any deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>The importance of trending in electric motor reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Two weeks ago, we discussed the importance of quality assurance (QA) to ensure a healthy start toward achieving a full design life expectancy of the motor. This week, we want to continue with the second of the three basic reliability fundamentals (QA, trending and troubleshooting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trend is your friend, and this is never more obvious than when a catastrophic failure occurs with no historical comparison available. Unfortunately, all too often, the first test performed is the post-failure test. Not all tests are going to present an obvious fault. Instead, they will present a slow trend that will alert the analyst with a change from baseline alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, allocate the necessary time to collect data at the recommended intervals based on the criticality of the asset being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

	Where are you storing your manufacturer&amp;#39;s data sheets for electric motors? On visits to various facilities, we found many data sheets located inside the switchgear&amp;#39;s empty cubical where an electrical component was recently replaced in that particular motor control center. Seems like as good a place as any to store them, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What program have you put into place to file your manufacturer&amp;#39;s data sheets? You know, those folded-up sheets that are included with all of the electrical components you have purchased over the years. There is a wealth of information available on the sheets. Develop a central location or binder for the sheets that come with each push button, relay, contact overload heater, or any other small component that you have had to install or replace over the years. Keeping this information in one central location will result in you having a great reference tool. Soon you will begin to wonder how you ever got along without this valuable reference library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>A history lesson on Rudolf Diesel, creator of the diesel engine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Here is some information about Rudolf Diesel from a news release from &lt;a href="http://www.biodiesel.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.biodiesel.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No other engine inventor&amp;#39;s name is as closely tied to his engine as Rudolf Diesel&amp;#39;s is. But Diesel worked hard to make it that way. Diesel started his education in Paris and spent most of his time in the museum of arts and crafts. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War forced him to leave Paris and go to London. He later studied in Munich under the German chemist Carl Von Linde. He invented the refrigeration system used now in many electrical refrigerators. Diesel grew to become a very important engineer and inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He attempted to find better ways to use steam as the working fluid in heat engines. His patents in 1892 and 1893 were not for the engine but for the cycle of an engine employing the compression-ignition technique. In this cycle there were four phases. He did not have one fully rolling until 1897.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diesel attacked the problem of the compression-ignition engine not as a new concept but as a refinement of the gas engine invented by Nikolaus Otto in 1876. He spent the rest of his life introducing his invention to the world. He had many problems with manufacturing, licensing and financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On September 29, 1913, Diesel vanished off the Harwich-Antwerp ferry crossing the channel to England and his body was never found. Since his death the diesel engine has been very helpful in manufacturing and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He originally designed the diesel engine to run on peanut oil. Only later did petroleum become the standard. In a 1912 speech, Diesel said &amp;quot;the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today, but such oils may become, in the course of time, as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Diesel revised his original model and on February 17, 1894, the new engine ran for more than a minute. It took nearly three years to produce a viable working model. The engine he produced had a mechanical efficiency of more than 75 percent where the steam engines of the time were operating on less than 10 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/i89sSysf_wo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Quality control is the first step to motor reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Getting a motor off to a healthy start is critical to achieve the design life expectancy of the motor. A good quality control program is necessary to ensure this healthy start. Quality control includes verification of the motor manufacturing or repair as well as the power circuit and power quality of the application the motor is going to be installed in. Additionally a motor coming out of a warehouse should be re-inspected for degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Siemensâ new low-vibration motor exceeds IEEE standards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Siemens Industry Inc. recently introduced a completely new design concept for the low vibration version of its rugged SD100 IEEE841 motor. The frame, bearing housings, stator and rotor employ technologically advanced designs to surpass the demanding vibration requirements of the IEEE Standard 841-2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IEEE Std 841-2009 requires 3,600 rpm motors to operate with a maximum filtered vibration of .05 inch/second at twice speed or twice line frequency. This specification is particularly difficult to meet in the horizontal plane. Test results of .033 inches/second have been recorded, demonstrating the new low vibration motor not only meets the standard but exceeds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new low vibration SD100 IEEE841 motor is well suited for a wide variety of severe duty applications in industries, such as petrochemical and paper processing. Features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rugged cast iron frame, bearing housings, fan cover and conduit box&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Double-drilled (8 mounting holes) feet for easy installation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		6-Bolt bearing housings for improved stiffness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		NEMA Premium or higher efficiencies to lower operating costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inpro/Seal bearing isolators on both ends of the motor to protect bearings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inverter-rated insulation system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To provide users a variety of application options, the motors are available in three configurations: stock, modifiable through Siemens&amp;rsquo; unique QuikMOD program, or custom-built to meet specific customer requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/DxHJyTMTVqE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SKF provides critical machinery vibration monitoring and protection solution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SKF offers the Multilog On-line System DMx, a multi-featured vibration monitor for both conventional and hazardous environments. Awarded ATEX, IECEx, and cULus certifications, the DMx monitoring system can be directly installed within a hazardous area, removing or reducing cabling, cabinets and isolation barriers, and ultimately saving time and money during installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Multilog DMx system combines both protection (to help avoid catastrophic failures) and condition monitoring functionality in a single device, making it ideal for monitoring critical machinery such as gas turbines, generator sets, motors, pumps and compressors in the hydrocarbon processing Industry (HPI), power generation industry and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Until now, field-installed intrinsically safe vibration devices have been confined to simple transmitters that provide only basic machine health information,&amp;rdquo; said Chris James, business area director, SKF Reliability Systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The complexity of the vibration measurement has been in conflict with the power restrictions imposed by intrinsic safety. With the DMx, we&amp;#39;ve been able to resolve this conflict and offer a vibration monitoring solution that &amp;ndash; for the first time &amp;ndash; allows the requirements of critical machinery monitoring, from transducer to dynamic data processing, to be fulfilled by an intrinsically safe device located on the machine skid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SKF Multilog DMx system&amp;rsquo;s modular design, distributed architecture and small footprint have cost and installation advantages over traditional 19-inch rack systems, including energy savings due to the low power consumption of this intrinsically safe device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Features include four dynamic input channels for vibration, axial thrust and dynamic pressure, with two channels for speed/phase measurements. Multiple LEDs provide local indications of module, channel and alarm status and diagnostic data. The device can be easily connected to plant control and information networks by common protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Multilog DMx functions as an independent monitor or as a complete system connecting to plant-wide fieldbus infrastructure and SKF&amp;rsquo;s asset management tool &amp;ndash; @ptitude Monitoring Suite. The DMx has been adopted in many HPI sites around the world for critical plant applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How a reliability engineer improves reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	International standards define reliability as the probability that a unit will perform its required functions, without failure for a specified time period when used under specified conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The reliability of an asset is set in the design phase of that unit&amp;rsquo;s life. Of course, the production phase can introduce changes to the design reliability, normally reducing it. This is the delivered reliability. Then the asset must be installed, introducing the uncertainties of quality of workmanship and oversight. After installation, the power is applied and the asset is activated and operated, creating even more uncertainty as to the actual reliability on the shop floor. When the asset has a problem, the thoroughness and quality of the maintenance performed to restore it to its original state can also vary. All of these elements affect the achieved reliability of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To a large extent, the achieved reliability of an asset is controllable first, by the manufacturer (OEM), and then by the owner/end-user. When an asset is manufactured, reliability engineers participate in design efforts to guide the reliability (and maintainability) of new products. During production, the reliability engineers monitor the prototype and production testing, which they had a hand in designing, to monitor the delivered reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At installation, world-class companies routinely assign reliability engineers to the construction/installation team to help ensure that the asset is put into an operational status in the proper condition. Reliability engineers also work with the design team to develop the asset&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program. This would include bill of materials (BOM), operator maintenance plans, and the preventive and predictive maintenance guidelines that are passed on to the owner at commissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers at the owner/end-user organization also play an important role. In a world-class operation, reliability engineers accept the data input from the OEM. This information is installed into the end-user&amp;rsquo;s data files and provides the basis for the asset hierarchy, asset maintenance plan, initial spares procurement and required training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The end-user reliability engineers will have had a part in the procurement of the new asset from the original requirement for that asset. Typically, reliability engineers are generalists. Part of their function is to provide the purchasing department with the &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; requirements for new assets. These requirements include ensuring that the proper data is required that allows building the asset bill of materials and provides the necessary information for any predictive maintenance program envisioned for the asset. The requirements also will address the allowable unbalance in rotating equipment, allowable vibration levels, degree of alignment on coupled machines and quite possibly the lubricant to be used in common items such as motors, gearboxes, etc. The end-user reliability engineers also will play a large part in the commissioning process, including verification of all of the &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; requirements prior to acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is all well and good if you are in a world-class operation. But, what if you are trying to get to world class and need to justify an investment in reliability engineering? How can you show that a reliability engineer adds value? Here are some of the ways a reliability engineer can improve your achieved asset reliability, saving your organization time and money. (Keep in mind that increasing asset utilization by only 1 percent can drive measurable bottom line improvement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Outside the Box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tangible benefits come from thinking outside of the usual comfort zone of the organization. Poor practices become ingrained and lead to &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it that way&amp;rdquo; attitudes. An example is in the expected service life of equipment. Buying purely on cost is seldom a good practice for equipment. In one meat plant, buying totally enclosed fan-cooled (TEFC) motors was the norm as they cost less than washdown-rated motors. Of course, the area required a daily washdown. Convincing management that three to six months service life was not the norm &amp;ndash; and that the plant could do better &amp;ndash; allowed a trial purchase of washdown-rated motors. Changing to washdown-rated motors increased the unit cost by approximately 20 percent. Many of those motors have exceeded 10 years service to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-examine Shutdown Practices&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;During an annual shutdown, I watched a crew change belts on a critical air-handler. I watched as the 5 D size belts were rolled on over a bar. I asked the obvious question of why that was being done. &amp;ldquo;You have to pre-stretch the belts or come back later and retension them,&amp;rdquo; I was told. Taking this information up to our HVAC lead, I asked him where this information had come from. He informed me that he had been taught the trade by his father, who was a master mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While I did not doubt his explanation or his father&amp;rsquo;s skills, I asked when his father had done his apprenticeship. His father had been one of the very early HVAC specialists in the area and was trained before V-belts were strengthened with cording. Our belting vendor was brought in for a training session where myths about belts were discussed. Following that session, we changed our maintenance instructions to require loosening the motor, properly installing the belts and then setting the tension. Of course, this added about 15 percent more time to accomplish than the original, so how did this change affect reliability? By not damaging the belts during the installation, we changed the task from an annual one to a tri-annual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the Air Filter System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Many facilities have stringent requirements for the quality and quantity of the inside air. Traditionally, this air quality required changing filters on a strict time basis to keep from overloading and possibly tearing the filter media. But most of these facilities also keep track of the differential pressure across the filter banks. Using readily available information on the loading and potential weakening of a filter bank allows the filters to be changed on a condition basis rather than strictly time. As an offshoot, many facilities find that the change interval is lengthened on the side of the building that is on the upwind side of normally prevailing winds. This also increased the achieved life of some filter elements, decreasing total cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the Effectiveness of Maintenance Tasks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Reliability engineers also can help reduce overtime. Many of the maintenance tasks that a workforce accomplishes are of dubious value. In one case, an analysis of existing preventive maintenance tasks found that fully 40 percent had no value or did not address valid failure modes for the system. Removing these tasks from the schedule freed up time to accomplish not only the preventive maintenance program but also more time to accomplish corrective tasks without the firefighting that normally occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a research facility, this was especially evident when the annual shutdown of a building started on Saturday at 6 a.m. and went until 6 p.m. that day, started up again at 6 a.m. on Sunday and was normally completed by 4 p.m. The first eight hours on Saturday was time and a half; the last four were double time. Sunday was double time and a half. The entire maintenance staff was required to be on board for this evolution. The following year, after an analysis of the shutdown maintenance requirements, the shutdown started at 4 a.m. for fire system (statutory) cleaning. The bulk of the maintenance force started at 7 a.m. and the job was done by 4 p.m. that day. Not only were there no adverse events from this work, there was a marked reduction in trouble calls on overhauled equipment in the two weeks following the evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use Predictive Technologies to Find and Correct Energy Losses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One benefit of reliability engineering that is often overlooked is the potential to lower energy costs in a plant. Using predictive technologies allows plant personnel to find energy losses and correct them. These savings are over and above the &amp;ldquo;green initiative&amp;rdquo; savings through such items as lights, improved insulation, etc. One plant used airborne ultrasound to document air leaks that cost (electricity only) $33,000 annually. Additionally, one large air compressor was taken off line with a corresponding decrease in parts and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another plant used infrared to map an oven which was in need of repair or replacement but was not in the budget cycle. The detailed scans coupled with thermal calculations showed the oven was only 6 percent efficient. The visual proof convinced corporate to invest in a new oven that is showing more than 96 percent thermal efficiency. The decrease in natural gas usage has shortened the payback period significantly. Additional energy savings can come from using premium electric motors in the plant. For example, a 200-horsepower premium efficiency NEMA TEFC motor with electricity costs of $.06 per kilowatt hour will save more than $2,100 per year. It is not hard to see a long-term saving by using this type of motor; this should be factored into any repair or replace program for motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the benefits of the reliability engineering activities mentioned above, keep in mind that there are many additional benefits that may be hard to measure but are nevertheless important to the organization. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Correlation between increased reliability and safety: &lt;/strong&gt;Numerous studies have shown that plants with high reliability and excellent maintenance programs have a lower safety incident rate than those without such programs. It stands to reason that if operations are carried out in an efficient manner, there is less haste to complete actions and less risk of an injury by carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Correlation between reliability and quality: &lt;/strong&gt;It stands to reason that a process or batch line that runs without interruption is more likely to produce a consistent product than one that is subject to starts and stops during the production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Control of spare parts: &lt;/strong&gt;With an accurate asset hierarchy and bill of materials, it is easier to carry the right quantities of parts. Couple this with an accurate CMMS and economic order quantities can be fine tuned. Along with parts, a reliability engineer will scrub the lubricant list of a plant and look for opportunities to consolidate and standardize lubricants to decrease the total cost of ownership. This subject also has been detailed in various professional journals and can make an impact not only of carrying costs of supplies but also on energy usage and disposal costs of lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reliability engineers are valuable members of a manufacturing organization&amp;rsquo;s team. Through their efforts to improve the reliability of processes and equipment, they consistently increase asset availability and use resources more efficiently. While some results are easy to quantify and others not so obvious, the value goes directly to the bottom line of the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/tbP1ItqYwH4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Interview with Heinz Reisser, inventor of the CHB engine</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;This interview with Heinz Reisser discusses the function of the CHB Engine Family. The CHB engine is a much more efficient means of propulsion than common internal combustion engines. It makes use of the REISSER-CYCLE to produce a level of efficiency of 67 percent. This is a 22&amp;nbsp;percent increase over common diesel engines. While increasing the power output, power to weight ratio, the emissions and oil lubrication are reduced and the latter eliminated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Publication explains factors for selecting bearings for gearboxes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The process of selecting bearings for all gearbox types is set to become more straightforward, structured and transparent with the launch of a new free publication, &amp;ldquo;Rolling Bearings for Industrial Gearboxes&amp;rdquo;, from NSK.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NSK supplies bearings for all aspects of gearbox operation, and the new publication reflects this in the breadth of subject matter, which is designed to help users understand all the key areas that must be considered when selecting particular bearing types for converting and translating motion.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Rolling Bearings for gearboxes extends to 31 pages and is divided into eight sections. Section one gives an overview of all current gear designs &amp;ndash; worm, hypoid bevel, epicyclics, spur and bevel types &amp;ndash; outlining their advantages and disadvantages. Section two then moves on to discuss the numerous factors that affect bearing performance in gearboxes; factors such as load, speed, friction, environment, shaft arrangements, lubrication, assembly space &amp;ndash; and many more. All of these are considered individually with guidance as to the relevant questions to ask regarding each specific factor.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Section three deals with bearing types and their characteristics; here the user is helped by simple-to-use graphics; the first listing bearing types, and their capabilities, as regards loads, speeds, misalignment, and lubrication medium. The second graphic extends this information with an easy-to-read table that gives at-a-glance reference for the suitability of specific bearing types for a given set of operating parameters.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The following sections, four and five, are the most technical of the publication. The former looks at bearing positions inside gearboxes; it considers support by fixed and floating bearings, adjusted bearing support and floating bearing support. Here again graphics are used for illustration; this time in the form of a two- page table that shows most types of bearing arrangements, provides comments on them, and gives fields of application.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Next is a section that considers bearing life; this includes details on NSK&amp;rsquo;s latest optimized methods and calculation procedures such as the ABLE-Forecaster (Advanced Bearing Life Equation) software, and STIFF, a program developed by NSK that considers important parameters such as deformation of shafts and housings, misalignment, displacement of the bearing itself (and adjacent bearings), as well as internal operating cycles.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The final three sections devote seven pages to materials, lubrication, the consequences of lack of it, and proper dimensioning of bearings. As regards materials, the publication highlights NSK&amp;rsquo;s development of ground-breaking Super TF steel. This material sets new benchmarks for reliable operation in contaminated operating conditions, or applications where high stress factors are encountered. The new material can be employed in a wide range of bearing types.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The penultimate lubrication section provides a useful calculation of the quantity of oil required for optimum bearing performance; it considers whether oil or grease is best; and concludes with a graphic table giving details of damage caused by lubrication problems.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Completing what is a very comprehensive, concise publication, the final section deals with Proper Dimensioning of bearings. It gives procedures for proper fit selection, and tables detailing fits for radial bearings with housings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Motors guidance on frequency response, range and resolution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Technology manufacturers print a lot of things on specification sheets. Some even push the integrity limits of writing specs, which has developed into its own slang term called &amp;ldquo;specmanship&amp;rdquo;. When reviewing specs for technology designed to perform spectral analysis of a current signal, it is important to understand the differences between frequency response, range and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Frequency response &lt;/strong&gt;refers to the accuracy of frequency measurement across a given range. In online motor testing, an example is a frequency response from 10 hertz to 20 kilohertz with a tolerance of +/- 3dB. The tolerance (+/- dB) refers to how accurate the measurement is across a given frequency range. The lower the +/-dB number, the higher quality the frequency response and the more accurate the measurement is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Frequency range &lt;/strong&gt;refers to the range of frequencies which the equipment is capable of measuring, but without reference to the accuracy or &amp;quot;flatness&amp;quot; of the actual response across the range. For example, the frequency range from 10Hz to 20kHz with a tolerance of +/-10 dB is very poor quality in comparison to the tolerance of +/- 3dB from the previous example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Frequency resolution &lt;/strong&gt;describes the resolution of the frequency spectrum delivered by the technology. This is critical because a frequency range of 20kHz sounds impressive, but based on the sampling rate and number of samples it may not be very impressive. A frequency resolution of 1Hz means that every time you move the cursor one increment it jumps 1Hz. This calculates to 20,000 lines of resolution (20,000 Hz / 1 Hz per line = 20,000 Lines). That is insufficient for the analysis of rotor bar integrity using a current spectrum. To properly analyze rotor bar integrity, 0.03 Hz per line of resolution (33 times the 1Hz example) is highly recommended.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Timken to outfit U.S. Army Apache helicopters</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Timken Company&amp;rsquo;s Aerospace and Defense business has received an order to provide an emergency supply of left-hand engine nose gearboxes for aftermarket use on the U.S. Army&amp;#39;s fleet of Apache Longbow helicopters. Timken is the only aftermarket manufacturer approved to supply all five gearboxes onboard the Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken produces the gearboxes for both original equipment and aftermarket use at its plant in Manchester, Conn. The left- and right-hand nose gearboxes transmit power from the engines to the main transmission, which powers the main rotor and all onboard systems. Timken also provides gearboxes for the Apache&amp;#39;s main transmission, intermediate and tail-rotor positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the gearboxes, Timken bearings are found on several other areas of the Apache, including GE Model T700 Engines, the Honeywell Model 36 Auxiliary Power Unit and in the Arrowhead infrared sensor system, which is used to ensure safe flight for varied climate conditions and support accurate target controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The Apache is a mission-critical system, and on-time delivery of replacement parts is paramount to the military meeting its operations timelines and objectives,&amp;quot; said J. Ron Menning, president of Timken&amp;#39;s Aerospace and Defense business segment. &amp;quot;The Army needs a supplier to meet a delivery imperative, and has placed trust in Timken. We plan to exceed their expectations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timken has been serving the aerospace industry for more than 70 years, providing precision-engineered components and assemblies for original-equipment and aftermarket customers. The company&amp;#39;s products span the lifecycle of aircraft, from turbine engine components, gears and transmissions to reconditioning services and an extensive, growing portfolio of FAA-approved replacement parts for a variety of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Timken Company&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Timken Company keeps the world turning with innovative friction management and power transmission products and services, enabling customers&amp;rsquo; machinery to perform more efficiently and reliably. Timken had sales of $3.1 billion in 2009. It has operations in 26 countries and approximately 17,000 employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/X6gaz9qFmOA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tips on the storage of spare electric motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It appears the storage of spare motors is a pretty hot topic for many of the motor programs out there. After a short reminder on the importance of rotating the shafts of stored motors and the need to minimize their exposure to vibration, many of our customers wrote back to share their best methods. To everyone who took the time to write us back, thank you, and here are some of the comments for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One customer made a very good suggestion on how to minimize waste and vibration. At their facility not only do they store their motors on wooden pallets, but they use their worn conveyor belts as added vibration absorbing padding material between the pallet and the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several customers mentioned that they turn their shafts annually as part of their procedures to maintain the grease coating on the rollers of the bearing. Two even mentioned that they make sure to rotate the shafts several turns in both directions to ensure a really good coating. Semiannual shaft rotation was the most commonly reported periodicity for shaft rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another&amp;nbsp;customer reported that the rotation of the motor shaft was to occur quarterly. All motors are stored so the shafts face the isle between the storage racks. Once a quarter they rotate the shafts two and one-fourth turns. During the first quarter, all keyways will be at zero degrees (facing upward). Once they move into the second quarter all the keyways will be at 90 degrees and so on. This serves as a quick visual check that allows anyone to know if the shafts are being rotated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In &amp;quot;Principles of Large AC Motors&amp;quot; by the Electrical Apparatus Service Association it is recommended to rotate the shaft monthly. However, each motor and bearing manufacturer have their own recommendations. One motor manufacturer provides a chart ranging from weekly to every two months based on storage conditions. The one thing we do know is the shaft needs to be rotated to maintain the health of the bearings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chevy approaches 100% reliability in engines and transmissions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the month of January, 99.3 percent of the 1.8 million Chevrolet vehicles enrolled in OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics reported that there were no issues with the key components of their engine and transmission systems. The Chevrolet Malibu&amp;rsquo;s engine and transmission systems reported no issues in 99.7 percent of the vehicles checked by OnStar. These are aggregate numbers of vehicles showing &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; status in their OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For Chevrolet general manager Jim Campbell, this data illustrates the peace of mind Chevrolet and OnStar offer customers: &amp;ldquo;At Chevrolet, we have significantly reduced customer warranty claims over the past few years, as we continually strive to make the most dependable cars and trucks on the road. A key part of that success is OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics, which helps Chevrolet and our customers keep vehicles in top running condition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics automatically reports the status of hundreds of diagnostic checks performed on key vehicle operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results are sent via e-mail to the vehicle owner each month, with red, yellow and green icons indicating the operating status of their vehicle. The e-mail report also provides maintenance reminders based on the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s current odometer reading, remaining engine oil-life and other relevant vehicle ownership and OnStar subscription information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the program began in 2006, OnStar has sent a total of 122 million vehicle reports to subscribers. This represents tens of millions of data points engineering teams utilize to constantly improve the quality of Chevrolet cars and trucks. In addition, these reports provide a convenient way for individuals to monitor the health of the key systems in their vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;These monthly reports offer assurance to customers that their vehicle&amp;rsquo;s key systems are in good working order,&amp;rdquo; says Tony DiSalle, vice president of OnStar sales, service and marketing. &amp;ldquo;In addition, these reports help customers to monitor their preventative maintenance needs &amp;ndash; and to avoid the cost and inconvenience of unnecessary repairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For Chevrolet owners, the OnStar Vehicle Diagnostic reports in January found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		11.3 percent of vehicles were due for an oil change, which can impact both fuel economy and engine life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		35.8 percent of vehicles had at least one tire outside of the recommended range for tire pressure, which can impact both fuel economy and vehicle handling.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		3.7 percent of vehicles reported the need for their first tire rotation, which prevents irregular wear and premature tire replacement.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>The impact of condition on motor efficiency and reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	This article discusses the financial impact of motor condition on electric motor efficiency and reliability by reviewing a combination of motor circuit analysis (MCA) and vibration techniques. Cost impacts on energy, production and maintenance will be outlined. The topic will surround a utility study and U.S. Department of Energy market transformation success during 2000 and 2001. The primary areas of concern are phase balance, rotor bars, cleanliness and bearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motors are the prime mover of industry and our general comfort in commercial buildings. The motor systems consume 20 percent of all energy used in the United States and 59 percent of all electricity generated. Within each sector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		78% of electrical energy in industrial systems (greater than 90% in process industries)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		43% of the electrical energy in commercial buildings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		37% of the electrical energy in the home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are well over 1.2 billion electric motors, of all types, used throughout the United States. However, electric motors are often out-of-sight, out-of-mind until production is down due to a burnout or catastrophic bearing failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to understand that equipment usually fails over time, reliability decreases and losses increase (efficiency decreases) over time prior to most catastrophic failures. Although some equipment faults are instantaneous, the larger majority of catastrophic faults that impact production are the result of a failure in the implementation of a maintenance program. This failure is primarily due to management not fully understanding that maintenance is an investment in the business and not an expense of doing business. If you do not invest in materials, equipment and people, you do not have product to sell: If you do not invest in predictive maintenance practices (preventive maintenance, Total Productive Maintenance, Reliability-Centered Maintenance or any other program), you do not have product to sell or less of it at a higher overall production cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Proper implementation of a maintenance program has been shown to reduce energy consumption in plants by as much as 14% &lt;sup&gt;1 2&lt;/sup&gt;, while also reducing unplanned production downtime. Average downtime costs are shown as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="93" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose001.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Estimations for Downtime Costs &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a recent utility energy and reliability project, a group of electric motors from five to 200 horsepower were reviewed in several industries, including: Petroleum and Chemical; Forest Products; Food Processing; Mining (Quarry); and Pulp &amp;amp; Paper. The plants varied from having no existing planned maintenance program to full implementation, including an existing energy program. Of these motors, randomly evaluated, 80% were found to have at least one deficiency with 60% of those (48% of the original) found to be cost effective to replace. The plants without programs had the greatest number of defective motors; the plants with existing maintenance and energy programs had the least number of defective motors. Eight percent of the motors were evaluated to determine the types of faults and the potential cost avoidance with corrective action (repair or replace) by using vibration analysis and motor circuit analysis (MCA). Several had a combination of electrical and mechanical problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="59" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose002.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 2: Utility Energy Project Findings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several motors had combined vibration and electrical faults. A few had winding faults combined with insulation resistance faults. Several had shorted windings that were continuing to cause production problems, but were written off as nuisance trips (detected in the study by using MCA). &amp;ldquo;Findings of the advanced portion of the Motor PAT Tool demonstration project indicate that measuring for phase unbalance of resistance, inductance, impedance, phase angle and I/F (current/frequency response) provided more useful results.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The combined incremental production cost avoidance of 20 of the defective motors, from five to 250 horsepower, was $297,100, rendering implementation costs insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The purpose of this article is to first provide information for determining cost avoidance through the application of a maintenance program on electric motors. This will be followed with a discussion of the implementation of motor circuit analysis (MCA) and vibration analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost Avoidance through Maintenance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are a number of ways to determine cost avoidance through the implementation of maintenance programs. In this discussion, the focus will be on the methods introduced through the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs), which provide a very basic and conservative method. The PAT Tool Demonstration Project used a much more complex method &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which is outside the scope of this article. However, some of the tools, such as MotorMaster Plus &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, will be used to provide cost information for motor repair costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utility representatives have indicated that in a survey of facilities with no preventive maintenance programs, motor rewinds represented 85% of the total number of motor repairs (on average). After preventive maintenance programs were established, the number of rewinds were reduced to about 20% of the total. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This statement has been found to hold true through research projects including: Dreisilker&amp;rsquo;s Total Motor System Maintenance and Management Program (DTM 2), the PAT Tool Project, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the purpose of this discussion, we will consider a paperboard plant with 485 motors. There are two operating production lines that have a potential downtime cost of $6,575 each. An average of three motors were repaired per month, of which a majority (70%) required rewind replacement (normally caused by immersion, contamination or the motors became coated in material). The facility operated 8,000 hours per year, with the catastrophic failures normally causing one line to fail at a time. Additional costs not covered by this discussion included cleaning of the system prior to restarting the operation. No maintenance program in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="184" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose003.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 3: Breakdown of Motor Horsepower and Repair Costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first step is to calculate the unplanned production downtime costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 1: Unplanned Production Downtime Cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PC&lt;sub&gt;Downtime&lt;/sub&gt; = (MF/year) x (P&lt;sub&gt;Lost&lt;/sub&gt;/failure) x (P&lt;sub&gt;Cost&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (36 motors/year) x (4 hours/failure) x ($6,575/hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $946,800/year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Where PC is the annual cost of unplanned downtime, MF is the number of motor failures, P represents production.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 2 is to calculate the average cost of rewinding equipment. In this case, we will concentrate on just 20 horsepower and larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 2: Average Cost of Rewinding Motors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = ((N&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; x RWC&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;) + &amp;hellip; + (Nnn x RWC&lt;sub&gt;nn&lt;/sub&gt;))/N&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= ((15&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; x $660&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) + (10&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; x $760&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;) + &amp;hellip; + (4&lt;sub&gt;750&lt;/sub&gt; x $7735&lt;sub&gt;750&lt;/sub&gt;)) / 138 motors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,650&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Where R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; is the average rewind cost, N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motors for each horsepower, RWC&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the rewind cost for each horsepower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The average cost for reconditioning the motors is calculated the same way, except the reconditioning cost is used instead of rewind costs. For this example, the average reconditioning cost would be $555.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 3 is to calculate the average repair cost per motor before and after maintenance implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 3: Average Repair Cost per Motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	R&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt; = (% Recondition x $/Recondition) + (% Rewind x $/Rewind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (30% x $555) + (70% x $1,650)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,322 / motor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assuming that the number of motors rewound vs. reconditioned would be inverse with the application of the program, the number of rewound motors would be 30%, and the average cost of repair would be $884 per motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the program is implemented, the number of motors to be repaired, overall, will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 4 uses the number of motors repaired per year and the difference between the reconditioned motors vs. rewound in order to come up with a conservative estimate of savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 4: Repair Cost Reduction Estimate (RRC&lt;sub&gt;est&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RRC&lt;sub&gt;est&lt;/sub&gt; = (motors repaired/year x initial repair costs) (motors repaired/year x new repair costs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (36 motors/year x $1,322/motor) (36 motors/year x $884/motor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $15,768 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 5 is to determine potential energy savings. For the purposes of conservative estimation, a 2% improvement in efficiency will be assumed. Maintenance components include (and the type of test system, vibration and MCA only, for this article, used to evaluate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved lubrication (vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Proper alignment and balancing (vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Correction of circuit unbalances (MCA)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced motor temperatures (MCA, vibration)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduced efficiency losses caused by rewinds (U.S. Department of Energy estimates one percentage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		point efficiency reduction per rewind)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved drive system performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 5: Energy Cost Savings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Energy Savings = (total hp of motors considered) x (load factor) x (operating hours) x (%savings) x (.746 kW/hp) x (Electrical usage costs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 14,930 horsepower x 75% load x 8,000 hrs x 2% savings x 0.746 kW/hp x $0.06/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $80,192 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 6 is to determine the in-house labor costs to implement the program. Assume one man-hour per motor per year. Estimated costs for this example will be based upon $25 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 6: In-House Labor Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labor = (1 hour/month/motor) x (# of motors) x (12 months/year) x ($/man-hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 1hour/month/motor x 138 motors x 12 months/year x ($25/man-hour)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $41,400 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 7 is the purchase price for the MCA and vibration analysis equipment. For the purposes of this article, the same equipment selected for the utility PAT Project will be used. The estimated combined costs for the ALL-TEST IV &lt;em&gt;PRO &lt;/em&gt;2000 MCA instrument and the Pruftechnik vibration analysis equipment is $22,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Step 8 is the training costs for implementing the system. Assuming equipment training costs of $4,500 per person and maintenance training costs of $6,000 per person, the cost should be approximately $10,500 per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The final step is to determine the simple payback for the implementation of the program. In the case of this example, assume a 50% reduction in unplanned downtime for the first year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="74" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose004.gif" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 4: Costs and Savings for Maintenance Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 7: Simple Maintenance Payback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Payback = (Total Costs per Year) / (Total Savings per Year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $73,900 / $569,360&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 0.13 years or 1.6 months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The smaller size of this particular plant would allow for complete implementation of a maintenance program. Larger manufacturing plants will often have thousands of electric motors and may require a breakdown of departments or areas for successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of Vibration Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis is used by maintenance professionals as a means to detect mechanical and some limited electrical faults in rotating equipment. By performing regularly scheduled testing, the operating reliability of an electric motor can be determined through trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based upon bearing failure, greasing, belt tension, misalignment or other unbalances, increases in energy losses can occur. These losses show as vibration, noise and heat. Improper belt tension and greasing will increase the friction and windage losses of the motor. This can be calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 8: Bearing Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Watts Loss = (load,lbs x JournalDiameter,inches x rpm x f) / 169&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;f is dependent upon oil used and temperature; &amp;nbsp;0.005 is typical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vibration analysis for troubleshooting will detect bearing (41% of failures) faults, balance and alignment (12% of failures) faults, primarily. It will also detect rotor faults (10% of failures) and some electrical faults (37% of failures), to some extent. However, electrical and rotor faults tend to fall in frequency ranges that can be related to other equipment, and are directly load related. Vibration analysis requires the electric motor to be operating at a load that is constant during each test that would be trended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of Motor Circuit Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many tools available to perform quality preventive maintenance of individual motors. Of these, motor circuit analysis (MCA) systems hold great promise for identifying motor problems before expensive failure and for improving the general efficiency of motor systems in general. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor circuit analysis allows the analyst to detect winding faults and rotor faults in the electric motor. One power of this type of test method is that it requires the equipment to be de-energized, which allows for initial incoming testing of the electric motors and troubleshooting when equipment fails. Primary energy losses that can be detected include phase unbalance and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R losses, while faults include shorted windings, loose connections, ground faults and rotor faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A resistive fault gives of heat, as a loss. For instance, a 0.5-ohm loose connection on a 100-horsepower electric motor operating at 95 amps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 9: Resistive Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kilo-Watts Loss = (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R)/1000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= (95&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x 0.5)/1000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 4.5 kW (demand loss)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 10: Energy Usage Loss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	$/year = kW x hours/year x $/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 4.5 kW x 8000 hours/year x $0.06/kWh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $2,160 per year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric motor phase unbalances (inductance and impedance) affect the current unbalances, cause motors to run hotter and reduce the motor&amp;rsquo;s ability to produce torque. The percentage unbalance of impedance can be evaluated to determine efficiency reduction and additional heating of the electric motor. A general rule is that, for every 10 degrees Celsius increase in operating temperature, the life of the equipment is reduced by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="207" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose005.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Efficiency Reduction Due to Impedance Unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, the paperboard company has a 100-horsepower electric motor, that would normally be 95% efficient, that has a 3.5% impedance unbalance. The efficiency would be reduced by 4 points of efficiency, or to 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equation 10: Energy Cost Due to Phase Unbalance Losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	$/yr savings = hp x 0.746 x %load x $/kWh x hours of operation ((100/Le) (100/He))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= 100 hp x 0.756 x .75 load x $0.06/kWh x 8000 hours ((100/91) (100/95))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	= $1,240 / year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="216" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/penrose006.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Increase in Temperature Rise Due to Phase Unbalance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impedance unbalance will also cause an increase in operating temperature based upon an increase in I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R losses. In the case of the 100-horsepower electric motor, this means a temperature rise of about 30 degrees Celsius, or a reduction in motor insulation life to 13% of its original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Motor circuit analysis is also used to evaluate the windings for contamination. &amp;ldquo;Frequent cleaning of a motor&amp;rsquo;s intake (if any) and cooling fins is especially important in dirty environments. &amp;hellip; Tests confirm that even severe duty, generously rated, and oversized motors can quickly fail in such conditions if they become thickly coated or if lightly coated and with their airflow reduced by half. Their insulation life can then fall to 13 to 25% of normal.&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; The same phenomenon occurs if the windings become coated in contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The MCA rotor test requires inductance and impedance readings through 360 degrees of rotation of the rotor. The readings are graphed and viewed for symmetry. Rotor test results provide a definitive condition of the rotor and is often performed following identification of a possible rotor fault by vibration, as part of an acceptance program, during repair or when the motor is identified as having torque problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The implementation of an electric motor maintenance program will have a significant impact on a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. Whether the company has a few hundred motors or many thousands, the simple payback from the investment into vibration and MCA is usually termed in months. Payback is impacted from savings from production availability, reduced equipment repair costs and improved energy costs, all with a minimum investment in manpower, training and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The application of these two technologies complement one another while also evaluating the progress of the maintenance program and improving upon equipment availability. Vibration analysis evaluates the mechanical condition of equipment while MCA evaluates the electrical condition of equipment. Combined, the analyst has the ability to view the complete condition of the electric motor.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What is a double-cage rotor: A follow-up</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In PdMA&amp;rsquo;s January 5 tip, the company discussed what a double-cage rotor is. Now that you know some of the design characteristics of the double cage rotor, are there any special considerations that should be given for testing? Yes. More emphasis should be put on the acquisition of an In-Rush/Start-Up test as a baseline. The fact that the majority of the high-frequency start-up current exists in the smaller outer bar means that the majority of the start-up stresses occur in the outer bar. This increases the chance of stress cracks or breaks in the outer bar due to non-symmetrical thermal expansion. When the motor is at normal operating speed the current is more evenly distributed through both inner and outer bars reducing the influence of a fault in the outer&amp;nbsp;bar on the running current. This reduces the evidence of a faulty rotor bar and may delay the actions taken to reduce secondary damage to the stator. Comparison of the latest In-Rush/Start-Up test to the baseline test will give ample evidence of a change in the rotor health so action can be taken to prevent an unplanned outage.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An examination of false brinelling and static corrosion in bearings</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When an electric motor is not properly cared for during storage, damage to its bearings may occur. The two main failure modes that occur are false brinelling and static corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	False brinelling occurs when vibration from passing warehouse machinery results in the bearing&amp;#39;s rolling elements vibrating against the raceway in a single location. Over time, this vibration can remove small bits of metal. This type of wear appears as evenly spaced marks lining up with the spacing of the rolling elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Static corrosion occurs when either vibration or the weight of the rotor shaft resting on the rollers forces out the grease between the rollers and the bearing raceway. The problem is compounded if the grease has little or poor corrosion inhibitors. When the film is no longer present between the metal surfaces, galvanic corrosion occurs leading to rust deposits on the machined surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prevention is as simple as ensuring the bearings are properly greased prior to being placed in storage. The type of grease and date should be tagged to the motor. The motor itself should be placed on a vibration absorbing material such as wood. Finally on a routine basis the shaft of the motor should be rotated to ensure the grease is redistributed and maintains a corrosion preventing film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Tips to predict bearing failures, measure lube film thickness</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, there are two options of maintenance concerning electric motor bearings. One is to relubricate them and the other is to change them. Monitoring electric motor bearing condition is paramount to insure reliability. Electric motors are an asset that must be managed, and prolonging their life will insure more contribution to the bottom-line profit. Preventing collateral damage caused by electric motor bearing failure is true cost avoidance. There are several ways to monitor and measure bearing condition &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; ultrasonics, temperature, vibration analysis and shock pulse, just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because lubrication is the first line of defense for prolonging bearing life, it is imperative that the lubrication film thickness between the rolling elements and the raceways be measured and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lubrication film thickness: What matters&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lubrication is the vital element between any moving parts and an absolute requirement in rolling element bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There has always been much discussion and debate regarding the questions of how much, how often and what kinds of lubricants should be used in rolling element bearings; and to many, it still remains a mystery. The following chart (Figure 1) indicates the many parameters related to the lubrication film thickness and film quality in a rolling element bearing. Even &amp;ldquo;sealed for life&amp;rdquo; bearings will lose their lubrication film thickness. Knowing how much lubricant is left in a sealed bearing can make the difference between productive uptime and unscheduled downtime. Knowing if lubricant is getting into the bearing will allow maintenance to maximize bearing life by optimizing oil film thickness and unscheduled downtime can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Differentiating between bearing surface damage and lubrication film thickness, as a bearing fault, is a measurable function. Knowing the difference is valuable knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="366" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps001.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case study No. 1: Maxim Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scrubber for cleaning contaminated water before dispersing into the waste water system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Four small 3/4-horsepower motors with integral &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; face mounted impeller pumps plumbed with PVC piping.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All four motors are running at the same time. (Figure 2.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After demonstrating how to monitor bearing condition and measure lubrication film thickness at this printed circuit manufacturing plant, we were asked to look at a small water scrubber. The screaming sound of a bad bearing could be heard, but they could not pinpoint which bearing was making the noise. Was it the drive end or opposite drive end of which motor? After a quick check, the bearing was identified and its condition was determined. This was a 6204.2RS sealed bearing (a sealed-for-life bearing). The cost was about $9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We left the plant with the promise to provide a quotation for a portable data logger instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the night, the bearing froze up and tripped the motor, so only three motors were now running. They lost one-fourth of the capacity of the system to clean water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next day (before the repair could be made), the Bay Area Environmental Protection Agency inspector showed up. Water was still being dumped into the wastewater system. Because of the lessened capacity, when the water was tested, it did not meet the cleaned requirements. The fine was $32,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The sad part is that they knew which bearing was bad. They also knew how bad it was. If predictive maintenance or condition monitoring was a part of their normal operating procedures, this downtime and fine would have never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="242" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps002.jpg" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 2: Electric motor shop at Laprino Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 700-horsepower ABB electric motor for driving a fan for dehydrating milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB motors have long recommended the use of shock pulse to measure their motor bearings. Many ABB motors are equipped at the factory with SPM adapters for quick-connect measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A new ABB motor was installed at Laprino Foods and failed within the warranty period. The bearing froze up and twisted the shaft. There was no lubrication in the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After careful review, the records showed that the maintenance personnel in the plant had indeed greased the bearing according to the recommended schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seal cap was removed from the end bell of the drive end exposing the bearing for inspection. It was found that a machining error was made during manufacture and the grease pathway from the grease zerk to the bearing lubrication notch did not line up. Grease could not get into the bearing. Even though the lubrication schedule was being adhered to, the bearing was not being measured, so no one could tell if lubricant was actually getting into the bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Production was interrupted so a new motor was taken from the electric motor shop&amp;rsquo;s inventory to replace the damaged motor. Before installing the new motor, a test run was performed. While the motor was running, a measurement was taken while lubricant (grease) was applied to the zerk. Without disassembling the motor or causing an intrusive action, it was determined that the grease pathway was in the correct place and lubricant was truly getting into the bearing. The bearing&amp;rsquo;s true condition was determined and the lubricant film thickness was measured and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ABB honored the warranty. The damaged motor was repaired and stored for a spare and the new motor is still running today. An online monitoring system (MG-4) continues to monitor these ABB electric motor bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="312" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps003.jpg" width="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 3: Evanite Fiber Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A 125-horsepower motor and belt drive on an exhaust fan for a spun glass process used to make high-density filters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		This example was not necessarily on the motor, but on the fan shaft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common bearing installation faults that affects lubrication film thickness is the installation and set-up of the tapered bore, double-row spherical roller bearing using a split tapered adapter in a mounted unit (i.e. pillow block bearing). While this is not an electric motor bearing,it is in very close proximity to every drive motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The tapered adapter is used as a wedge device to hold the inter race of the bearing on to the shaft. All bearing manufacturers have recommended clearances for applying this type of bearing. This type of bearing in a pillow block housing is very common on larger fan applications and is a very popular style for many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="243" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps004.jpg" width="550" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the tapered sleeve (adapter) is drawn up too far by over-tightening the spanner nut (a very common practice), the internal clearance of the bearing will be removed, thus reducing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though these bearings are running with no apparent fault or vibration alarm, the reliability of the machine has been put into jeopardy because the operator cannot see the film thickness problem. Lubrication film thickness can be measured to determine the true condition of the bearing during start-up without setting a baseline and treading. Differentiating bearing surface damage faults and lubrication film thickness faults is powerful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Case No. 4: Superior Lumber Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25-horsepower motor driving an edger in a sawmill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standard foot mounted motors that are mounted in the vertical position must have special consideration related to lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The normally mounted bearing in a horizontal motor is supporting load/overhung load in the radical direction. If the motor is mounted in the vertical position, the bearing will see more thrust loads and the lubrication will run out through the opening of an open or shielded bearing. A sealed bearing will hold the lubricant reservoir in the lower half of the bearing because the bearing is lying on its side in this application. This position will also force all of the balls of a ball bearing to one side of the raceway, thus placing them all in a more loaded situation in both radial and thrust directions. Load affects the lubrication film thickness. Normally, a motor mounted in this position will need lubricating more often than what is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="298" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/phelps005.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The ability to measure the lubrication film thickness is paramount. Better asset management and machine reliability can be obtained by measuring the film thickness as soon as the machine is turned on. This will prolong bearing and machine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is critical. It can be measured to detect and troubleshoot for proper lubrication amounts (over/under), the right kind of lubricant for the right job, to detect installation faults and even to pinpoint the lack of film thickness if there is a compatibility and/or contamination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Knowing the film thickness of lubrication in rolling element bearings, even a sealed bearing, is information worth measuring. Lubricant should only be applied to rolling element bearings because of demand requirements. Measuring the bearing film thickness before you lubricate will insure that there is truly a lubrication requirement. Automatic lubrication supply systems can provide the optimum amount of lubrication at just the right time when signaled by an online measuring system. Knowing the lubrication film thickness in rolling element bearings is instrumental in best asset management practices. Knowing what really matters in rolling element bearings to insure machine reliability is knowing the lubrication film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/1SfkXA8h3KM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The lean replacement of bearings, pumps and motors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary downtime is not just an operations problem. The time that it takes to change out a bearing, a pump or a motor can add up over time to equal significant losses in production output. Eliminating non-value-added steps in the changeover of these parts will reduce scrap, improve equipment utilization and reduce labor costs while increasing total production output. The multi-step process includes eliminating waste in the process, identifying work that can be completed while the equipment is running (external work), and improving the reliability of both the internal and external work steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Improvements are ensured by creating effective work procedures and using workplace organization principles. Reductions in changeover time are typically 20 to 50 percent, or greater, depending on various system characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The principles of lean manufacturing are well known. The components of the methodology as well as the overriding philosophy have been written about exhaustively. What is left upon which to expound is the application of the lean methodology to more and greater diversity of manufacturing scenarios. This article endeavors to explain the major tenets of lean manufacturing and how certain lean tools might be applied to a common maintenance activity in order to generate significant improvements in overall business performance. The improvement from utilizing lean tools influences all business metrics &amp;ndash; not just maintenance or operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scene&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At 7 p.m., Bob received a call that a critical reactor pump was making a terrible noise. Never mind the fact that he was already working on a piece of equipment that operations said was critical (that is a scenario for a different article). The clock was ticking on this new problem and, like a well-mannered doctor, Bob hurried to the &amp;ldquo;patient&amp;rsquo;s bedside&amp;rdquo; to perform an initial examination. His diagnosis was that the pump was definitely near catastrophic failure. In fact, he thought it might not last until the end of the shift if it was allowed to continue to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob asked the operator to shut down the affected reactor, explaining that he would need to replace the failing pump. The operations group reassigned the operator to another job. Production output dropped accordingly and, even though operations knew how long the job always took, the area manager called Bob just to confirm that the diagnosis and prognosis were as suspected. Somehow the situation felt old and familiar to Bob. In fact, it felt too old &amp;ndash; and too familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob had been a maintenance technician for 10 years and was quite good at it. He paid close attention to detail, took great pride in the quality of his work and was generally open to new methods for increasing both the quality and quantity of the work that he was able to produce. Recently, he had been spending greater lengths of time contemplating how he could get more work done in a single shift. He already worked hard, but the work seemed to be coming quicker in recent months than he and his co-workers could sustain. There had to be a better way he thought as he began the work of replacing the reactor pump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old process&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Bob retrieves his toolbox and begins the process of removing the pump so that the new one can be installed. From experience (he has replaced pumps just like this one so many times that he can nearly do it without looking), he knows that the job will take eight hours from start to finish. Sometimes, of course, things do not go so smoothly and the job can run into several shifts of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Bob begins work on the pump removal, he begins to wonder if there is any way that the pump replacement process could be improved to reduce the time required. He knows that the job is not performed frequently, but it seems that it always has to be performed just when other assets are crippled and production demand is at its highest. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law, he supposes. Still, if the process time could be reduced, it would help maintenance and operations both. It occurred to him on his second trip to the stores area that one immediate improvement would be to eliminate these frustrating trips to retrieve tools, fasteners and other required parts that become necessary when the situation becomes abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During years of replacing these pumps, Bob has learned what common tools are required for the job. Of course, he carries these tools in his toolbox. However, his toolbox would be the size of a truck if he tried to carry every special tool and fastener that he might need for any job in the plant. He was definitely ready to make some improvements that would lower his frustration level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The principles of lean&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Over the past several months, Bob&amp;rsquo;s friend had been telling him about this methodology called lean manufacturing that companies were using to eliminate problems in their manufacturing environment. Bob&amp;rsquo;s friend told him that he thought some of these techniques would help Bob make improvements in his own job. Bob was skeptical but his friend finally convinced him to read some articles and a couple of books explaining the lean manufacturing concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The concepts he read about seemed quite radical and almost too simple for him to believe that they could really produce the benefits that they claimed. Nevertheless, he found some of the concepts curiously intriguing. In a last-ditch effort to make some sense of all of it, Bob decided to summarize for himself everything that he had learned so far. Then, he thought, he would give it one shot at work (when the time was just right, of course) to see if he could reap some of the reward that his buddy had been bragging about. If the methods did not work, he was not going to waste his time with this &amp;ldquo;lean stuff&amp;rdquo; any longer. On a piece of notebook paper, Bob wrote: Principles of Lean. Under this heading, he began to list them as he understood them from his reading. When he was finished, his list looked like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;Principles of Lean&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eliminate Waste (there are seven types of waste)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waiting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overproduction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Transportation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rework or Reprocessing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Defects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess Motion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Achieve Continuous Operation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use Only One-piece Flow&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organize the Workplace&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continually Improve (one improvement every day, no exceptions)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work Together (get ideas from anyone and everyone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thought crossed Bob&amp;rsquo;s mind immediately. This is certainly a simple philosophy &amp;ndash; only six major tenets as he saw it. He was beginning to think that there might be some merit to this methodology. In fact, he decided to simply identify some ways that he could try to apply some of the lean concepts to his work activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After looking over his ideas and spending a few days continuing to work in the current environment, Bob thought to himself that he might as well find out if these crazy ideas would work. After all, if they really worked to reduce operations downtime it would certainly be viewed as a great benefit for the business and reflect positively on him. He would start small and work slowly through the first exercise. If his lean activities did not produce improvement, he would revert to the old methods and cut his losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He made a second list that described specific ways that these concepts could help him be more efficient without compromising either safety or quality. This list was really going to be simply a &amp;ldquo;To-Do&amp;rdquo; list for his next pump replacement job. His second list looked like this when it was completed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;Lean Action Plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Map each step of the entire process identifying purpose of the step and how much time is consumed by the step&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify which steps contain waste and which type of waste&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify a way to eliminate (or, at least, reduce) the waste&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organize the area immediately around the reactor pump (make a place to store everything needed for the pump replacement job &amp;ndash; including common and special tools)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Look for ways to utilize quick-release features (e.g., fasteners, plumbing connections)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Document the new process so that it can be repeated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Armed with this list, a notebook and some markers (for creating a process map), and a healthy dose of skepticism, Bob headed for his manager&amp;rsquo;s office. If he could convince his manager of the potential improvements of a lean environment, he would be ready to start work on his first lean implementation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new process&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;After Bob&amp;rsquo;s first round of improvements he was convinced that the tools of lean manufacturing could actually work to make improvements in both the quality of the work he was doing and the time required to complete that work. As he reviewed the new process, he realized that his notes echoed what he had been studying in the lean texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new process was visibly different from the old process. The area had shelves and pegboard installed with labels identifying exactly what was to be located and where it was to be located. The contents on the shelves consisted of tools, fasteners and other items that were always (or nearly always) needed in the process of replacing a reactor pump. The shelves and other storage features were located as near to their points of use as reasonably possible. Bob found that this activity alone removed a significant amount of time from the total process time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The safety guards that were in place in the reactor area were another visible change. Bob was able to determine that the safety guarding was merely to prevent accidental ingress into unsafe areas of the reactor pump system. Consequently, there was no need for the guarding to be fastened with threaded fasteners which required excess time and energy to remove and were a periodic source of additional downtime as the threads would eventually be ruined and require more time for repair. In place of the threaded fasteners, Bob installed some quick release toggle clamps that were stocked in the stores inventory. He even managed to find a way to utilize quick connect couplings to speed the process of removing and installing the pump. Again, he was able to remove several minutes from the total cycle time through this simple change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, during his improvement exercise, Bob identified several steps of the pump replacement process that could be completed prior to stopping the production process. The total process time required to replace a reactor pump was measured from the moment the production process stopped until the moment it was restarted with the new pump. Therefore, Bob realized that performing as much work as possible prior to stopping production output would reduce the operations downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once he moved those tasks from internal to external (an internal task is one that can only be accomplished when the asset or production process is stopped), he found that he could make them a bit more efficient. This reduced the pump replacement time yet again. This was clearly a positive improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the efforts of his first improvement exercise, Bob identified several more ideas to implement in &amp;ldquo;Round 2.&amp;rdquo; He was certain that he could reduce the pump replacement time even further. In fact, he believed that his most radical idea would reduce the time required by an additional 50 percent &amp;ndash; maybe more. He was convinced that if he could find a way to implement the model used by auto racing&amp;rsquo;s pit crews, the pump replacement job could be performed using less than 20 percent of the time that was originally required. By his calculations (and with some help from the accounting department) he determined that the time saved would more than pay for the extra maintenance labor required for his &amp;ldquo;pump pit crew&amp;rdquo; idea. By now Bob is also certain that every technique that he has used to reduce pump replacement time can be applied to motors, bearings and, for that matter, any other work that he performs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The results that can be achieved through an implementation of the lean methodology vary dependent upon several factors. For example, in an environment where minimal improvement effort has been experienced historically, significant improvements will typically be realized immediately. Environments where a continuous improvement philosophy has existed for many years may achieve smaller improvements as a result of previous work. It is critical to note that, even in facilities where lean has been rigorously utilized for several years, there are still improvements gained each time an exercise similar to the one described in this paper is carried out. This is explained by the dynamic nature of manufacturing and the natural movement of all systems toward higher entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general, utilizing the tools of lean will generate improvements in four fundamental areas of any manufacturing or processing business. First, fewer inventories will be required as a result of a company&amp;rsquo;s flexibility to meet changing customer demands. Less inventory and increased flexibility lead to improvements in a second category &amp;ndash; faster delivery times. The third area that receives a boost from using the lean tools is quality. This includes the quality of product, processes and assets. Finally, shorter changeovers for production processes and reduced replacement times in maintenance work ultimately lead to reduced downtime which subsequently produces higher productivity. The target achieved by many companies for equipment setups or asset replacement activities is to perform them accurately and repeatedly in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quantifiable results from lean typically fall into the ranges shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		30 to 50% less human effort required throughout the plant&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		30 to 50% fewer defects in finished product&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		25 to 35% less engineering time required&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		45 to 55% less floor space for the same output&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5 to 15% less inventory (applies to product and spare parts)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		20 to 50% (or greater) reduction in changeover or asset replacement time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, as previously mentioned, these results can vary dependent upon the unique situations of each plant that endeavors to implement the tools and philosophy of lean manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The principles of lean manufacturing are really quite simple. At the heart of lean is a relentless drive to remove waste from any process. The targeted process can be virtually any task, job or project in a maintenance and reliability environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies utilizing lean techniques obtain improvements in flexibility, quality, delivery (or timeliness) and productivity. These improvements are recognized throughout the enterprise. This includes a company&amp;rsquo;s product and its processes including the work processes required for effective asset management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article has attempted to demystify the principles of the lean methodology. In addition, some of the more prominent tools are discussed and one possible application of the tools is described within an asset management environment. Finally, the results typically experienced by companies that implement lean are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

Any non-symmetric change in the resistive element of a three-phase circuit will create an imbalance in voltage and current. This imbalance results in inefficient circulating currents that produce elevated winding temperature without performing any real work. A study conducted in the mid-1990s determined that more than 46 percent&amp;nbsp;of the faults found in industrial power distribution systems that reduced motor efficiency stemmed from problems within the power circuit. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Over the next six weeks, PdMA Corporationâs âDon't Forget Reliabilityâ six-tip series will explore the impact of each of the six fault zones on motor efficiency.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Concerns about power quality include elevated distortion or imbalance of voltage and current signals supplying the motor or motor drive. Left undetected, these issues can create elevations in winding temperature above acceptable levels, which can lead to a malfunction or shorten the motor's lifespan. At minimum this increased operating temperature, a product of inefficient harmonic rich power, reduces the system efficiency and wastes precious power.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Electric motor tip: Looking at coefficient of friction</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=justify&gt;Brushes are used to carry current from the DC power supply and the series windings to the commutator and armature circuit. They must be seated properly to allow for a low coefficient of friction and extended brush life. A high resistance at the brush surface may also result in an improper current density across the brushes. Normally the desired current density is 55-85 amps per square inch, however you should refer to the brush manufacturer for confirmation. Excessive current density will cause the commutator to run hot, blacken, and excessive brush wear will occur. If the current density is too low the commutator film will be removed, threading and sparking will occur, and brushes will wear rapidly often resulting in the need for a commutator resurfacing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is not a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, after an overhaul or a periodic cleaning, it is a good idea to take a look at the wear on your brushes. If seating is required, see &lt;A href="https://webmail.corp.noria.com/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1102748458719%26s=4679%26e=001JuFFFeGvNKDkmRj7MNV2VLQJNzSDgIVNzQC6rofIx0LDz7i79rjhFKAYEPVDlb7FBJnuTzlVwrHtqVMpAkqOznas-8Kn82QfimS1UCCV3gF7En-iOWHXaOUzEMpcR_G4IPBciVlrSyyeH3gZeKbWtg==" target=_blank&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Tip of the Week, January 2, 2008 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;for a detailed description of the process.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/kuC27WQtKK0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Motor guidance: Effects of post-repair testing on inductance</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Inductance measurements are often used for trending, troubleshooting and quality control testing of motor health. Once a motor is installed and running under the normal operating conditions of its parent application, an expected range of inductance can be acquired and used as a comparison to easily identify changes in the motor health. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Using inductance values for quality control or acceptance testing doesn't always offer the luxury of comparison data or running history as the motor has not been installed into an application. Instead, the motor has only the magnetic image or memory of the last test performed during and after the motor repair.&amp;nbsp;If the last test performed post repair is a single-phase test on a three-phase motor, the remaining magnetic image on the motor will represent a magnetic anomaly. Just as it should if you tested a three-phase motor in the field that was secured after a single-phase fault in the power supply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Electric motors tip: What is 'guaranteed efficiency'?</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Now that many more of us are looking at motor nameplate data, with emphasis on finding out what the efficiency is, what the heck is "Guaranteed Efficiency"?&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Guaranteed minimum is another efficiency that is sometimes noted on a nameplate. This value is determined from a mathematical relationship that assumes the worst efficiency of any motor in a batch â used to determine the average (nominal) value â could have losses as much as 20 percent higher than the average. As a result, each nominal efficiency value would have a corresponding minimum efficiency value. You can view these values in Table 12-8 in NEMA MG-1.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Remember,&amp;nbsp;when working with PdMA's Energy Cost Analysis program not to confuse this with the Full Load Efficiency.&amp;nbsp; You want to use Full Load Efficiency in the program for your analysis.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Electric motor tip: RIC tests and winding styles</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;While most users of the MCE test equipment are familiar with Lap Windings and Concentric Windings, there is a third style of winding that can cause some confusion when interpreting a RIC test.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;A Consequent Pole Winding is a three-phase AC induction motor winding that is concentric wound (coil inside of a coil), but it only utilizes half the coil groups of a Concentric Winding. Where a normal concentric four-pole winding will have twelve groups of coils (four poles x three phases), a consequent pole winding will only have six groups. While the turns per slot will remain the same, it requires less time at the winding machine grouping coils. In a concentric wound motor, the coils are connected in a manner that will result in having the coil polarity alternate with pole and every phase.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;For example in a Three-Phase, Four-Pole Motor:&lt;BR&gt;Where: CW= South pole (clockwise)&lt;BR&gt;CCW = North pole (counter-clockwise)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt"&gt;First Pole Group: A Phase - CW; B Phase - CCW; C Phase - CW &lt;BR&gt;Second Pole Group: A Phase -CCW; B Phase - CW; C Phase - CCW&lt;BR&gt;Third Pole Group: A Phase - CW; B Phase - CCW; C Phase - CW&lt;BR&gt;Fourth Pole Group: A Phase - CCW; B Phase - CW; C Phase - CCW&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In a Consequent Pole motor however, six coil groups are all connected to the same polarity. The consequential result of this connection is opposite magnetic poles, created in between the physical windings in the motor's stator. Thus six coil groups, creating twelve magnetic fields. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;Motor nameplate information does not tell the technician if they have a Consequent Pole Winding. When viewing the RIC test of a Consequent four-pole motor, it may appear that you are looking at a two-pole motor, seeing only a complete A, B, and C phase sinusoidal pattern through 180 degrees, instead of 90 degrees. Therefore, the technician needs to pay attention to the RIC graph displayed as they are performing the test. If at the end of 90 degrees on a four-pole machine you do not see a complete sign it is recommended to continue the test for at least an additional 90 degrees.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;For more information, visit &lt;A href="http://www.pdma.com"&gt;www.pdma.com&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/zdfVRWrK1Ic" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Industrial motor repair service firm to build facility in Phoenix</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Keller Electrical Industries Inc., the Southwest's leading service provider of industrial electrical motor repair services and a manufacturer, integrator and installer of custom industrial motor controls, announced on August 17 that they will be constructing a new state-of-the-art manufacturing and repair facility located on 8.7 acres in the central Phoenix area.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The new facility will house the company's corporate headquarters along with its manufacturing, repair, electrical engineering and design divisions, as well as a product distribution facility. The 105,000-square-foot facility will include 270 kilowatts (KW) of roof-top solar power generation that is expected to provide a significant portion of the company's energy consumption needs. The facility will have five individual industrial bridge cranes ranging in size from 7.5 tons up to 30 tons of lifting capacity along with numerous other industrial strength jib cranes throughout the facility to accommodate effective materials handling. The project will include the purchase of the most modern and technologically advanced motor repair, manufacturing, production and testing equipment available in the world.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;"We are extremely pleased to announce this exciting new chapter in our company's history," said Don Anderson, president and CEO of Keller Electrical Industries. "This is a real testament to the caliber of our people and quality of services they provide. We believe that this facility will provide our customers the absolute best class of goods and services available and is something they are requiring in order to differentiate themselves in today's marketplace." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;During the design and planning phase of this project, the company retained electrical industry veteran and industrial motor expert Austin Bonnett to consult with the company on the building layout and equipment selection to ensure that industry best practices and lean manufacturing principals were incorporated. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;"It has been a privilege to work with the Keller team on the design of this facility and to see our work product come to life," said Bonnett. "There has been a tremendous amount of effort and thought put into this project in order to give the Keller customers a superior offering. I've enjoyed many meaningful projects during the past fifty years of my career, but would have to say that this truly has been one of the most rewarding to date. Having had the opportunity to visit most of the major repair and manufacturing facilities in the country, I believe that the building design and the testing equipment offerings at this new site will make it one of the premier repair and manufacturing facilities of its kind west of the Mississippi, if not the entire country." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The construction services will be provided by Sun State Builders, Arizona's leading build-to-suit specialist, and ground breaking is expected in September of this year with final completion slated for July of 2010. The High Voltage project cost will be in excess of $16.0 million and is expected to add approximately 125 jobs to the Valley over the next five years.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Harmonizing international motor efficiency standards</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="http://www.iec.ch/"&gt;International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)&lt;/A&gt; recently passed standard IEC 60034-30 (2008), which defines energy-efficiency classes for single-speed, three-phase, and 50- and 60-hertz (Hz) induction motors. The standard is part of an effort to unify motor testing standards, efficiency requirements and product labeling requirements so that motor purchasers worldwide have the ability to easily recognize premium-efficiency products. Industrial energy managers responsible for offshore facilities and end-users purchasing replacements for failed IEC or metric motors that are imported with equipment packages should be aware of these new efficiency standards.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;The new full-load efficiency standards apply to most worldwide industrial continuous-duty motors with the following parameters:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Single-speed, three-phase, and 50 Hz and 60 Hz 
&lt;LI&gt;2, 4, and 6 poles (3,000; 1,500; and 1,000 RPM at 50 Hz) 
&lt;LI&gt;Rated output from 0.75 to 375 (1 to 500 horsepower) 
&lt;LI&gt;Rated voltage up to 1,000 volts 
&lt;LI&gt;Rated on the basis of either duty type S1 (continuous duty) or S3 (intermittent duty) with a rated cyclic duration factor of 80 percent or higher 
&lt;LI&gt;Capable of operating direct online. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The table below shows the new IEC 60034-30 (2008) efficiency classes and comparable efficiency levels.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;TABLE border=0 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width="100%"&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New International Efficiency (IE) Classes&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Efficiency Levels&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Comparison&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IE1&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Standard efficiency&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Efficiency levels comparable to the existing EFF2 in Europe&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IE2&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;High efficiency&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Efficiency levels comparable to the existing EFF1 in Europe and identical to the U.S. EPAct for 60 Hz&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IE3&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Premium efficiency&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD vAlign=top&gt;
&lt;P&gt;New efficiency class in Europe and identical to NEMA PremiumÂ® in the United States for 60 Hz&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The standard also reserves an IE4 class (Super Premium Efficiency) for the future. The following motors are excluded from the new efficiency standard:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Motors made solely for inverter operation 
&lt;LI&gt;Motors completely integrated into a machine (pump, fan or compressor) that cannot be tested separately from the machine. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For 60 Hz operation, the IE2 and IE3 minimum full-load efficiency values are virtually identical to the &lt;A href="http://www.nema.org/"&gt;North American National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)&lt;/A&gt; Energy Efficient and Premium Efficiency motor standards, respectively. (NEMA does specify different full-load efficiency values for motors with totally enclosed fan-cooled [TEFC] and open drip-proof enclosures.) The IEC minimum full-load efficiency standards are higher for 60 Hz motors than for 50 Hz motors. This is because as long as the motor torque is constant, I2R or winding resistance losses are the same at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. The motor output power, however, increases linearly with speed, increasing by 20 percent when the frequency is increased from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. In general, the 60 Hz efficiency is about 2.5 percent to 0.5 percent greater than the 50 Hz values. The efficiency gain is greater for smaller motor power ratings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG border=0 alt="This photo shows a motor in an industrial plant environment which is being measured by a person holding a square testing device with a screen. The testing device is connected to the motor by a cable." src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_mccoy_clip_01.jpg" width=249 height=290&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The new IEC 60034-30 motor efficiency standard could have major energy-saving impact for industrial motors worldwide.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Unifying Worldwide Efficiency Classifications&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;To show compliance with these new efficiency standards, motors must be tested in accordance with the newly adopted IEC 60034-2-1 testing protocol. This procedure provides test results that are largely compatible with those obtained by the North American IEEE 112B and CSA 390 test methods.&lt;BR&gt;The new standard also requires that the motor efficiency class and nominal motor efficiency be labeled on the motor nameplate and given in product literature and motor catalogs in the following format: &lt;STRONG&gt;IE3 94.5%&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;New Minimum Energy Performance Standards&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While the IEC sets guidelines for motor testing and efficiency classes, the organization does not regulate efficiency. With the new efficiency standards in place, the &lt;A href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/regulatory_committee_en.htm"&gt;European Commission Eco-design Regulatory Committee&lt;/A&gt; recommended in March 2009 that electric motors with an output power of 0.75 to 375 kilowatts (kW) equal or exceed new mandatory Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). The MEPS, expected to be adopted in June 2009, are set at the following levels:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;IE2 by June 16, 2011 
&lt;LI&gt;IE3 by January 1, 2015 (for motors &amp;gt;=7.5 kW, or IE2 with an adjustable-speed drive) 
&lt;LI&gt;IE3 for all motors by January 1, 2017 (or IE2 with an adjustable speed drive). &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The new MEPS will supersede the existing voluntary 1999 European Committee of Manufacturers of Electrical Machines and Power Electronics EFF1, EFF2, and EFF3 efficiency standards.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adoption of the MEPS by the European Commission will put them on a path similar to that taken by the United States in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 (&lt;A href="http://energy.senate.gov/public/_files/RL342941.pdf"&gt;PDF 151 KB&lt;/A&gt;). &lt;A href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/"&gt;Download Adobe Reader&lt;/A&gt;. This act increases the U.S. MEPS for 1- to 200-horsepower, 1,200, 1,800 and 3,600 RPM general-purpose motors from the Energy Policy Act of 1992 Energy Efficient (IE2 equivalent) levels to NEMA Premium Efficiency (IE3) levels by December 2010. EISA also establishes an Energy Efficient (IE2) level for motors with output power ratings of 201 to 500 hp.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Motor tip: Resistance imbalance change from baseline</title>
            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;It is not unusual to see a large three-phase induction motor with phase resistance perfectly or closely balanced with an imbalance calculating well below 0.1 percent. With this kind of manufacturing precision, the balance of resistance measurement can be a very sensitive indicator of a changing condition in the motor windings or circuit. Although we direct your attention more to inductance and impedance for identifying winding degradation, strong consideration should be given to establishing a change from baseline caution and alarm set point for balance of resistance. The recommended change from baseline alarm set points are caution at a 50 percent increase and alarm at a 100 percent increase.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Here is an example of the importance of establishing these alarm levels. A motor tests at baseline with a .1 percent balance of resistance. Two years later the balance of resistance test in the field was 1.5 percent. A balance of resistance of 1.5 percent is not in excess of previous alarm set points and may not seem too high. However, when compared to the baseline it is over a 1000 percent increase and immediately needs to be investigated further.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/uJx5jv4Hy0E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;The Phasor diagram, a 360-degree protractor, displays voltages and currents so the operator can verify the vectors (angles) of the voltages and currents relative to each other. In a three-phase VAC circuit, voltages should be separated from each other by 120 degrees, i.e., when voltage one is at 0 degrees, either voltage 2 or 3 will be at 120 degrees and the remaining one at 240. For an AC induction motor, current lags the voltage. The amount of lag will decrease as load is applied to the motor. The angle between the voltage and its associated current is the power factor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Regardless of whether the operator selects a Phase Sequence of clockwise or counter clockwise, current should lag behind the associated voltage on the Phasor Diagram. For example, with Voltage "A" at 120 degrees, current "A" will always be a value less than 120 and above 0 degrees on the Phasor Diagram.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;Use of the Phasor Diagram immediately after a Power Analysis capture allows the operator to verify the installation of their voltage clips and clamp-on current probes. The selection of clockwise or counter clockwise Phase Sequence only establishes which of voltages 2 or 3 will be labeled at 120 degrees with the other at 240 degrees. Voltage 1 will always be at zero degrees. Do not allow a clockwise or counter clockwise Phase Sequence arrow to influence how you look at the Phasor Diagram. The arrows do not indicate on "which side of the voltage" you are expected to see the current.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9pt"&gt;If a current is not where you expect it to be, take a deep breath and relax. If it is 180 degrees out of where you expected, you may use the software corrections to invert it and next time you will make sure the arrow on the current probe is pointing towards the load. If two of the currents are lagging the wrong voltages, you can even swap the currents again using the software's correction options without having to reach into the controller.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/s5ip1Lcb_bQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

They commonly result in elevated 2x line frequency vibration and may first show up on EMAX testing through increased eccentricity frequencies. MCE testing may not show early indications as there are no continuity issues on the rotor cage. If left unattended, chipping and/or shorting of the rotor laminations may occur. Excessive movement may increase chances of cracks or breaks on the end ring. Swaging (press indent of rotor bars to tighten fit) is a common corrective measure before rebarring. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Tech tip: External resistor banks for wound rotor motors</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Last week, PdMA reinforced the need to isolate the wound rotor from the external resistor bank to properly test its resistance to the shaft in order to help prevent flash over in the vicinity of the slip rings. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Many technicians simply lift the brushes to accomplish this isolation from the external resistor bank. That would be an excellent time to verify the condition of the external resistor bank and the multiple contactors used to change the rotor's circuit resistance. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;In some applications, there can be several "stepped" resistance settings allowing for speed control of the wound rotor motor (WRM). Performing an MCE Standard test on the resistor bank for each of these stepped resistance settings allows you to easily verify the condition of the contacts in the circuit. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;For each set of contacts cutting in additional resistance, the three-phase resistive imbalance should be below 1.0 percent. Any readings greater than 1.0 percent should be investigated by inspecting the contact surfaces for proper seating, pitting, cracking and operation. Any resistive imbalance in the external resistor bank will result in uneven currents through the rotor windings during operation and affect the performance of the motor. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don't forget while checking the phase-to-phase resistances of the external resistor bank to ensure it also has satisfactory resistance-to-ground values.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/Z28bww3NdwI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tech tip: Flash over on wound rotor motor slip rings</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Preventing flash over on a Wound Rotor Motor's (WRM) slip rings requires periodic inspection and testing of the rotor's insulation system. The point of the rotor's lowest insulation resistance on a WRM's rotor circuit will almost always be between the exposed metal surface of the slip ring and the rotor shaft. Looking at the typical installation of a WRM it is easy to understand how dirt, carbon dust, and other forms of contamination can build up in the area of the slip rings. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;During start-up the high slip between the rotor and the synchronous magnetic field of the stator induces a large amount of energy in the rotor's windings. Lowered insulation resistance due to contamination build up around the rotor leads could easily lead to flash over (arcing between the rings or to ground) and damage the connections between the lead and the rings, the slip rings and possibly even the shaft. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regular testing of the rotor circuit separate from the resistor bank is recommended to maintain a high level of dependability. Ensure your MCE green ground lead is connected to the shaft of the rotor, if possible, to get the most accurate measurement of the resistance between the windings and the shaft of the rotor. While you are at it ensure you closely inspect the slip rings and their insulation for any build up of contamination and clean if necessary.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/CCF1hX0hU7Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Electric Motors Corporation to build in Indiana</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, along with a team of state, county and city officials, announced May 14 that Electric Motors Corporation (EMC) of Camarillo, Calif., manufacturers of electric drive system technologies, will be partnering with Gulf Stream Coach of Nappanee, Ind., to launch electric vehicle production facilities potentially creating an estimated 1,600 jobs by 2012.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;EMC has partnered with RV manufacturer, Gulf Stream Coach, to produce the first light-duty electric pickup truck. Together, the companies plan to invest more than $80 million on building renovations, machinery and equipment to site manufacturing facilities in Wakarusa and Nappanee. EMC plans to hire 450 associates by 2012 to produce and assemble electric motors. Gulf Stream Coach hopes to recall displaced employees that could add up to 1,200 associates to its current workforce within the same timeframe.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;"You can't keep a great workforce and a great business environment down for long," said Daniels. "Every trip starts with a single step, but this is a huge step on the way back to the prosperity we've always associated with Elkhart County."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;"Electric Motors Corporation is proud to work closely with the EDC of Elkhart County and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation to help attract other new manufacturers to Elkhart County. These companies will provide the advanced component systems we need, such as permanent magnet electric motors, power electronics, and small fuel efficient gasoline and bio-fuel internal combustion engine technologies, for the future growth of the electric vehicle industry in Elkhart County," stated CEO of EMC, Wil Cashen.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;Cashen added that the decision to expand EMC's light to medium-duty truck operations into Elkhart County was based on their proximity to one of the largest concentrations of motor home, commercial panel truck and ambulance vehicle manufacturers in North America.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;President of Gulf Stream Coach, Brian Shea, briefly stated, "We appreciate the efforts of our state and local officials to get employment restarted here in our community. This is an excellent opportunity to bring in new technologies to provide for future growth. We look forward to working with Wil Cashen and EMC on the hybrid electrification of light- duty pickup trucks."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;The first contact by EMC to Elkhart County, Indiana was with Wakarusa Town Manager Tom Roeder in February of 2009, "We worked with EMC to introduce them to area companies that could partner with their hybrid technologies. We quickly realized that EMC was just the company to help put our people back to work," said Roeder.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;Mayor of Nappanee, Larry Thompson, also played an integral role in the attraction efforts of EMC. "This was an opportunity for two communities to come together during these economic hard times. That was the driving force that brought us together to bring jobs back to our area and help our families," he concluded.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;President of the EDC of Elkhart County, Dorinda Heiden-Guss, elaborated on the synergy between this new manufacturing cluster and the existing manufacturing base in Elkhart County, Indiana.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','serif'"&gt;"EMC's expansion to Elkhart County and its partnership with Gulf Stream Coach is a perfect fit. The combination of our automotive, truck component, RV and commercial utility vehicle industries with the electric power drive systems for electric vehicles could have a profound effect on our entire region," she said.

            <title>Diagnosing broken rotor bars in a two-pole motor</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Florida Power &amp;amp; Light Company (FPL) is an electric utility company based in Juno Beach, Fla. During routine EMAX testing in June 2003, motor engineer Enrique Rodriguez observed that the peak level of the pole pass sideband in a 4,160-volt, 3,500-horsepower, 3,590 rpm AC induction motor was 0.7419, which exceeded the alarm set point of 0.3 (Figure 1). Rotor bar problems were suspected; however when vibration analysis was performed, the results indicated a healthy motor. Due to the conflicting indications between the EMAX and vibration tests, the decision was made to monitor the motor and trend the test results.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=302 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_PDMA_clip_image002.gif" width=386&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Action Taken&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The motor was retested periodically until May 12, 2004. At that time, it was removed from service. The trended data indicated a 1,420 percent increase in the peak level of the pole pass sideband from 0.1814 at a running speed of 3591 on August 15, 2001 to 2.5851 at a running speed of 3592 on May 12, 2004 &amp;nbsp;(Figure 2).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=313 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_PDMA_clip_image004.gif" width=386&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Trending the data from tests taken between 2001 and 2004 showed an exponential increase in the pole pass peak levels, which is typically indicative of at least one or more broken rotor bars.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Additionally, there was a 275 percent increase in the load variation, from 0.855 percent in 2001 to 2.345 percent on May 12, 2004 (Figure 2). The load variation should be constant from test to test under normal operating and motor conditions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Current Spectrum (Figure 3) of test data taken on May 12, 2004 showed an increase in sideband activity around the fundamental frequency, which also indicated broken rotor bars.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=350 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_PDMA_clip_image006.gif" width=361&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All EMAX test results indicated broken rotor bars in the motor. The motor was pulled and a RIC test was performed, which also indicated a rotor anomaly (Figure 4). The motor was sent to the motor shop, where it was disassembled. A visual inspection found 22 of 51 rotor bars were broken or cracked (See Figure 5).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=390 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_PDMA_clip_image008.gif" width=624&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=174 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_PDMA_clip_image010.gif" width=265&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Root Cause&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It was determined that bad braze joints between the bars and end rings from a rotor repair performed in 2001 caused the broken and cracked rotor bars.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Savings&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A catastrophic failure of this motor would have resulted in a more expensive repair and the high costs associated with an unplanned outage. The progressive approach taken by FP&amp;amp;L utilizing predictive technologies resulted in substantial savings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Follow-up&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Enrique has continued to use this testing approach on all the Boiler Feed Pump (BFP) motors in the Florida Power &amp;amp; Light system, with very good success. Every year, motors with potential rotor issues are identified after running the PdMA EMAX Motor Current Signature Analysis testing, thus avoiding costly down time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This article was provided by PdMA Corporation.

            <title>Electric motor testing tip: Check your connections</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'"&gt;When performing an offline test on a motor, it is very important to verify that all connections have a proper contact. If you connect a test lead to a motor lead terminal, you must ensure there is good contact between the jaws of the lead and the terminal. These connections are often covered with debris, oil, dirt, etc. In other cases, the testing location is covered in insulating material which must be removed prior to testing. Insulating material that has been removed can often leave residue, such as glue residue, behind that is not visible. A good practice is to always thoroughly clean the spot where the test leads will be connected.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The MCE&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt;MAX&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"&gt; Tester includes a Test Lead Check that verifies proper connectivity of the tester to the motor lead or terminal. The lead check is performed before and after every AC Standard Test and periodically throughout the RIC test. This ensures proper connectivity and the most accurate test results possible. If there is a poor metal to metal contact between the tester leads and the testing spot, the software will alert you of the exact phase that needs attention.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/SkRVDl1aS8I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Desiccant keeps moisture out of your electric motors</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;A desiccant is a substance that induces or sustains a state of dryness in its local area, in a moderately sealed container. It is used to trap moisture from the air, thereby maintaining humidity levels in a container. So, if you have an electrical enclosure (distribution box, breaker panel, junction box, etc.), located in a high humidity area, you may want to think about using one.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;If you decide to use a desiccant, it should be placed within a closed moisture barrier or sealed container. This allows the desiccant to absorb the trapped moisture vapor inside the enclosure; therefore, it is recommended that you have well maintained gaskets on the enclosures. A Humidity Indicating Card can be placed inside the enclosure to show humidity levels and indicate when the desiccant needs to be replaced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;To determine the type and quantity of desiccant to use, you must know the type of container/enclosure you are going to place it in and calculate the volume or area of the enclosure. Select the type of desiccant to fit the application based on the amount of moisture to be absorbed, temperature, and humidity of the space. Also, make sure to check the integrity of the gaskets of your enclosure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/xkY-fpKrZEI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Motor tip: The effect of surge arrestors on motor RTG</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Many large critical motors have surge arrestors installed to prevent voltage transients from damaging the motor insulation. Some of these arrestors will have a breakdown voltage within the 5-kilovolt (kV) range of the MCEMAX test equipment. An example is a 4kV motor with surge arrestors that start conducting at a ground wall voltage of 3.7kV. If you have the MCE test voltage set at 5kV for a standard test or polarization index (PI), you will push the surge arrestor beyond its breakdown voltage and see a very low resistance-to-ground (RTG) value. If you want to verify the breakdown voltage, run a step voltage test. Once the breakdown voltage is reached you will see a dramatic drop in RTG or an increase in current flow through the insulation. All tests after that should be performed at a voltage less than the breakdown voltage, which will allow valid insulation testing of the ground wall without showing the arrestors as a parallel resistance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/Cok6TllMQEs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

Motor efficiency often only varies 1 to 2 percent&amp;nbsp;between no load and full load. This is an often overlooked detail in cost analysis. A 100-horsepower motor supplying a 60-horsepower application may still run within 2 percent&amp;nbsp;of its designed efficiency. The right approach is to compare the power required to deliver 60&amp;nbsp;horsepower from a 100-horsepower motor operating at the low end of its efficiency range vs. the power required to deliver 60 horsepower from a 60-horsepower motor operating at the top of its efficiency range."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/1_EBk_dknyY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

Now is the time to find the bad actors in your motor population that are costing your company money. Many facilities are applying the basic reliability principles toward saving money by identifying motor defects early so they can be fixed timely and at a low cost. Reducing repair costs and increasing uptime for the process is a must. However, there are other hidden costs that can be identified through a cost analysis of your existing motor assets. Using a cost analysis approach, you can replace motors with poor efficiency or reduce the size of a motor that is too large for its application. However, be careful that the historical operating parameters and performance are key variables in your decision. Just replacing a motor with nameplate to nameplate comparisons may result in money lost rather than money saved. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Most electric motor efficiency efforts and attention to date have only focused on about 10 percent of the total electric motor population: those motors of one horsepower (746 watts) or greater.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

"This brief report identifies the scope of the problem and offers some practical application solutions that can help&amp;nbsp;not only gearmotor specifying engineers, but&amp;nbsp;users as well."&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

To compound matters, the USDOE estimates&amp;nbsp;only 12 percent of users consider the benefits of lower energy operating costs&amp;nbsp;for more efficient electric&amp;nbsp;motor systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Millions more small motors and gearmotors are found in thousands of commercial and industrial applications involving pumping, dispensing, cooling, conveying, mixing and every facet of automation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Section 10 - Recommended Practices for Individual Consumers discusses voltage and current distortion limits. These limits are applied to the point of common coupling (PCC), which is the point between the non-linear load and other loads within an industrial plant. For a utility company the PCC is the consumer-utility interface. Maintaining compliance to the harmonic limits at the plant level PCC should ensure that the utility PCC does not exceed the limits specified in Table 10-2-Low-Voltage System Classification and Distortion Limits. The general system limit for Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is 5 percent and the general system limit for notch depth is 20 percent.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

There are a few very often mentioned standards like the IEEE43 and IEEE95. However, there are other applicable standards worth knowing about where the MCEMAX technology can be utilized to assist in verifying motor acceptability to the standard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The IEEE 400-2001 is the Guide for Field Testing and Evaluation of the Insulation of Shielded Power Cable Systems. Section 5 - Direct Voltage Testing, discusses low voltage DC testing (LVDC) as tests performed at or below 5000 volts. In this standard the most common LVDC insulation test for shielded power cables is the polarization index test method. The rationale for using DC voltage test equipment is primarily based on the size and power requirements being so excessive for AC voltage test equipment. However, following are abbreviated advantages of performing acceptance and maintenance tests of shielded cables using DC test voltage:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;A name=LETTER.BLOCK7&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;When performing power analysis testing on medium- or high-voltage motors, many companies have installed some form of test access panel for efficiency and safety purposes in compliance with the NFPA 70E. They commonly acquire voltage from the secondary of the power transformer (PT) and use that same voltage signal for all tests taken on each of the motor starters connected to that MCC. However, the acquired current signals are taken independent from each starter. A frequently asked question is whether or not the single access point for voltage is sufficient for all the starters on the MCC. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Tips for good commutation in your DC motors</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;DC motors are very ruggedly designed machines. However, they can be pretty fickle sometimes, especially when it comes to brush wear. To get maximum life out of your brushes and maintain good DC commutation, the following is recommended:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Good commutator roundness:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt; If the commutator is not round, this increases the chances of increased brush wear on the machine, as well as an increase in arcing and sparking of the commutator thereby destroying the commutator surface.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Uniform brush pressure:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt; Correct brush pressure ensures that the brushes last until their estimated life. This also helps to avoid commutator damage by grooving or slotting of the commutator surface.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Good seating of the brushes to the commutator surface:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt; Again, this is to avoid damaging the commutator surface and prevent damage. Also, minimizes the chance of arcing and sparking of the commutator and helps maintain a good commutator film.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt;Proper undercutting of the Mica insulation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin"&gt; The less Mica undercutting there is, the harder the brush type that you have to use. Harder brushes do not last anywhere near as long as a softer brush in the same system.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/Gu2X_UmrZyo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New motor technologies boost system efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Electric motors in U.S. industrial applications account for more than 60 percent of electricity use; even small increases in efficiency improvements can make a big difference in energy savings. Two new motor technologies now available commercially offer breakthrough efficiency and reliability opportunities for industry.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=187 alt="Photo of the inside of an AC motor assembly showing a rotor that is manufactured with copper." src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_US_clip_image001.jpg" width=247&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The copper rotor motor technology offers high efficiency, performance, and reliability.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Copper Rotor Motors are âUltra-Efficientâ&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A new line of motors featuring the copper rotor motor technology has entered the U.S. industrial market, providing significant energy savings potential for manufacturers. &lt;U&gt;Siemens Energy &amp;amp; Automationâs &lt;/U&gt;induction AC motors include die-cast copper rotors which offer increased electrical energy efficiency, lower operating temperature, extended motor life, and reduced weight and size. In fact, these ultra-efficient motor designs have total losses that are 6.6 to 15.5 percent below those of comparable NEMA Premium efficiency motors while exceeding the NEMA Premium full-load efficiency standards by up to 1.4 percent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The die-cast &lt;A href="http://www.copper-motor-rotor.org/"&gt;copper rotor motor&lt;/A&gt; technology is the result of several years of research and development by both the &lt;A href="http://www.copper.org/"&gt;Copper Development Association Inc.&lt;/A&gt; (CDA) and Siemens to achieve superior efficiency by substituting copper for aluminum in the squirrel cage induction motor. CDA led the way on manufacturing processes and high-temperature mold materials to enable cost-effective production of copper rotor motors. The Siemens project team developed design methods and conducted an extensive modeling program to optimize the motor for the high conductivity copper rotor. The result is a motor technology that offers high efficiency, performance and reliability. According to the CDA, in the United States alone, a 1 percent increase in motor efficiency could save 20 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, or $1.4 billion in electricity (at 7 cents per kWh).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Siemens was instrumental in bringing the technology to the commercial market. The company incorporated the high-conductivity copper rotors into their motors, which include aluminum and cast-iron frame models. Other improvements include optimized rotor and stator design, low-friction bearings, redesigned cooling system, polyurea-based grease, dynamically balanced rotors and precision-machined mating surfaces for reduced vibration. Specially designed insulation enables use with variable speed drives. The new line of motors is available up to 20 horsepower.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Motor Controller Increases Efficiency and Improves Comfort&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A new technology for variable speed control of single-phase AC induction motors in HVAC fan systems provides a low-cost, energy-efficient solution for indoor climate comfort and noise reduction. The Adaptive Climate Controller from &lt;A href="http://www.ogd3.com/home02.html"&gt;Opto Generic Devices V-HVAC Inc.&lt;/A&gt; uses multiple, closed-loop signals, analog optical-based control, and sensor input to deliver climate and moisture control, healthy air quality, and proven electricity savings of 30 to 50 percent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With help from DOEâs Industrial Technologies Program &lt;A href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/inventions/"&gt;Inventions &amp;amp; Innovations&lt;/A&gt; program, Opto Generic Devices (OGD) Inc. created an optical programmable encoder and controller combination that offers:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Continually adaptive/variable speed 
&lt;LI&gt;Optimized commutation 
&lt;LI&gt;Dynamic vector control 
&lt;LI&gt;Real-time feedback 
&lt;LI&gt;Application tuning 
&lt;LI&gt;Signal enhancement for operating AC motors &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Based on this technology, OGDâs subsidiary, OGD V-HVAC, developed the Adaptive Climate Controller (ACC) (&lt;A href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/inventions/pdfs/optogeneric.pdf"&gt;PDF 399 KB&lt;/A&gt;) (&lt;A href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"&gt;Download Adobe Reader&lt;/A&gt;). This unique technology is an alternative to digital controllers that can be complex, expensive, and can cause motors to run hot and generate noise. This intelligent and adaptive controller maintains temperature for the human comfort zone by gently mixing room air depending on needs of the space. By gradually ramping up fan speeds, energy is conserved by using only the electrical and thermal energy necessary to satisfy the demand. In addition, noise from electrical, motor and air flow is reduced.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ACC technology was commercialized in 2005 and has sold more than 2,500 units. Projected annual energy savings from the technology is 2.9 million Btu of electricity per 5,000 units.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;The engineers' advances also hold promise in technologies for health care (micropumps for implantable medical devices) and first responders (bio-chemical sensors).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;"For the first time, we have achieved a level of miniaturization for machines like that achieved over the last decades in electronics," said Ghodssi, Herbert Rabin Distinguished Associate Professor of Engineering in the Clark School's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Systems Research. "Our work shows that it is feasible to manufacture and integrate reliable, robust micromachines that apply tiny pumps, motors, and turbines in ways never before possible."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;The central component of their research is the lowly ball bearing, an ancient technology now used in everything from jet engines to dentists' drills -- devices in which parts move at high speeds in close proximity to each other. Ball bearings are simply spheres made of metal, silicon, or other substances that when placed between two surfaces, such as the components of a motor or generator, allow those components to move with less friction and heat than if they were moving in direct contact with each other. The less friction and heat, the faster the components can spin and the more power they can produce.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Using well-known manufacturing techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor industry to make computer chips, the Clark School researchers have successfully miniaturized ball bearing support mechanisms with microballs as wide as a few human hairs and nearly invisible to the naked eye. Using these components, they have built tiny silicon pumps, motors, and turbines demonstrating rotational speeds of up to 87,000 rpm, comparable to the speed of large-scale machinery.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;For troops on the battlefield, small-scale combustion generators using such micromachines, and combined with batteries in hybrid technologies, will significantly reduce the soldier's load. States Bruce Geil, acting branch chief for the Power Components Branch of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, "The Army needs small-scale, liquid-fueled power generators that can provide higher energy, at lighter weight and lower cost, than current fielded power sources. Dr. Ghodssi's team is developing key fuel delivery and electrical generator components to meet our requirements."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;Micromachine systems also will help power land or air-based "micro vehicles" (also under development at the Clark School in partnership with government agencies) that will venture into risk-filled environments ahead of soldiers or first responders and send back information. Microgenerators fabricated completely in silicon and supported on microball bearings could power the vehicles' electrical systems without weighing them down.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;To create their machines, Ghodssi and his team first had to conquer the science of microscale "tribology" or the friction, wear, and lubrication of tiny rolling components. They then applied this knowledge in building different types of micromachines using conventional manufacturing processes, and finally in integrating these devices into tiny systems that can reliably accomplish a task such as power generation over a reasonable period of time, and not simply burn up.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"&gt;"Rather than focus on an arbitrary performance specification for micromachines," says Ghodssi, "we focused on feasibility--building pumps and motors that are fast enough to do the jobs required, reliable enough to last, and easy enough to manufacture in the real world. As in the miniaturization of electronics, we expect to achieve successive generations of higher and higher efficiency and refinement in micromachine systems, and to see the creation not only of new defense and medical products, but of entirely new technologies no one has yet imagined."&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Motor system reliability impacts the bottom line</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Facing rising energy costs, corporate fiscal concerns and global competitiveness, more and more U.S. companies and utilities are focusing on the leading reliability and maintenance improvement opportunity in industrial facilities: electric motors. A sound reliability-centered motor maintenance program can help manufacturers achieve significant energy and cost savings. This article outlines steps to help you implement a program at your company.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=198 alt="Photo of a man crouching next to a red electric motor and taking notes on a notepad." src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Motor_clip_image001.jpg" width=247&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Establish a motor maintenance management plan to save energy and costs.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Why Consider Motor System Management?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since the 1990s, a variety of motor management program ideas have been presented to industry. Many of these programs are actually âenergy-efficient electric motor retrofit-or-repair-versus-replaceâ ideas, and they represent only a small portion of all the opportunities for managing electric motor systems. Preventive and condition-based maintenance, and other motor system management techniques, are often left out of such programs, creating a narrow view of the overall system. A complete motor maintenance curriculum considers all aspects of the motor system, including energy, environment, life-cycle costs, and a robust reliability and maintenance (R&amp;amp;M) program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A survey of motor decision-makers found that more than 70 percent emphasize reliability as the first consideration of their motor programs (see Figure 1). Even in the current environment, which stresses energy efficiency, the first priority for a plant in a reactive failure condition is getting equipment back online and in production. More than 60 percent of companies are operating their R&amp;amp;M practices in a reactive mode, so energy policies related to manufacturing and support equipment have become secondary. However, with a proactive R&amp;amp;M program in place, companies can improve energy efficiency and extend the life of the equipment, boosting the bottom line.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=227 alt="Figure 1 is titled 'Survey of Motor Decision Considerations' and shows a pie-chart graphic with portions divided up as follows â reliability 70%; production 16%; trouble-shooting 7%; other 4%; energy 3%." src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Motor_clip_image002.jpg" width=400&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1. Survey of Motor Decision Considerations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Source: H. Penrose,&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt; Electrical Motor Diagnostics and Motor Health Study &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(2003).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The impact of a full reliability-centered maintenance and management (RCMM) program for motor systems is multifold. In the United States alone, approximately $1.2 trillion is invested annually in maintenance programs; up to $750 billion of that amount is the direct result of poor R&amp;amp;M practices. An additional $2.5 trillion in potential business opportunities is lost per year as a direct result of poor R&amp;amp;M practices, or 20 percent of the annual U.S. gross domestic product. A majority of these are industrial motor systems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Moreover, motor system maintenance and management provide significant opportunities for improving energy efficiency and productivity. The U.S. Department of Energyâs &lt;EM&gt;United States Industrial Electric Motor System Market Opportunity Assessment &lt;/EM&gt;(&lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/pdfs/mtrmkt.pdf"&gt;PDF 6.6 MB&lt;/A&gt;) states, âIn 1994, electric motor-driven systems used in industrial processes consumed 679 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) â 23 percent of all electricity sold in the United States. Implementation of all well-established motor system energy efficiency measures and practices that meet reasonable investment criteria will yield annual energy savings of 75 to 122 billion kWh, with a value of $3.6 to $5.8 billionâ and an equivalent reduction of 74 megatons of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the &lt;EM&gt;E-Source DrivePower Atlas&lt;/EM&gt; at &lt;A href="http://www.esource.com/"&gt;www.esource.com&lt;/A&gt; reports that, âThe efficiencies of mechanical equipment, in general, can be increased typically 10 percent to 15 percent by proper maintenance.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A Reliability-Centered Motor Management Program&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To begin developing a reliability-centered motor management (RCMM) program, first identify the equipment that will be included in the program. Figure 2 shows an overview of the program, which begins with a &lt;STRONG&gt;facility asset census&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Set up a pilot area for developing the program, and expand the program incrementally to ensure its success.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=271 alt="Figure 2 is titled 'The RCMM Map' and depicts a flowchart graphic with seven boxes. A single box at the top of the chart marks the beginning of the flow and is labeled 'Facility Asset Census.' An arrow points downward from that box to another box directly underneath which reads 'Critical Equipment List.' At this point, the flowchart divides into two sections, with an arrow leading to a box on the right and one on the left. The box on the left is labeled 'Preventive Maintenance and ConditionâBased Maintenance Practices.' The box on the right is labeled 'Equipment Condition Assessment.' There is also an arrow running horizontally between these two boxes. Then, arrows go from each of these boxes and join in the center at one box below titled 'Maintenance Effectiveness Review.' There are two additional boxes, one on either side of the center box. Ths box on the left is labeled 'Best Practices' and is linked to with an arrow from the 'Preventive Maintenance and ConditionâBased Maintenance Practices' box above. The box on the right is labeled 'Root Cause Analysis' and is linked to with an arrow from the 'Equipment Condition Assessment' box. The 'Root Cause Analysis' box also has a curvy arrow pointing to the 'Maintenance Effectiveness Review' box in the center." src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_Motor_clip_image003.jpg" width=400 border=0&gt; &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Working environment, marketing/sales considerations, equipment&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; deemed important by the organization.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Perform an &lt;STRONG&gt;equipment condition assessment&lt;/STRONG&gt; in parallel with a &lt;STRONG&gt;preventive maintenance optimization &lt;/STRONG&gt;and development of &lt;STRONG&gt;condition-based maintenance&lt;/STRONG&gt; practices. In an equipment condition assessment, critical equipment is evaluated through tests and inspections such as those used in Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Keep results on record, and repair or replace equipment that is in poor condition; significant energy improvements can be considered at this time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The preventive maintenance optimization process can be as simple as reviewing existing processes to eliminate redundancies or as complex as advanced commercial preventive maintenance optimization processes. In almost every case, from one-third to two-thirds of existing planned maintenance procedures can be eliminated or combined. Compare the remaining preventive maintenance tasks to the results of a condition-based maintenance review, which determines when to perform corrective maintenance to maximize equipment and component life. This involves processes such as RCM or a &lt;STRONG&gt;maintenance effectiveness review&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A maintenance effectiveness review evaluates the testing that is currently being performed and compares that to the failure rate and modes of the equipment. If failure rate and modes exist and are as high as (or higher than) they were before the application of condition-based maintenance, consider improving the program. The process also provides an opportunity to decrease maintenance and identify new inspections, tests, or processes. Conduct a maintenance effectiveness review periodically; the equipment included in this review is usually selected by an experienced RCM analyst.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;root-cause analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; procedures and train personnel in their application. Internal or external facilitation can aid teams in using more rigorous processes. In addition, consider applying other process-based best practices, such as the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Motor Repair vs. Replace Decision-Making &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Motor Repair Specifications &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lubrication &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Storage &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System Energy Improvements: These include right-sizing and using variable-frequency drives (VFDs). In addition, use ITP software tools such as &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/software.html#mm"&gt;MotorMaster+&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/software.html#air"&gt;AirMaster+&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/software.html#psat"&gt;Pumping System Assessment Tool&lt;/A&gt; (PSAT), and &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/software.html#fsat"&gt;Fan System Assessment Tool&lt;/A&gt; (FSAT) to optimize motor-driven systems. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All of the findings and feedback support each of the other parts of the overall RCMM program map.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Key Performance Indicators&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When applying an RCMM program, consider the appropriate best practices and a method of measuring the application of the program. Maintenance managers should develop a series of key performance indicators that relate to the programâs components. The details of each component within the key performance indicators depend on the company and its goals. Be sure to consider the following key performance indicators.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Electrical Maintenance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A solid electrical maintenance program must be in place for a program to succeed. At a minimum, consider the following components:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Documentation and drawings of critical equipment &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;General electrical maintenance practices &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Arc flash and personal protective equipment program &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A review of load and power quality of critical equipment &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An active electrical root-cause analysis program &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Electrical safe work practices and corporate safety program &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An emergency repair plan for critical equipment. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Motor and Driven Equipment Selection Program:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Outline a process for the selection and specification of components for the motor system, including right-sizing, selection of controls and VFDs, and optimal selection of driven equipment for the complete motor system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Commissioning:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Inspect and test new and repaired equipment before application or storage. This ensures the reliability of the component and that changes have not been made that may reduce the componentâs energy efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Operations and maintenance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This includes repair vs. replace decision-making, maintenance training, failure analysis, testing technologies, lubrication, and inspections.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Electric motor system repair:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Repair processes, procedures, and specifications, including the qualifications of the repair shop for specific equipment types and sizes. The primary purpose is to ensure reliability or energy efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant inventory and records:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Motor system components in operation and maintained as spares; includes storage procedures and processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Utility management:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the energy efficiency component of motor management programs. It should include selecting motor systems for evaluation for immediate energy improvement opportunities within the companyâs financial constraints. For assistance, use the technical resources for &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/techpubs_motors.html"&gt;fan, pump, motor&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/techpubs_compressed_air.html"&gt;compressed air&lt;/A&gt; systems on DOE's &lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/"&gt;Industrial Technologies Program&lt;/A&gt; Web site.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Reliability-Centered Motor Management Team&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Select a team to develop the RCMM program and to be involved in the RCM and maintenance effectiveness review processes. Include both in-house and external stakeholders in the motor management program, such as these:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;R&amp;amp;M managers &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;R&amp;amp;M technicians &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Utility or energy managers &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Purchasing &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Operations managers &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Information technology specialists &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Associated vendors &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Others, as necessary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is important for this team to meet regularly, such as once a month, after the program begins. As the program matures, team meetings could be held quarterly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Case Study: Automotive Transmission Manufacturer&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A good example of this kind of program is taking place in Indiana. An Indianapolis-based transmission manufacturer has been implementing a motor management program since 2001, focusing on condition-based inspection, testing, vendor storage, motor repair practices, and root-cause analysis. The RCMM team consists of internal personnel and skilled tradespersons as well as a contracted electric motor repair facility. At the monthly team meetings, the repair facility reports volume and repair cost reductions and makes recommendations for improving the reliability of motors that have been repaired. The internal tradespersons conduct root-cause analyses and ârepetitive failure analysesâ that include investigations of instances in which equipment fails more than once in a given period.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When initial testing and inspection began, the programâs repair and replacement costs increased as equipment with poor levels of reliability were identified and corrected. Once the dust settled, staff determined that there were 720 average repair-or-replace decisions per year affecting electric motors. Focusing on just three of the seven key performance indicators, they reduced the number of repair-or-replace decisions to slightly more than 120 per year, the majority being minor repairs. The impact on overall equipment availability has been measurable, and the cost per unit manufactured has dropped significantly.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Warranty Recovery Opportunities&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most companies forget to investigate warranty recovery opportunities in failed equipment. The average motor repair vendor warranty is one year; however, many repair shops increase their competitiveness by offering warranties as high as five years. New, premium efficient, electric motors have warranties ranging from five to seven years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One reason that both new and repair facilities are willing to offer these warranties for motors is that many companies do not track warranty opportunities. In a large number of facilities, the missed opportunities add up not to thousands of dollars but to hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in unclaimed warranties. It is a good idea to track warranty dates in computerized maintenance and management system programs or using third-party software to gain quick access to records; this ensures that your company is taking full advantage of warranty opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Final Considerations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A growing number of utilities and industrial companies are focusing on the number one R&amp;amp;M improvement opportunity: electric motors. These companies find that improving electric motor systems through partnerships, equipment storage, best motor management practices, repair standards, and robust maintenance programs have reduced overall energy use and increased competitiveness and profitability.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this time of rising energy costs, corporate fiscal issues, and the need to improve competitiveness and capacity, establishing a motor system maintenance management program can be one of the most substantial improvements a company can make. The best time to start is now.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Lesson learned on electric motor shaft</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Reliability in Action department features case studies submitted by our readers. To have your article considered for inclusion in a future issue, e-mail it to parnold@noria.com. Readers who have their article published will receive a Reliable Plant T-shirt. Here is this issue's submission:&lt;/I&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A 750-horsepower motor for a power station air compressor was sent to the motor shop for a winding failure. It was refurbished and returned to the station. Plant personnel performed a precision alignment of the motor to the compressor, yet high vibration was found on the initial startup. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Alignment tolerances were reviewed, soft foot conditions were minimized, and motor mounting and support adjustments were made to ensure no resonant conditions existed. However, high vibration levels were still found on the motor. Further investigation of the uncoupled motor vibration and phase identified a bent motor shaft. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Alignment readings were all within tolerance for the 3,600 RPM machine. Soft foot problems were minimal and were removed with step shimming. Due to the extremely high vibration readings in the order of 0.8 inch/second velocity, which was predominantly in the horizontal direction, resonance was suspected. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Chart1.gif src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200803_Reli_Action-Chart1.gif"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Chart 1. Comparison of motor points with bent shaft. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An investigation of the motor mounting structure revealed a stiff, good supporting structure. Bump tests on the motor found the natural frequency well above and out of range of influence by the motor operating speed. Resonance was ruled out, so the unit was started and phase data was taken. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Horizontal readings found similar amplitudes of 0.7 to 0.8 inch/second at 180 degrees out-of-phase between motor bearings. Much lower vertical readings were found on the outboard (opposite drive end) motor bearing of 0.02 inch/second and a high of 0.26 inch/second at the inboard (drive end) bearing at 180 degrees out-of-phase. Axial readings on the motor from one end to the other showed acceptable vibration levels, but at 180 degrees out-of-phase. Phase readings across the coupling showed mostly in-phase readings with low, acceptable vibration readings on the compressor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Misalignment was suspected, but to rule out motor rotor imbalance and a possible bent motor rotor, an uncoupled motor run was requested. Vibration levels were low vertically, but still somewhat elevated horizontally for an uncoupled motor - in the order of 0.1 inch/second at running speed. Phase readings were mostly all in-phase except for axial end-to-end comparison. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The difference in horizontal to vertical readings along with the axial out-of-phase suggested a possible bent rotor. Dial indicator readings did find the motor stub shaft bent by 0.009 inch at the coupling hub mounting location, tapering back to less than 0.002 inch run-out near the shoulder before the inboard bearing. The effects of the bent shaft were greatly exaggerated in the coupled condition, resulting in the coupled amplitude and phase readings mentioned previously. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Reli_Action-Chart2.gif src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200803_Reli_Action-Chart2.gif"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Chart 2. Readings before and after the bent shaft. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The motor repair shop stated that they had balanced the rotor to "as low as we could get it"; however, we had not provided any balance criteria, nor had we requested any vibration testing at the motor shop prior to shipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the location of the bent shaft, it is likely that the motor shop would have never seen the effects of the bent shaft with the rotor on a balance machine. Shaft run-out tolerances were never included as part of the repair specifications by our company, and none of the repair documentation was provided by the motor shop. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Had we requested shaft run-out checks during repair and provided acceptance criteria that included a final vibration reading and analysis before the motor was shipped, it is likely we may have caught this problem at the motor shop. Now, we have no idea if the shaft was bent during initial disassembly, during shipment to the motor shop, while at the motor shop or damaged upon return shipment. We had no case for liability against the motor shop, so the cost of the repairs fell on us. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the future, we plan to specify balance acceptance criteria, disassembly "As-Found" and "As-Left" criteria, and request review of vibration signatures on repaired motors prior to shipment. We are also developing job plans for alignment work to include checking shaft and coupling hub run-outs as part of the initial steps to performing alignment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/hrCy9eqLQDE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Motor technology in diaphragm pumps</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Named for a technique commonly used on failing pumps, "percussion maintenance" - where a technician beats on the pump's stalled motor with a hammer or rubber mallet - often indicates motor deficiencies in a diaphragm pump. Though it is impossible for the maintenance department to predict when a pump will stall, such maintenance techniques are often the result of poor motor design. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whether in the process, original equipment manufacturing or industrial market, diaphragm pump performance is critical to plant operation. However, many plants view diaphragm pumps as commodity items and continue to invest in underperforming platforms. And with the purchase price of diaphragm pumps comprising as little as 5 percent of the overall cost of ownership, operating the wrong pump can lead to significant financial losses. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There may be several reasons for substandard performance, including application demands, fluid composition, pump specifications, compressed air contamination, air leakage, debris, and general wear and tear. However, three of the biggest complaints - freezing, stalling and poor energy efficiency - are often due to insufficient motor design. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied-Reli_Pumps1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200801_Applied-Reli_Pumps1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Pump performance is critical to your plant's operations. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;PROBLEM: FREEZING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Freezing is a chronic problem in many applications, causing the motor to seize up and fail. Freezing occurs as compressed air expands, creating a severe decrease in pressure. As the air returns to atmospheric pressure, it turns extremely cold, freezing any moisture in the air supply. This cold air has been measured as low as minus-30 degrees, causing ice particles to accumulate and clog the motor area and muffler. The ice buildup stalls the pump, and it remains down until ambient air or another device can melt the ice. Many facilities develop workarounds, implementing space heaters, hot water taps and other thawing mechanisms. However, these efforts tie up a plant's maintenance team and require additional resources. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The most effective solution is to utilize a pump that exhausts air from the chamber as quickly as possible. Diaphragm pumps should not allow exhaust to go through critical motor components, such as the spool valves. When this happens, the exhaust port becomes blocked with ice, causing the motor to slow down or stop completely. Instead, the most effective motor designs on the market today eliminate pump ice-up by protecting the major air valve from cold, wet exhaust air. Internal components that divert the exhaust air away from the major air valve and into an expansion chamber dramatically increase pump reliability and remove the need for ice preventive devices. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;PROBLEM: STALLING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though manufacturers often claim their products are "unstallable," many pumps on the market today do a poor job of managing the pressure acting on air valves. The best way to tell whether a pump will stall is to look at its air valve design. Conventional valves feature a "balanced" design in which the valve is too evenly weighted. Air valves with this design often generate poor shift signals and, over time, the valve centers with an equal pressure differential on both sides. These pressures cancel each other out and the air valve does not shift, causing the pump to stall. Many pumps are also susceptible to stalling during restart. When fluid valves are shut off, pressure in the pump equalizes and it can be difficult to make the air valve begin shifting again. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The best diaphragm pumps available today eliminate air valve centering by utilizing an "unbalanced" valve design. This air valve design features a large diameter on one end of the valve and a small diameter on the opposite end, creating the optimal pressure differential. Since the valves are always biased toward one side, they do not center out and stall the pump, even under low air inlet pressures. Unbalanced valves reduce production loss and downtime by providing better shift signals and delivering faster trip-over with more flow. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied-Reli_Pumps2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200801_Applied-Reli_Pumps2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;Innovative designs and materials have &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;dramatically increased pump reliability. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;PROBLEM: POOR EFFICIENCY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bad motor design also creates poor energy efficiency. In diaphragm pumps, this means underperforming seals and valves. Many manufacturers utilize an O-ring configuration on spools to prevent air leakage, but this design often wears and creates a poor seal, creating air blow-by and reducing efficiency. Blow-by is also caused by a metal-to-metal lapped-fit valve design. This model utilizes a spool with a slightly smaller diameter than the bore it is in, creating a gap that allows compressed air to escape. Air leaks past the valve during operation in a dead-head condition, exhausting to the atmosphere and significantly decreasing energy efficiency. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Buyers should be cautious when seeking to increase efficiency. Even though many manufacturers now advertise energy-efficient diaphragm pumps, there can be more than 40 percent difference among competing brands. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The best diaphragm pump motors utilize a positive seal on the valve spool created by U-cups to maximize energy efficiency. These prevent air leakage by providing a positive seal as the valve shifts. Additionally, seal points should be made of solid materials (ceramic components are often best), where applicable, to ensure longer life. Special materials such as over-molded sleeves should be utilized to increase lubricity and reduce or eliminate wear in the valving mechanisms. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many manufacturers also put carbon and glass into moldings to create a stronger housing for the valve. These abrasive materials can migrate to the surface and rub against the seals, decreasing seal life. The best construction features over-molded, pure materials with no abrasive fillers, creating strong housings and good surfaces. These and other features can save plants hundreds of dollars each year per pump. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;FUTURE OF MOTOR TECH &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In years past, the main concern of manufacturers was flow rate, but that has begun to change over the last five years. As plants increasingly become energy conscious, more customers better balance pump productivity and air consumption. These manufacturers continue to optimize motor designs to get the most production out of the least air volume. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Diaphragm pumps will continue to emerge as viable continuous-duty pumps, particularly in the process industry. New materials, technology and better construction have eliminated the perception that these pumps are not as effective as their counterparts. Innovative designs and materials have dramatically increased pump reliability, efficiency and durability, and provided additional chemical compatibility and abrasion resistance. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>The basics of motor circuit analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Quite a bit of confusion exists on the subject of motor circuit analysis. The confusion is centered on two issues: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The very name of the technology. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What this technology is capable of. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article will focus on alleviating that confusion with a discussion of the technology's capabilities and its proper name. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the biggest reasons why confusion exists about the very name of this testing methodology is the prevalent use of three-letter acronyms (TLAs) in the condition monitoring industry. We have TLAs for everything: CBM (condition-based monitoring), PdM (predictive maintenance), RCA (root cause analysis), FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), etc., etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is the pervasiveness of TLAs that has created this confusion around motor circuit analysis. MCA can mean two different things. Motor circuit analysis (MCA) is often and easily confused with motor current analysis (MCA), which is an abbreviated version of motor current signature analysis (MCSA). This is a common mistake and one that has contributed to the confusion surrounding the second common mistake. For the balance of this article, the term motor circuit analysis will be referred to as MCA. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second common mistake lies in the confusion around the capabilities of this technology for condition monitoring and testing. For those who have mistakenly associated MCA with motor current signature analysis, the belief is that the only type of testing performed is on the motor current. While a portion of this is correct, current analysis is just a part of the total testing barrage that is collectively known as MCA. There is a second group of people that believe MCA only pertains to measuring the motor circuit's resistance-to-ground characteristics. This belief also reflects an incomplete understanding of the spectrum of tests covered under MCA. While MCA does incorporate these aforementioned testing techniques, it also includes much more. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Before we go any further, let us clarify the ultimate goal of MCA. The goal of MCA is to ascertain the health of the motor. This assessment is accomplished through the detection of electrical imbalances in the motor and the detection of insulation degradation. The unbalances create stray, circulating currents through the motor. These circulating currents create excessive heat and lead to accelerated insulation degradation, inefficient operation and ineffective control techniques (in some motor types). Insulation degradation leads to shortened motor life and can lead to unsafe operating conditions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To begin, let us break up MCA into two major categories. The first category is online testing, named because the tests are conducted while the motor is operating under normal conditions. The second category is offline testing; tests are conducted while the motor is de-energized. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MCA online can be further split into two categories - current analysis and voltage analysis. Current analysis is primarily focused on the rotating components. Loose or broken rotor bars, cracked end rings, rotor eccentricity, misalignment and coupling/belt problems are some of the "big-hitter" failure modes detected in the current signature. Power quality issues like harmful harmonics, voltage imbalances and under/over-voltages are among the issues identified with voltage analysis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MCA offline is most famous for the resistance-to-ground measurement. But other measurements make motor circuit defects easy to find. Measuring electrical characteristics like impedance, inductance and capacitance tell the analyst plenty about the condition of the windings. Inductance is a great indicator of turn-to-turn shorts. Capacitance to ground measures the amount of winding contamination (water, dirt, dust, etc.). Changes in each of these affect impedance (total resistance of an AC circuit). These characteristics are measured phase to phase and phase to ground and compared to each other and to percent change from baseline to identify motor circuit defects. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some of the tests can serve as one-time go/no-go types of inspection. Some must be trended over time to understand the defect progression. The best strategy is the testing of motors on a set schedule. This allows you to properly trend these characteristics and gives the reliability program the best conditional probability of finding motor circuit defects. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All of the failure modes listed are very real and create unplanned downtime. A comprehensive, failure modes-driven maintenance strategy for electric motors incorporates all of these test methods. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How many are you using to effectively and efficiently ensure your operation's production capacity? &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Proposed motor efficiency standards can save energy, money</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;img align="right" height="118" hspace="3" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_DOE1.jpg" width="150" /&gt;Cutaway image of a NEMA Design B Premium efficiency motor. The &lt;a href="http://www.copper.org/applications/electrical/energy/motor_text.html"&gt;Copper Development Association&lt;/a&gt; notes that all motors experience losses (the energy &amp;quot;fees&amp;quot; a motor charges as part of the electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion process), but the magnitude of the loss varies, even among motors of the same make, type and size. In general, losses are higher for standard-efficiency motors (pre-EPAct) than for motors that meet EPAct energy-efficiency standards. Motors that meet or exceed NEMA Premium efficiency standards have even lower losses. (Photo courtesy of Emerson Motor Company) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (&lt;a href="http://www.aceee.org"&gt;ACEEE&lt;/a&gt;) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (&lt;a href="http://www.nema.org"&gt;NEMA&lt;/a&gt;) have jointly developed and recommended new electric motor standards for Congress to consider in upcoming energy legislation. The proposed standards will help foster more widespread use of both energy-efficient and NEMA Premium efficiency motors, which have even higher efficiencies than either standard motors or those specified as energy efficient in the 1992 Energy Policy Act (&lt;a href="http://www.aceee.org/Motors/epact.htm"&gt;EPAct&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This past spring, ACEEE and NEMA submitted their recommendations to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for their consideration in preparing new energy bills. The two organizations recommended that efficiency standards be established or increased for three categories of electric motors no later than 36 months from the date of enactment of new energy legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both ACEEE and NEMA have worked with the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/"&gt;Industrial Technologies Program&lt;/a&gt; (ITP) to help industry save energy and money in &lt;a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/techpubs_motors.html"&gt;motor-driven&lt;/a&gt; and other industrial systems through information, tool development, and collaborations on technical projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Neal Elliott, industrial program director at ACEEE, points out that significant energy and cost savings will be possible under the new standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These standards will provide major energy and cost savings to industrial and commercial motor users while helping to moderate the growth in electricity demand in this country,&amp;quot; Elliott says. &amp;quot;In the industrial sector, motors account for more than two-thirds of the electricity consumed. These standards will save more than 8 trillion kilowatt-hours by 2030, with a net cost savings to electric consumers of almost $500 million.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Recommendations in the Proposed Standards &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, ACEEE and NEMA recommend increasing current mandatory minimum efficiency standards for general-purpose, integral-horsepower induction motors to &amp;quot;NEMA Premium&amp;quot; efficiency standards (see Table 12-12 in NEMA Standards Publication MG-1, 2006) (&lt;a href="http://www.nema.org/stds/complimentary-docs/upload/MG1.pdf"&gt;PDF 199 KB&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"&gt;Download Adobe Reader&lt;/a&gt;. This efficiency level is already a requirement for new motors in federal facilities, under the purchasing guidelines of the &lt;a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/femp/"&gt;Federal Energy Management Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, they propose establishing energy-efficient motor standards for seven types of low-voltage, polyphase, integral-horsepower induction motors not currently covered under federal laws. Specifically, they propose no longer excluding the seven motor classes that were excluded in 1992 EPAct standards for electric motors of 1 to 200 horsepower (hp). The seven classes are U-frame, NEMA Design C, close-coupled pump, footless, vertical solid-shaft-normal thrust and 8-pole (900 rpm) motors, and all polyphase voltages up to 600 volts (other than 230- and 460-volt motors). This modification extends the coverage of the minimum energy-efficient motor standard to 200- and 575-volt motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Third, they propose that NEMA Design B, general-purpose, 201- to 500-horsepower motors meet minimum full-load efficiency values for energy-efficient motors. These values are specified in Table 12-11 of NEMA Standards Publication MG-1, 2006 (&lt;a href="http://www.nema.org/stds/complimentary-docs/upload/MG1.pdf"&gt;PDF 199 KB&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html"&gt;Download Adobe Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Tax Credits Also Proposed &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ACEEE and NEMA have also recommended that motor manufacturers and end-users receive federal tax credits for producing or buying premium-efficiency electric motors even before the new standards take effect. This would help expedite production and use of the motors, and it would provide environmental benefits in terms of lower electricity use and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since most premium-efficiency motors have a useful life of more than 20 years, purchasing them now can help manufacturers start realizing benefits right away and for many years to come, according to ACEEE. The organization estimates that the tax credits would result in an additional 700 million kilowatt-hours and $40 million in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This agreement demonstrates the mutual benefits that industry and the energy efficiency community can accomplish by working together,&amp;quot; says Susan Coakley, executive director of Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (&lt;a href="http://www.neep.org"&gt;NEEP&lt;/a&gt;), which worked with ACEEE and NEMA on developing the proposed standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For more information, see the &lt;a href="http://www.aceee.org/press/0703motors.htm"&gt;news releases from ACEEE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nema.org/media/pr/20070328b.cfm"&gt;NEMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Replacing your DC motors? Think AC</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Alternating-current (AC) and direct-current (DC) motors have traditionally served distinctly different applications due to their construction and inherent operating characteristics. In general, AC motors were smaller, less expensive, lighter and more rugged than DC motors. DC motors, on the other hand, operated better in variable-speed applications, particularly those requiring wide speed ranges, and provided more precise speed control. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;DC motors have been the workhorse of industry in many applications where variable-speed operation is needed. In these applications, DC motors are reliable and provide precise speed control under variable operating conditions. However, DC motors are expensive to purchase and to maintain. In addition, over the past 10 years, AC drives have improved to the point where their speed control is far more precise, rivaling that of servo drives. What's more, the AC motor and drive together often cost about the same price as the DC motor alone. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The development of modern AC motors and drives is blurring the distinctions that once governed the choice between AC and DC drives. The result is that lower-cost, more-reliable AC drives are moving into applications once reserved for DC drives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Motor_photo.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200707_Applied_Reli-Motor_photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Phot0 1. A typical AC motor and drive package.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;THE RISE OF AC DRIVES &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;AC drives use a solid-state, adjustable-frequency inverter that adjusts frequency and voltage to vary the speed of an otherwise fixed-speed AC motor. This control is typically produced through pulse width modulation (PWM) of the drive output to the motor. Voltage and frequency are maintained in a constant relationship at any motor speed (known as the volts-to-hertz ratio). 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;AC drives are preferred when the motor environment is corrosive, potentially explosive, hazardous or wet, and demands special enclosures (explosion-proof, washdown, etc.). AC drives are also a good choice when the motors will receive little maintenance, either because they are inaccessible or because plant maintenance practices are poor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;AC drives generally are smaller and lighter than DC drives for a given torque and speed output, and they are capable of speeds approaching 10,000 rpm. In addition, a single AC drive can control multiple motors. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Modern AC motors and drives provide a number of additional operating benefits that rival those traditionally available only from DC drives. For example, today's drives can now produce full torque at start-up, something that once was impossible. They also are capable of speed ranges of 1,000:1 vs. only around 10:1 with previous AC drives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Variable-speed AC drives also can adjust to fast-changing loads and provide tight speed regulation. When operated in closed-loop systems, AC drives can regulate speeds to within 0.01 percent and less. This makes them suitable for applications requiring high dynamic response, such as web processes, material handling sorter conveyors, metering pumps, extruders and test stands. The table on the next page compares the capabilities of standard DC motor drives and modern variable-speed AC drives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Improved control technology is the reason for the vast improvement in AC drive performance. Today's inverters are smaller, less expensive, and they provide more capabilities than a few years ago. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although AC motors have been capable of operating over huge speed ranges for some time, the drives available could not match their performance. Now, AC drives can produce near-servo-drive performance in a compact, reasonably priced package. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Motor_photo2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200707_Applied_Reli-Motor_photo2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Photo 2. AC motors can provide you with a considerable cost savings when compared to DC motors. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;SPEED CONTROL EFFECTS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;AC motors have traditionally operated at fixed frequency and speed. At this speed, the built-in cooling system keeps the motor from overheating. Operating an induction motor as a variable-speed motor increases operating temperature and places increased stress on the insulation system. The higher temperatures result from increased motor losses and reduced heat transfer. As a result, many standard-efficient, fixed-frequency motors will not produce their nameplate rating when operated by an adjustable-frequency control. The elevated temperatures may not lead to immediate insulation failure; however, they will shorten life considerably. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In most insulation systems, a 10-degree Celsius increase in operating temperature will reduce expected life by 50 percent. This is one reason why energy-efficient or premium-efficient motors, which operate at cooler temperatures under the same conditions of service, are often recommended for operation with adjustable-frequency drives. Another reason that adjustable-frequency, drive-controlled, fixed-frequency motors operate at higher temperatures is that the cooling fan operates directly off the motor shaft. Thus, as motor speed varies, so does fan speed, resulting in lower cooling at slower speeds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When operated as adjustable-speed devices, motor cooling will be reduced at slower speeds. In such applications, the motor should be specifically designed for variable-speed operation. AC variable-speed motors usually state their speed range. If you apply the motor within the specified speed range, overheating should not be an issue. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200707_Pg4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This chart compares the capabilities of standard DC motor drives with those of modern variable-speed AC drives. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;OTHER CONSIDERATIONS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When system performance requirements are minimal, a standard AC induction motor often can be applied successfully in adjustable-frequency, variable-speed applications. However, when performance requirements are more demanding, an energy-efficient, premium-efficient or definite-purpose inverter-rated motor must be used. This is particularly true when maximum productivity is required. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While the definition of high-performance is indefinite, one or more of the following factors usually characterizes such applications: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Continuous, constant torque required below 50 percent of the base speed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Continuous, constant horsepower required above 150 percent of the base speed. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;High starting loads or overloads. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;High dynamic performance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A process that cannot be started or run without variable-speed control. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some AC motors are designed specifically to run on AF power and can provide continuous constant torque down to zero speed (1,000:1 turn-down). These designs are available in traditional totally enclosed, fan-cooled (TEFC) National Electrical Manufacturer's Association (NEMA) frame ratings or in very power-dense designs that look similar to the traditional square-frame DC. These power-dense designs are cooled with an auxiliary blower (force ventilated or blower cooled) or totally enclosed, fan-cooled construction, which eliminates the blower. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In higher horsepower ratings, these power-dense, blower-cooled designs represent a considerable cost saving vs. traditional fixed-speed motors. In addition, motors designed specifically for inverter-duty, high-performance applications have greater speed range, offer higher overload capability, and include thermal protection and mounting provision for speed-regulation devices. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Progress in AC drives makes life easier for operators </title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;ABB offers one of the world's largest portfolios of AC drives, serving an expanding horizon of applications. With increasing demands for flexibility, reliability and ease of use, ABB has come up with a number of solutions to make life simpler and cheaper for its customers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By combining functions and cutting part counts, ABB has reduced the size of its drives while enhancing their reliability. The company has also developed a simplified set-up procedure using a harmonized keypad and software wizards that can be used across the ABB drive family. More complex programming can be carried out using ABB's Adaptive Programming utility and parameters can be transferred between drives using ABB's patented FlashDrop technology. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All these advances are part of an ongoing effort at ABB to offer cutting-edge technology in high-performance yet user-friendly systems. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Traditionally, the primary use of drives has been in such applications as powering pumps, fans and conveyors. And while they will continue to be used in these applications, today's end-users have a very different approach to that of a decade ago. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drives are now fully developed and are, therefore, more widely accepted as a product. The need to answer the question, "what does it do?" has been replaced by the expectation that the drive will "just do it." This shift in attitude brings with it the assumption that the drives are simple to buy, simple to install, simple to start up, simple to commission, and simple to own and run. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the same time, drives are finding new applications: in exercise machines, pizza ovens, honey centrifuges and car washes. In these applications, the drive is very definitely considered a commodity, and the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who may not traditionally have used drives, are once again demanding pure simplicity. In fact, a recent survey showed that simple controls and set-ups (70 percent) and convenient operator interfaces (53 percent) were rated as "very important" by AC drives users. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The quest for miniaturization&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Simplicity and ease of use manifest themselves in many ways. The mere fact that drives can now be used in domestic washing machines is a testimony to their extreme compactness. Drives have become smaller, more capable, easier to use and cheaper, by orders of magnitude. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Smaller drives are easier to install. Panel builders are able to fit more drives into a standard cubicle, so the whole panel can be smaller. This allows the use of smaller and less costly control rooms. It also becomes easier for OEMs to fit drives into their equipment. A classic example of this is in cranes, an application that has always had very limited space for the drive. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The reductions in drive size have resulted from the use of fewer components, greater packing density, improvements in semiconductor technology and improved cooling techniques. In fact, there has been a ten-fold decrease in the size of drives over the past 10 years. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Driving down cost&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An additional benefit of reducing the component count in a drive is that it cuts costs. ABB predicts that, over the next few years, the parts count of its drives will be reduced by approximately 20 percent through the use of integrated electronics to eliminate separate components such as external flash and RAM memories and analog/digital converters. Mechanical parts are also being integrated, for example, by combining frames and enclosures, allowing them to perform multiple functions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reducing part count also enhances reliability: fewer parts mean fewer interfaces and fewer mechanical fixings, which are often a source of failures. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Improved cooling&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Advances in the development of power semiconductors have also helped to improve drives. A reduction in the power losses per unit area of silicon used means that the same silicon area is able to handle more power. This has enabled smaller semiconductors and reduced the need for cooling within the drive. This, in turn, allows the use of smaller heat sinks and reduced air volumes inside the drive â the result is smaller and smaller drives. The only limitations are the terminals because these must accommodate cables that are large enough to carry sufficient current to the drive. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it is not just the development of power semiconductors that has enabled miniaturization of drives. Of prime importance is the technology used for cooling. Considerable R&amp;amp;D effort is being put into developing new cooling techniques, as well as into reducing the need for cooling. &lt;BR&gt;While air cooling is likely to remain the dominant technique, liquid cooling is finding increasing use in areas such as wind power, transportation and marine applications. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Increased functionality&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These ever-shrinking drives contain ever-expanding functionality â thanks to developments in software. Today's software monitors, diagnoses, configures and archives information and parameters concerning drives in industrial plants. Set-ups are performed entirely using software functions, and then downloaded to the appropriate drives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The set-up information is archived for future retrieval. To obtain the full benefit of this technology, however, operators must still refer to the user manual. Drives manufacturers are striving to develop intelligent control panels that will significantly decrease the need for paper-based manuals. The secret, though, is to find an easy way of accessing this kind of functionality. Enter the keypad. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The ideal keypad&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ABB's R&amp;amp;D team scrutinized every aspect of how a user interfaces with a drive and developed what it believes is the most user-friendly keypad ever. The keypad for the ABB standard drive features only eight soft keys, through which all parameters, functionality and set-ups can be accessed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even the actual buttons on the keypad were carefully selected to ensure that just the right level of built-in resistance gives the user the feeling of stability and accurate key-press detection. To develop the keypad, ABB compiled 11 guiding usability principles that consider all aspects of visibility and readability; the type of text and terminology; and the icons used. Based on this, ABB is now harmonizing the keypads of all of its drives. A common look and feel allows the users to switch between different products easily, without having to go through a time-consuming learning process for each new product. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The true value of the keypad&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The advantages are not all aesthetic. There is a real financial incentive for customers to choose this keypad and its intuitive commands. Most equipment investment decisions now carry a proviso for fast installation to ensure that production will start rapidly and smoothly. Paramount is the speed with which a machine can be up and running after the installation of new equipment or after a maintenance shutdown. If a machine breaks down, it can cost the operator $20,000 per hour, so easy set-up and commissioning are a priority. Such urgency increases the risk of errors in installation and commissioning. These can be overcome by eliminating manual intervention wherever possible; the keypad is central to this aim. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These guiding principles, and the fact that there are only eight keys on the keypad, suggested the need for intuitive assistance. ABB developed a series of "wizards" aimed at guiding the user through various procedures. There are "maintenance assistants," "diagnostic assistants" and, one of the most widely used, a "start-up assistant." &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The magic of wizards&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the start-up assistant, ABB provides a tool that guides the user through both start-up and commissioning by asking questions in plain text language. There are no complex parameter numbers or codes. The product's intelligence helps the user through the commissioning process. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For an OEM who might buy 4,000 AC drives per year, the time saved by using an easy start-up system such as ABB's wizard can be significant. It can cut 15 minutes from the commissioning time of each drive, equating to a time saving of 1,000 hours per year. For an engineer working 2,000 hours per year, this is half a man-year. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A common look and feel allows the users to switch between different ABB products easily, without having to go through a time-consuming learning process for each new product. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Specialist HMI&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another tool that makes life easier for the OEM is a hand-held human-machine interface (HMI) that allows drive parameters to be installed in seconds. Called FlashDrop and available with selected ABB drives, the device can be used to select and set parameters, and to copy configurations between drives, without even powering up the drive. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;FlashDrop is a patented new technology from ABB that streamlines the drive configuration process, allowing users to download a set of parameters in just two seconds. No specialized knowledge is required to use FlashDrop and the user interface will be familiar to users of ABB drives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While the HMI is clearly important, ABB has also been looking at ways to simplify customer applications using the functionality packed into a drive. One of the drivers is the customer's interest in total cost of ownership, which includes commissioning, swap-outs and maintenance. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Application-specific solutions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;AC drive users can now reduce costs even more by employing application-specific drive solutions. These drives incorporate incremental functionality that supports specific applications such as fan and pump control, mixers or crane controls. They can reduce the total cost of ownership through shorter start-up times, lower integration costs and improved machine productivity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Time savings during commissioning can range from one to several hours. The process does not require expert programmers and, therefore, saves the considerable expense of sending commissioning engineers around the globe to fine-tune individual drives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Take, for example, ABB's new pump control software module, Intelligent Pump Control (IPC), which eliminates the need for an external PLC (programmable logic controller) and can help to save energy, reduce downtime and prevent pump jamming and pipeline blocking. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The IPC is a software add-on for ABB industrial drives. It contains all the common functions needed by water and waste utilities, industrial plants and other pump users through six pump control functions. The software also incorporates ABB's adaptive programming utility, enabling users to customize drives for specific applications. This utility consists of a set of simple-to-use blocks that can be programmed to perform any operation from a predefined set of functions. All common mathematical and logical functions as well as switches, comparators, filters and timers are available. These days, users can have the power of a small PLC inside their drive in the form of ABB's Adaptive Programming. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A further breakthrough is that programming can be carried out using the standard control panel. No special hardware or software programming tools are needed. As a result, the programming takes only a few minutes and can be carried out on-site, during commissioning. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Technology that stands the test of time&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even well-established technology does not stand still. It is now 11 years since ABB launched its revolutionary motor control platform, Direct Torque Control (DTC). Now the algorithms have been tweaked in order to move standard AC drive technology into the servo arena. The result is the launch of the ABB machinery drive. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The drive uses standard AC drive technology, but, by tuning DTC to include a motor model designed for servo motors, and by using very fast torque control loops within DTC â along with some other clever design work â &amp;nbsp;the drive can now reach servo drive performance levels. It can control synchronous or asynchronous motors, either open or closed loop. With the new drive, depending on the application, machinery builders need specify only one drive for a variety of motor types along with an appropriate feedback device. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Three modules&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Despite their significance, the advances described so far are only part of the story. The ABB machinery drive features another significant major breakthrough aimed at meeting head-on the challenges faced by OEMs. This is the use of three plug-in modules that house the heart and brains of the drive. On the hardware side, there is a power module and a control interface module, while the software module provides easy programming of the relay logic or PLC routines that an OEM may require for its own applications. It is the way in which these modules are used that will reduce commissioning times, eliminate the need for external maintenance engineers and minimize unpredicted production line stoppages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By providing separate units, both the power module and control interface can be shipped to site and installed ahead of the software memory unit. When the installation is complete, the memory unit, which can be programmed on the OEM's own premises with specific application code, can be delivered and simply plugged into the control interface on site. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The modular approach also allows the number of product components and variants to be reduced. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since there is no need for on-site programming or the connection of any communication cables to PCs, time savings during commissioning can range from one to several hours. The process does not require expert programmers and therefore saves the considerable expense of sending commissioning engineers around the globe to fine tune individual drives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The future&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;AC drives are set to be smaller, more intelligent, easier to install and control, have better communications, and be suitable for many more applications â particularly at the low power end of the range â all at a constantly reducing price. What better future could drive users ask for? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/motors/~4/Fj1IOzz0R5Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Managing motors and reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Many are aware of the use of motor circuit analysis and infrared imaging in a predictive maintenance (PdM) program for motors. It is a program that, when performed properly, increases uptime, reliability and productivity, ultimately impacting the thing most managers want to see: lowered or stabilized maintenance costs. However, there may not be an understanding or awareness of the benefits and impact that an effective motor management system can have on that cost. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This article will show basic key elements for a motor management system and provide an understanding of why a motor management system is much more than just a reliability and testing program. In fact, motor reliability and testing are two key components that make a significant contribution to a motor management system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure_motor1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Applied_Reli_Figure_motor1.jpg"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli_Figure_motor2.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200705_Applied_Reli_Figure_motor2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Infrared thermography is just one part of an effective motor management system. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;SHORT STORY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was once an employee who asked a lot of questions. This caused much consternation among the bosses and fellow workers. "A-ha!" the bosses thought. "We will promote him. Then he can answer his own questions!" They continued on, happily thinking this was the answer; however, to their chagrin, more questions followed. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the meantime, this newly promoted supervisor was given approximately nine hats to wear. One of them was to oversee the Motor Shop. So, where else could he start? With a bit of authority that accompanied the promotion, he created a team. A few questions got answered, a few things changed. Before anyone knew it, a motor management system began to take shape. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first six months were very difficult indeed, and another 12 rough months would pass. After 18 months, a faint glimmer of light could be seen at the end of the tunnel. Though people had fought tooth and nail against it, a few eyes began to flutter and some popped open when it was revealed that repair, inventory and purchase costs had been reduced nearly $1 million. Suddenly, the questions, ideas and actions no longer seemed so trivial. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Looking back, it was easy to see the well-traveled road littered with the debris of good intentions, false assumptions, erroneous information, etc. All this and more created a climate where bad decisions were made and money wasted. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, the first practice stopped in those first 18 months was repairing motors for $900 that only cost $200 when new. This was just the tip of the iceberg. Energy-consumption issues were later added to the equation, as well as other reliability principles and testing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WHAT IS IT? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Managing motor assets requires that a motor's location, function, repair, testing and reliability history be documented, preferably in one place. This documentation should be easily accessed for research and used to assist in making correct and appropriate repair/replace decisions. Motor testing doesn't create a motor management system, but it should be a key component. At a minimum, such a system should have the following components: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor manager: someone who is in charge and accountable &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Storage: outdoors is not acceptable &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A preferred, accountable repair facility &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Repair specifications for the repair facility to use &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A cost-saving contract for purchasing new motors from a primary vendor &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reliability testing: off-line, on-line, infrared and even vibration &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Acceptance testing of repaired motors and new motors, if possible &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tracking motors from purchase through scrap and the history in between &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A decision tree for determining repair vs. replacement &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A system to address energy consumption and efficiency &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WHO'S IN CHARGE? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The person in charge (the motor manager) doesn't have to be a motor expert; however, he or she should be somewhat knowledgeable on motor basics. This person also needs to have knowledge of the motor contract with the preferred new motor vendor and the preferred motor repair facility. The motor manager oversees all aspects of motor purchases, repairs, modifications, history and disposal. He or she should be a member of the site equipment reliability team and should interface often with the reliability manager on matters pertaining to motor testing and reliability. Managing motors doesn't have to be this person's only area of responsibility. He or she can wear other hats, as well. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once an effective motor management system has been in operation for a time, and employees and other managers become educated as to how it works, it should become easier to manage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;STORAGE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Motors never should be stored outdoors. Ideally, they should be stored in a climate-controlled facility. Climate-controlled storage facilities are rare. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Warehouse personnel are normally tasked with the day-to-day activities of normal motor storage - from receiving, issuing to and shipping to the repair shop. Personnel should be familiar with how to handle and store motors to avoid incidental damage during the storage process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Large AC motors (high voltage) sometimes need special handling and storage areas. Connect motors with internal heaters to a voltage source while in storage to keep the windings dry. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;REPAIRS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every effort should be made to identify a preferred and accountable motor repair facility within a reasonable driving distance. Preferred means a vendor that can handle just about everything that you send to it. This facility shouldn't object to inspection visits and should warranty its work in some manner and work with you on all levels of repair. Repair quality and reliability should be the guiding criteria. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A contract with a preferred repair facility can be negotiated to reduce repair cost over what it may have been. An ideal situation would be that the repair facility is also a dealer for the preferred new motor vendor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then there are the special, one-of-a-kind and non-standard motors that have to be addressed. Have you seen the suffix TY, TCY, TZ or TCZ (for instance, 286TCZ)? If so, they are the "non-standard" variety and might only be acquired from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), not the motor manufacturer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If the OEM is totally out of business (not acquired by another company), a replacement motor may not be available. Having the right repair facility can come in handy with these motors. Also, by having an understanding of what alternatives are available and the knowledge of what to use as a substitute, the plant can stay running. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;NEW MOTORS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anyone operating without a preferred new motor vendor contract could be losing money. A contract with a preferred new motor vendor may reduce purchase prices by 20 to 40 percent. Large corporations may already have a contract with a preferred new motor vendor. This should be followed, whenever possible, within the guidelines. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;RELIABILITY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reliability consists of many things, such as engineering, testing and inspection: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Engineering: Is the motor designed and/or repaired to perform the task it is asked to do? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Testing: motors and their circuits. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infrared: It is very important to have baseline images and stated "normal" temperatures. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vibration: baseline data. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When testing or inspecting a motor, it is important to ask, "Is this the motor I think it is?" or "Was this the same one that was there the last time?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor reliability and testing technician shouldn't be considered the motor manager. However, the tech is a key partner in the management of motor assets, along with maintenance managers, mechanics, warehouse people, purchasing people, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reliability and testing technician also should have a working relationship with the preferred repair vendor in order to assist in problem resolutions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;DECISION TREE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every motor management system should have a decision tree. Use the tree to help you make repair or replace decisions. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most decision trees lack one important item. This is a branch or section to help determine whether a motor should be equipped with a roller bearing on the shaft end. This is a critical decision for motors driving equipment through belts. Don't construe this to mean that all motors driving belts should have a roller bearing on the shaft end. Each case should be considered separately as to whether a roller bearing would be applicable. This issue is also very important when making a purchase decision for a new motor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;TRACKING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tracking a motor from birth to burial is difficult, at best. A properly functioning and effective motor management system makes it easier and can pay for itself in man-hours saved, energy efficiency, reduced inventory and (above all) reliability. A key element to tracking is assigning a unique identification to each motor. The ID should not be removable. A good practice is to engrave the unique identifier on a motor. Engravings aren't easily removed and remain legible for years of service. More often than not, they outlast the motor. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The area where the J-box is mounted normally provides a large enough surface area, as do other areas on the motor. Don't engrave end bells with the identifier in the event an end bell is replaced. The engraving should be as deep as possible and legible. Stamping is not recommended because there is a risk of cracking the casting. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Relying on the nameplate for identification can be frustrating, especially if the nameplate is removed or becomes unreadable because of corrosion, etc. Motor shops often install a replacement nameplate, but only the basic information is usually put on it and other important information may be lost if not recorded elsewhere. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are a number of ways to set up an identifier, but it should be uniform and not change from year to year. For example, a numeral system based on the year and the sequence the motor arrived can be assigned along with a letter designation for the name of the site - for instance, 99-035V. The 99 means it was 1999. The 035 means it was the 35th motor identified in 1999. The V stands for the name of the plant site. If it was an older motor that had not yet been identified, it would be assigned the next sequential number. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;HISTORY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;History is a sequential documentary of the life (birth to burial) of a motor. It's a very important piece to help determine whether to repair or replace a motor. Normally, a motor stator can't withstand many burnouts and rewinds without the core becoming degraded. Without a history, it's very difficult to know how many times it has been rewound, much less what else has been done to it or where it has been. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;History can be kept in many forms (a sample is shown below) and is normally tailored to a particular site or company. Whatever form it takes, it has to be easily used and not fragmented in different places to get a complete picture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A number of motor testing systems allow for history entry and retention. However, they present some limitations in regard to documenting a complete birth-to-death history, especially if there is no formal motor management system in place. History then becomes fragmented and sometimes of little use unless diligently administered. History is the lifeblood of any motor management system. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Note that ... &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reconditioned = Bearings, machining, cleaning, painting, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Overhauled = Rewound along with reconditioned items. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;EFFICIENCY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this day of increasing energy costs, particularly electricity, it pays to be energy conscious. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric motors consume a large percentage of electricity used in American industry. On average, approximately 63 percent of industrial electricity is consumed by electric motors. This percentage can reach 75 percent or more in certain industries. Also, motors can consume five to 12 times their initial purchase cost in energy per year. If you consider that a 25-horsepower motor, running 24/7, can consume up to $15,000 in energy per year and a 100-horsepower motor can consume up to $56,000 in energy per year, even small reductions in energy consumption per motor could result in substantial savings. Additionally, in the case of motors up to approximately 50 horsepower, the savings difference between using a standard-efficient vs. a premium-efficient motor could pay for the premium motor in one year. Every year after that would be money in the pocket. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Repair practices and quality can significantly influence energy consumption over original design. A rewound motor, especially if it was poorly done, can significantly increase energy consumption compared to the original "as built" specifications. That's a very important item to consider when making repair and replace decisions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This article doesn't outline every scenario nor address every aspect of motor management. However, the hope is that this information will be of help in developing more awareness concerning the issue of motor management and its complexities. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A motor management system, functioning at all levels, makes life easier, reduces cost, reduces inventory and reduces energy usage. This keeps everyone happy, including the reliability and testing technician.

            <title>Identifying motor defects through fault zone analysis</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Electrical maintenance personnel have for years been limited to troubleshooting with no more than a fluke and a Megger. This unfortunately does not provide enough information to allow most electricians to feel totally confident in determining if an electrical problem exists or not. A mechanical operator once said, &amp;ldquo;If a problem exists with a piece of equipment, and there is an electric cable within 10 feet of it, then it must be an electrical problem!&amp;rdquo; If you are involved with electric maintenance, you have probably heard at some time in your career, &amp;ldquo;It must be the motor.&amp;rdquo; If you are into mechanical maintenance, you have likely heard, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s probably the pump. Let&amp;rsquo;s uncouple it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This has been an ongoing battle and, up to recently, technology has been primarily developed for the mechanical side. Vibration shows a two times line frequency (2F L) spike and that must mean it&amp;rsquo;s electrical. Right? Wrong! There are so many variables producing a 2F L today that removing a motor from service for an electrical repair due only to a high 2F L is a mistake. It is quite possibly an expensive one. The best thing you could hope for is that the repair facility will call back asking &amp;ldquo;what do you want done?&amp;rdquo; to this perfectly good motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Resistance to ground or megger testing is all we need.&amp;rdquo; I find this statement hard to believe. How many times as an electrician have we been nervous restarting a tripped motor after verifying with our trusty Megger that, &amp;ldquo;The motor is fine.&amp;rdquo; The fact is, numerous reasons can exist which causes a motor to trip that will not be seen by a Megger, such as a turn-to-turn short. Breakdown in the insulation between individual turns of a winding can occur inside a stator slot or at the end turn and be completely isolated from ground. Phase-to-phase shorts can occur the same way. If these faults are left unattended, they can result in rapid deterioration of the winding, potentially ending in a complete motor replacement. Restarting of a motor that has tripped should be considered only after these faults have been factored out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Troubleshooting an electric motor that is suspected to have an electrical problem should not result in the statement, &amp;ldquo;The motor is fine.&amp;rdquo; Although someone with years of experience and tons of credibility may be able to get away with such a simple statement, most electricians won&amp;rsquo;t find the same positive response from their supervisor, engineer or plant manager. To confidently report the electrical condition of a motor and ensure that your recommendation is taken seriously, there are six areas of interest known as fault zones that must be looked at during the troubleshooting effort. Missing any of these zones could result in missing the problem and losing credibility in our skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The six electric fault zones are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Power quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Power circuit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Insulation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Stator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	5. Rotor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	6. Air gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power quality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Power quality has recently been thrust in the limelight by utility deregulation and the popularity of AC and DC drives. With deregulation, competition among utilities has heightened the concern of penalties from high distortion levels. The variable frequency drives (VFDs) and other non-linear loads can significantly increase the distortion levels of voltage and current. How can this distortion be minimized? What equipment is required, and is the concern purely financial or is equipment at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what we are really talking about when we speak of power quality problems. Voltage and current harmonic distortion, voltage spikes, voltage unbalance and power factor are a few of the many concerns when discussing power quality. Although all of these are important, we will focus on just a few, beginning with harmonic distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harmonic distortion always sounds like such an in-depth concept. It becomes more elementary if you break it down to the basic fundamentals. The most common reference in this topic is Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). THD is the ratio of the root-mean-square of the harmonic content to the root-mean-square value of the fundamental quantity, expressed as a percent of the fundamental. Quite simply, it is the RMS value of the signal with the line frequency (fundamental) removed. A perfect 60-hertz (Hz) sine wave would have 0 percent THD. So anything other then the fundamental line frequency (60 Hz) would be considered a harmonic distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Common non-linear (switching) loads include computers, florescent lighting and variable frequency drives (VFDs) as mentioned previously. The presence of harmonics in a distribution system results in excessive heat from the increased current demands. A load designed to pull 100 amps at full load may draw now 120 amps if the harmonic distortion is high. This additional current can lead to insulation damage and possibly a catastrophic failure. Excessive zero sequence harmonics will collect back at the transformer, leading to overload and possible failure. These high zero sequence currents return to the source through the neutral bus, and, if excessive, can generate substantial heat and even fires. In an effort to avoid such catastrophic events, many companies are modifying their distribution systems. Installing k-transformers, designed to handle the larger loads generated by harmonics, and increasing the mil size of their neutral to accommodate larger current levels are two popular activities. Though these efforts do nothing to diminish the harmonics, they do reduce the failure risk. Removing the harmonics requires the installation of filtering mechanisms, such as zero sequence filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the newer VFDs that utilize IGBTs can exceed line voltage by a tremendous amount in less than a microsecond. Older Class B insulation systems have low tolerance for this rapid rise time and can fail very quickly. Motors designed for inverter duty are highly recommended when utilizing drives. Excessive cable length between the drive and the motor can create a high impedance mismatch that contributes to high voltage spikes at the motor connection box. The drive manufacturer will normally specify the correct cable distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General guidelines as stated in Table 3.3.1 of IEEE 519-1992, recommend less than 5 percent voltage THD for systems operating at less than 69 kilovolts. They further recommend the individual harmonic voltage distortion to be less than 3 percent. Figure 1 shows an example of unacceptable levels of voltage distortion. These high harmonic levels can be seen on the voltage signal as pulses riding the fundamental frequency (figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="250" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel1.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	High fifth and seventh harmonics indicate the presence of a 6 pulse drive influence on the distribution system. Each of the individual harmonics should be less than 3 percent of the fundamental per IEEE 519-1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="277" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel2.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 2 shows a fundamental 60-hertz voltage signal with 6 pulses occurring throughout each sine wave. This resulted from an unfiltered 6 pulse drive connected to the distribution system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power circuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is a Power circuit? The power circuit refers to all the conductors and connections that exist from the point at which the testing starts through to the connections at the motor. This can include circuit breakers, fuses, contactors, overloads, disconnects and lug connections. A 1994 demonstration project on industrial power distribution systems found that connectors and conductors were the source of 46 percent of the faults reducing motor efficiency. Many times a motor, although initially in perfect health, is installed into a faulty power circuit. This causes problems like harmonics, voltage imbalances, current imbalances, etc. As these problems become more severe, the horsepower rating of your motor drops, causing temperatures to increase and insulation damage to occur. This motor is replaced many times and the failure cycle begins again. As seen in Figure 3, high resistance connections resulting in voltage imbalances will reduce the horsepower rating significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="201" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel3.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; Reference: NEMA Standards MG 1-14.35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One method of detecting high resistance connections is by performing phase-to-phase resistance testing. On a three-phase motor, the three resistance measurements should be nearly identical. If all three reading are exactly the same, there would be a 0 percent resistive imbalance. As one or more phases develop a high resistance the resistive imbalance increases, indicating a fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the fault mechanisms that cause high resistance connections are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Corroded terminals&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Loose cables&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Loose bus bars&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Corroded fuse clips&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Corroded contacts&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Open leads&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Different size conductors&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Dissimilar metals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="166" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel4.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 4 shows three different resistance test points which can be used to determine the actual location of the high resistance connection. Position X is upstream of the fuses. If the resistive imbalance is still high, you may want to move to Position Y, downstream of the contactor. If the imbalance is still evident at Position Y, testing at the motor connection box, Position Z, will isolate the motor from the power circuit and determine which is the problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insulation Condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This refers to the insulation between the windings and ground. High temperatures, age, moisture and dirt contamination all lead to shortened insulation life. It has been said that if plants would just use the space heaters available to keep the insulation dry, then doubling the life of our motors would not be out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Insulation systems today are better than ever and are able to handle higher and higher temperatures without significant reduction in life. However, we are still finding ways to destroy our insulation much earlier than should be expected. Keep in mind that although insulation is many times involved in a failure, this fault zone is heavily influenced by other problems. The power circuit for one can heavily influence the insulation. If a high resistance connection exists upstream of the motor, which develops better than a 5 percent voltage imbalance, and we continue to run the motor at its normal horsepower rating, we will see a shortened insulation life. Reverse sequence currents developing rotating magnetic fields in the opposite direction will not only reduce the torque capability, but can allow the temperature to rise out of control and exceed even the 150-degree Celsius limit on your Class F insulation systems. Was the insulation system the real cause of the motor failure or was it just a symptom? It is easy to diagnose the evident insulation failure as the fault mechanism but it will happen again with a different motor if the problem is not fixed. Then what will the explanation be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Again, testing with a Megger is not going to tell you everything, but it is a good start when it comes to insulation testing. Something that people often overlook when it comes to the IEEE ( Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) limits on resistance to ground is the reference to 40 degrees C. Simply Megger testing with no regard to temperature will result in resistance to ground readings, which swing heavily from high to low readings, depending on the temperature of the windings. Temperature correcting the readings will not only meet the IEEE testing requirements, it will give a much better trend as seen in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="211" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel5.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We must realize that moisture contamination may cause the temperature corrected reading to be invalid. Ensure the heaters are energized when the motor is not running to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An insulation test that has fallen out of the spotlight is the Polarization Index test. Applying a constant DC voltage, in the form of a Megger test, for a period of 10 minutes will result in a gradual increase in the resistance to ground (RTG) reading. This is a result of charging the insulation system, much like a capacitor, which causes a reduction in the absorption current. Per ohms law, I (current) = V (voltage) / R (resistance). Therefore, the reduction of this absorption current must result in an increase in the resistance. If we take the 10-minute RTG and divide it by the one-minute RTG, a value of 2.0 or higher is considered acceptable by IEEE. Unfortunately, motors with unstable insulation systems can give values close to or greater then a 2.0, but still be defective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="203" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel6.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Figure 6, when the 10-minute reading (approximately 600 megohms) is divided by the one-minute reading (approximately 300 megohms), the result is 1.94. This nearly meets the IEEE specification as a good insulation system, and would probably be accepted in the field. You can see, however, that this insulation system is very unstable. &lt;strong&gt;Always look at the PI Profile and not just the index.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A limiting factor about DC resistance to ground testing is that the DC signal will many times not give the best evaluation of the true insulation condition. The insulation on a motor is a natural dielectric material. Therefore, it is a poor conductor of DC. This is good because you don&amp;rsquo;t want excessive leakage to ground, but bad in that an insulation system in a degraded condition may take a bit longer to be identified using a DC signal or Megger. AC, however, does not allow the dielectric to charge and will pass through the dielectric much easier. This is good because it allows the use of an AC signal to give much earlier indications of insulation degradation and bad because it can be destructive, as with an AC Hi-Pot. Low-voltage capacitance to ground tests, however, are non-destructive and very good early indicators of degradation modes in your insulation systems. These values will be read in pico farads (pF) and can be effectively trended over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stator Condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What is a Stator? When we mention the stator, we are referencing the DC or 3-phase AC windings, insulation between the turns of the winding, solder joints between the coils, and the stator core or laminations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the common faults occurring with motor windings is a turn-to-turn fault. This occurs when the insulation between two turns in the same coil breaks down and reduces the coil&amp;rsquo;s ability to produce a balanced magnetic field. Unbalanced magnetic fields result in vibration, which can then cause degradation of the insulation as well as bearing failures. Localized heating around the short can also spread to other coils, resulting in a coil-to-coil short. Excessive heating will eventually not only destroy the motor windings, but will also damage the insulation between the laminations of the stator core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another fault that can occur with motor windings is a phase-to-phase fault. This results from the insulation breaking down between two separate phases, usually lying adjacent to each other in the same slot. A higher difference in voltage potential tends to make this fault accelerate very quickly. Slot paper is installed between different phases in the same slot to reduce the opportunity for leakage between phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A turn-to-turn or a phase-to-phase short can occur many times without resulting in an immediate ground fault. Because of this, testing with just a Megger for preventive maintenance or following a motor trip may not identify the fault. This could cause a small winding fault to develop into a major catastrophic failure. Permanent core damage may necessitate replacing an entire motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Testing of the stator can be done by connecting directly at the motor as well as connecting at the MCC. During the test, high-frequency AC signals are sent into the motor. These signals produce magnetic fields around the windings which should be matched between phases. The inductance measurement for each phase is then compared to the other phases and calculated into an inductive imbalance. This imbalance minus the influence of the rotor is used to compare the ability of each of the phases to produce a balanced magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also during a test, DC signals are sent into the motor. From these signals the actual resistance of the winding or windings is measured. The three resistance readings of a three-phase induction motor are compared and calculated to produce a resistive imbalance. If this imbalance exceeds a predetermined level, then high-resistance connections may exist in the solder joints between coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are two basic types of stator winding configurations. The first is wye (or &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo;) connected and the second is delta connected. To more fully understand what the inductance readings are telling you, a simple understanding of the winding configuration can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img height="215" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel7.gif" width="300" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	A &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; configuration winding with a turn-to-turn short will result in two low-inductance readings and one high-inductance reading, when looking at phase-to-phase inductance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img height="212" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel8.gif" width="300" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Figure 8 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A delta configuration winding with a turn-to-turn short will result in one low-inductance reading and two high-inductance readings, when looking at phase-to-phase inductance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rotor Condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This refers to the rotor bars, the rotor laminations and the end rings of the rotor. In the 1980s, a joint effort between EPRI and General Electric showed that 10 percent of motor failures were due to the rotor. The rotor, although a small percentage of the motor problems, can influence other fault zones to fail. When a motor is started with a broken or cracked rotor bar, intense heat is generated around the vicinity of the break. This can spread to other rotor bars and destroy the insulation around the nearby laminations. It can also affect other parts of the motor. What is just a few millimeters away from the rotor? The stator! Stator insulation can&amp;rsquo;t hold up to the intense heat developed by the broken rotor bar and will eventually fail. Unfortunately, many times broken rotor bars are not easily seen without technology and it may be missed as the root cause of failure. This will result in a motor rewind, and replacement of bearings, but not a rotor repair. When the motor returns to service, it has the same problem all over again, just with new insulation to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One method of testing the rotor condition is the Rotor Influence Check (RIC). The RIC is a test performed on AC induction, synchronous and wound rotor motors which illustrates the magnetic coupling between the rotor and stator. This relationship indicates the condition of the rotor and air gap within the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Rotor Influence Check is performed by rotating the rotor in specific increments (determined by the number of poles) over a single pole group, and recording the change in inductance measurements for each phase of the 3-phase motor. For proper resolution, 18 inductance measurements per pole group are recommended. To determine the number of poles in a motor, use the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;F = NP / 120 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;F &lt;/strong&gt;= Line Frequency (normally 60 hertz in the U.S.)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;N &lt;/strong&gt;= Speed of the motor in RPM&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; = Number of poles&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Recalculated: &lt;strong&gt;P = 7200 / RPM &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Example: A motor with name plate RPM = 1780 would have how many poles?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		P = 7200 / 1780&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		= &lt;strong&gt;4 poles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without historical data, a RIC must be performed to provide any information about the standard squirrel cage induction rotor. Faults such as broken rotor bars or damaged laminations can exist even if the balance of inductance is low. If you are basing the decision to perform a RIC only on how high the balance of inductance is on the baseline test, you could be overlooking late stages of rotor bar defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="196" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel9.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Figure 9 shows the expected inductance changes for a rotor with broken rotor bars. Note the erratic inductance values at the peak of the sine waves for each phase. Broken rotor bars cause a skewing in the field flux generated by and around the rotor bars. A normal rotor would have no skewing or erratic inductance patterns, as seen in Figure 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="154" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel10.gif" width="300" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rotor / Stator Relationship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This relationship references the air gap between the rotor and stator. If this air gap is not evenly distributed around the 360 degrees of the motor, uneven magnetic fields can be produced. These magnetic imbalances can cause movement of the stator windings, resulting in winding failure, and electrically induced vibration, resulting in bearing failure. A faulty relationship between the rotor and stator is also called an eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="166" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel11.gif" width="175" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first type is called static eccentricity. Figure 11 and Figure 12 show an example of what static eccentricity looks like, physically and inductively. This type of eccentricity is caused by problems like a misaligned endbell or the shaft sitting low in the bearing. The physical result is that the shaft is always in the same place out of the electric center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="162" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel12.gif" width="300" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inductive result is the variation in peaks of the sine wave as seen in Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="174" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel13.gif" width="175" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second type of eccentricity is called dynamic eccentricity. This results when the rotor does not stay in one place but is allowed to move within the space of the stator as seen in Figure 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The inductive result is the movement of all three inductance values up or down, depending on which phase is closest to the rotor at a given degree rotation. This is seen in Figure 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="169" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_bethel14.gif" width="350" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the term &amp;ldquo;The motor is fine&amp;rdquo; is just not enough to ensure that we are taken seriously and that a true assessment of the motor health has been performed. If the decision is up to you as to what to do in a troubleshooting or diagnostic situation, look at the whole picture. If at all possible, do not make a quick decision. Break the system down into its individual fault zones, test each fault zone completely with every technology available to you, and finally make your recommendations written or verbal using the terminology used in fault zone analysis to express your confidence and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Opportunities for electric motor markets in Russia, Ukraine</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;While old and outdated equipment is undermining the competitiveness of the Russian and Ukrainian manufacturing sectors, at the same time it is creating considerable opportunity for replacement sales. However, with only a few companies capable of investing in new equipment, Russian and Ukrainian electric motors suppliers may be forced to consider extending their product portfolios, as a route to supporting market share while better responding to customer needs. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan (http://www.motors.frost.com) estimates that revenues in the Russian electric motors market will rise to US$1,456.2 million in 2012, while the Ukrainian electric motors market will expand to US$287.8 million over the same period. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;"A substantial number of Russian and Ukrainian manufacturing companies are currently working with equipment that, in Western Europe or North America, would be considered obsolete," said Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan Research Manager Richard &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Tamworth&lt;/st1:place&gt;. "As a result, most suppliers of electric motors to the Russian and Ukrainian markets expect the replacement cycle to intensify in the next few years, as many companies face the problem of not being able to operate if they do not buy new manufacturing systems or at the very least, new motors to drive their old ones." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;However, despite both the optimism of suppliers and a broader industry recognition that relatively obsolete equipment is hampering their competitiveness in the global markets, only a few Russian and Ukrainian manufacturers, for example those connected to the oil trade, actually possess the resources to invest in the modernization of their production facilities. Many companies lack the capital to update their facilities as their sales are low, their production capacities are often severely underutilized and their margins poor. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;"Although production companies realize they are using outdated equipment, many of them do not have the budget required to renew their production facilities. This lack of investment may prove to be one of the biggest setbacks for the Russian and Ukrainian motors markets, and perhaps their economies in general," said &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Tamworth&lt;/st1:place&gt;. "Despite the gradual, if inconsistent improvement in the economic situation in these countries, many manufacturers are still obliged to repair existing equipment and motors and plan to buy new ones only when necessary." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;The inability or unwillingness of manufacturers to invest in new equipment has a number of more strategic ramifications. The overall quality or technology requirements of the Russian and Ukrainian markets are, typically, relatively low. Inevitably, companies with limited financial resources tend to focus on the basic configuration of electric motors. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;"As a generic marketing strategy, Russian and Ukrainian electric motor suppliers should therefore consider offering comprehensive product portfolios where a customer has several component options, mixing ultra-low cost basics, with more advanced, perhaps imported options," said &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Tamworth&lt;/st1:place&gt;. "This will allow them to better accommodate widely varying customer needs and secure significant competitive advantage." &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Drives at Work - 10 Benefits that Adjustable-Speed AC Drives Provide Your Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Adjustable speed drives are used in any application in which there is mechanical equipment powered by motors. The drives provide extremely precise electrical motor control, so that motor speeds can be ramped up and down, and maintained, at speeds required; doing so utilizes only the energy required, rather than having a motor run at constant (fixed) speed and utilizing an excess of energy.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Since motors consume a majority of the energy produced, the control of motors, based on demands of loads, increases in importance, as energy supplies become ever more strained. Additionally, your plantâs motors can realize a 25- 70-percent energy savings via use of motor controllers. Despite these benefits, the majority of motors continue to be operated without drives.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Here are 10 additional benefits users realize when operating motors with drives:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;1) Controlled starting current:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;When an AC motor is started "across the line," it takes as much as seven to eight times the motor full-load current to start the motor and load. This current flexes the motor windings and generates heat, which will, over time, reduce the longevity of the motor. An adjustable speed &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:Street w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:address w:st="on"&gt;AC Drive&lt;/st1:address&gt;&lt;/st1:Street&gt; starts a motor at zero frequency and voltage. As the frequency and voltage "build," it "magnetizes" the motor windings, which typically takes 50 to 70 percent of the motor full-load current. Additional current above this level is dependent upon the connected load, the acceleration rate and the speed being accelerated, too. The substantially reduced starting current extends the life of the AC motor, when compared to starting across the line. The customer payback is less wear and tear on the motor (motor rewinds), and extended motor life.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;2) Reduced power line disturbances:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Starting an AC motor across the line, and the subsequent demand for seven to eight times the motor full-load current, places an enormous drain on the power distribution system connected to the motor. Typically, the supply voltage sags, with the amplitude of the sag being dependent on the size of the motor and the capacity of the distribution system. These voltage sags can cause sensitive equipment connected on the same distribution system to trip offline due to the low voltage. Items such as computers, sensors, proximity switches and contactors are voltage sensitive and, when subjected to a large AC motor line started nearby, can drop out. Using an adjustable speed &lt;st1:Street w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:address w:st="on"&gt;AC Drive&lt;/st1:address&gt;&lt;/st1:Street&gt; eliminates this voltage sag, since the motor is started at zero voltage and ramped up.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;3) Lower power demand on start:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;If power is proportional to current times voltage, then power needed to start an AC motor across the line is significantly higher than with an adjustable speed AC drive. This is true only at start, since the power to run the motor at load would be equal regardless if it were fixed speed or variable speed. The issue is that some distribution systems are at their limit, and demand factors are placed on industrial customers, which charges them for surges in power that could rob other customers or tax the distribution system during peak periods. These demand factors would not be an issue with an adjustable speed AC drive.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;4) Controlled acceleration:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;An adjustable speed AC drive starts at zero speed and accelerates smoothly on a customer-adjustable ramp. On the other hand, an AC motor started across the line is a tremendous mechanical shock both for the motor and connected load. This shock will, over time, increase the wear and tear on the connected load, as well as the AC motor. Some applications, such as bottling lines, canât be started with motors across the line (with product on the bottling line), but must be started empty to prevent breakage. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;5) Adjustable operating speed:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Use of an adjustable speed AC drive enables optimizing of a process, making changes in a process, allows starting at reduced speed, and allows remote adjustment of speed by programmable controller or process controller. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;6) Adjustable torque limit:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Use of an adjustable speed AC drive can protect machinery from damage, and protect the process or product (because the amount of torque being applied by the motor to the load can be controlled accurately). An example would be a machine jam. With an AC motor connected, the motor will continue to try to rotate until the motor's overload device opens (due to the excessive current being drawn as a result of the heavy load). An adjustable speed AC drive, on the other hand can be set to limit the amount of torque so the AC motor never exceeds this limit.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;7) Controlled stopping:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Just as important as controlled acceleration, controlled stopping can be important to reduce mechanical wear and tear â due to shocks to the process or loss of product due to breakage.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;8) Energy savings:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Centrifugal fan and pump loads operated with an adjustable speed AC drive reduce energy consumption. Centrifugal fans and pumps follow a variable torque load profile, which has horsepower proportional to the cube of speed and torque varying proportional to the square of speed. As such, if the speed of the fan is cut in half, the horsepower needed to run the fan at load is cut by a factor of eight (one-half to the third power equals one-eighth). Using a fixed speed motor would require some type of mechanical throttling device, such as a vane or damper; but the fact remains that the motor would still be running full load and full speed (full power). Energy savings can be sufficient to pay back the capitalized cost in a matter of a couple of years (or less), depending on the size of the motor.&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;9) Reverse operation:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Using an adjustable speed AC drive eliminates the need for a reversing starter, since the output phases to the motor can be electronically changed without any mechanical devices. The elimination of a reversing starter eliminates its maintenance cost and reduces panel space.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;10) Elimination of mechanical drive components:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt; &lt;FONT class=bodytextspaced&gt;Using an adjustable speed AC drive can eliminate the need for expensive mechanical drive components such as gearboxes. Because the AC drive can operate with an infinite variable speed, it can deliver the low or high speed required by the load, without a speed-increasing or reduction device between the motor and load. This eliminates maintenance costs, as well as reducing floor-space requirements.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;FONT class=subtitle2&gt;About the author:&lt;U&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Siemens offers line of energy-efficient industrial motors </title>
            <description>Siemens Energy &amp;amp; Automation Inc. recently introduced three new lines of AC motors designed to meet or exceed NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) standards. Offered in aluminum and cast-iron frame configurations, these motors include high efficiency and industry-leading NEMA Premium efficient designs to help motor users lower energy costs and extend service life. The unique die-cast copper rotor and special stator designs provide the added efficiency of these motors. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The three new product lines include general-purpose die-cast aluminum, general-purpose cast iron and severe-duty cast-iron frame motors for use in a wide variety of industrial applications. Siemens die-cast aluminum frame motors have been developed to provide a high degree of mounting flexibility for general purpose applications such as air handling, conveyors, pumps and compressors. Cast-iron frame motors are available for general-purpose and severe-duty applications. A definite-purpose version, exceeding the demanding requirements of IEEE Standard 841, also is available for durability and energy efficiency in critical petroleum, chemical and paper processing environments. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSiemens is committed to providing our customers with the finest technology available to help lower operating costs through superior motor performance,â said Anne Cooney, vice president of Siemensâ Power Conversion Division. âWe are making a multi-million-dollar investment over the next few years to grow our NEMA motor business in North America. The features, functionality, operating efficiency and service life that our products provide, will only translate to benefits for our distributors, OEMs and end-users.â 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Energy, motor-driven equipment accounts for 64 percent of the electricity consumed in the U.S. industrial sector, and within the nationâs most energy-intensive industries, motor systems consume approximately 290 billion kWh per year. 
&lt;P&gt;âSiemens has more than 14 decades of motor design experience, and our latest NEMA motor innovations will provide significant energy and cost savings to these industries,â said John Caroff, Siemens marketing manager for low-voltage motors. âThese savings can be realized simply by using energy-efficient equipment and sound energy management practices.â 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All three lines of Siemens motors are available in either high-efficiency or NEMA Premium ultra-efficient designs, offering ratings up to 10 percent higher than NEMA Premium standards, to help users significantly reduce facility energy costs. For example, a 5 percent efficiency gain over a 20 horsepower motorâs 20-year life can yield $12,500 in energy savings. With tens to hundreds of motors in a single plant, the savings realized through added motor efficiency can have a significant impact on a companyâs profitability. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The new motors offer unique benefits through:

            <title>The right motor saves energy, money</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the Reliability Forum department of Reliable Plant magazine, suppliers provide their insights to a question posed by editor Paul V. Arnold. This issue, the call went out to manufacturers of power transmission products. They were asked: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;âWhat can a plant do to reduce its energy costs associated with electric motors?â &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Baldor Electric Company &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This reply came from John Malinowski, the product manager for AC and DC motors at Baldor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThere are several things you can do to cut your energy costs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFirst, the biggest gains in efficiency come from âright-sizingâ the motor to the application. A recent survey on motors by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) found that 55 percent of the motors installed in facilities were oversized. The âsweet spotâ for peak motor efficiency is 80 to 100 percent of full load. At less than this, efficiency falls off, as does power factor. So, right-size the motor and use one thatâs rated as Premium efficient by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=175 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_baldor.jpg" width=228&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Baldor advises you to select the right &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;motor size for the application and to &lt;BR&gt;seek one with a Premium rating.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSecond, use adjustable-speed drives, especially for variable torque loads such as fans and pumps. Energy savings in excess of 50 percent are possible here. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThird, look at the machine for productivity and mechanical gains. Select the most efficient fans and pumps and use efficient gearing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFinally, you can reduce costs by having the right information. The Baldor Energy Savings Tool (BE$T) makes it easy for you to see what the savings are by switching to a premium-efficiency motor and/or adding an adjustable-speed drive. This software program compares the energy-saving potential between motors and drives with various energy-efficiency ratings and then selects the best choice for overall savings. BE$T also can be used in conjunction with a PDA to conduct a plant motor survey. Information is also available from the United States Department of Energy through the Energy Star program and the Industrial Technologies program. The DoE has a fantastic Internet site (&lt;A href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/industry"&gt;www.eere.energy.gov/industry&lt;/A&gt;).â &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;NEMA&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This reply came from the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, a trade association representing nearly 430 companies: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLook at the motorâs total cost. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âU.S. motor manufacturers sell products that exceed the minimum efficiency requirements set by federal legislation. These motors are slightly more costly to purchase, but yield significant additional savings over the life of the product, with a better return on investment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMany motor specifiers at industrial plants commonly look only at first-cost options and do not weigh the costs and benefits over time of a completely efficient system. This is a challenge that American manufacturing plants must overcome if potential efficiency gains and subsequent energy savings are to be fully realized. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=151 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200603_nema.jpg" width=222&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NEMA says plants should examine the total&lt;BR&gt;life-cycle cost of an electric motor, as &lt;BR&gt;opposed to purely its product price.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âElectric motor systems currently account for 23 percent of all U.S. energy use and 70 percent of manufacturing electricity consumption, presenting one of the largest opportunities for energy conservation and efficiency. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âManufacturing members of NEMA now offer NEMA Premium motors built to a higher efficiency standard. The NEMA Premium label helps you identify products that optimize motor system efficiency, reduce electrical power consumption and costs, and improve system reliability.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How to maximize motor life</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial electric motor manufacturers provide their insights to a question posed by Reliable Plant. &amp;nbsp;They were asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;In your opinion, what are the keys to maximizing the service life of industrial electric motors?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle5"&gt;&lt;img align="right" height="194" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200511_Reli-Forum-Baldor_superE.jpg" width="250" /&gt;Baldor Electric &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This reply comes from John Malinowski, the product marketing manager for AC and DC motors at Baldor Electric Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of the keys to maximizing life in electric motors is to learn from your premature failures. Partner with a service shop and learn from the types of failures they see and document. Then, take actions to prevent these failures from happening to your other motors in similar applications. This may involve changing your maintenance procedures. Perhaps you need to grease more or less, or use a more compatible grease. Perhaps you need to identify voltage supply problems (for instance, if you have bearing fluting from an adjustable speed drive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Second, check to see if contamination and water are getting into the motors. If either one of these is an issue, do you have the right enclosure? Does the enclosure need a higher level of environmental protection? If so, look into severe duty, IEEE 841 or washdown motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Finally, if you want to maximize service life, empower the plant maintenance and purchasing folks to buy better motors that will last longer and reduce energy consumption for years. Buying the lowest-cost item doesn&amp;rsquo;t always equate to the lowest life cost. Studies show that a motor&amp;rsquo;s purchase price is only 2 percent of its total life-cycle cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="subtitle5"&gt;Emerson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This reply comes from Jim Bryan, the product service group manager for Emerson Motor Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="right" height="202" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200511_Reli-Forum-Emerson.jpg" width="250" /&gt;&amp;ldquo;To maximize motor life, focus on proper lubrication and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In regard to proper lubrication, bearings must receive not only a good, quality lubricant but the correct quantity at the proper intervals in order to obtain optimum life and reliability. Under- or over-greasing can be detrimental to reliability. Under-greasing does not provide the lubricant at the time it is needed, resulting in bearing wear or heat damage. Over-greasing can damage shields or significantly increase operating temperatures due to fluid shear friction. This reduces the grease&amp;rsquo;s lubricating capability. Oil-lubricated bearings must have the correct type and viscosity of oil for the same reasons stated previously. Closely follow manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s recommendations for lubrication types, amounts and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In regard to temperature, this is the nemesis of electric motors. Overload, under-voltage, over-voltage, unbalanced voltage and improper ventilation can all work to increase the motor&amp;rsquo;s operating temperature. The overused rule of thumb is that motor life is cut in half for every increase of 10 degrees Celsius. Although the rule&amp;rsquo;s accuracy may be in question, it illustrates the point well. Any care given to mitigate the operating temperature will be rewarded with increased life and reliability. And, don&amp;rsquo;t make the mistake of increasing the rated capacity of a motor applied in a high ambient temperature environment to accommodate the winding temperature increase. Particularly on enclosed machines, this could result in unacceptable bearing operating temperatures, leading to early demise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Helping motors keep their cool</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=214 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/backup_200511_App-Reli-Motor.jpg" width=175 align=right border=1&gt;An electric motorâs insulation system separates electrical components from each other, preventing short circuits and, thus, winding burnout and failure. Insulationâs major enemy is heat, so itâs important to be sure to keep the motor within temperature limits. There is a rule of thumb that says a 10-degree Celsius (18-degree Fahrenheit) rise reduces the insulationâs useful life by half, while a 10Â° C (18Â° F) decrease doubles the insulationâs life. This implies that if you can keep a motor cool enough, the winding will last forever. However, that thinking ignores factors such as moisture, vibration, chemicals and abrasives in the air that also attack insulation systems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The real issue is at what temperature the motor windings are designed to operate for a long and predictable insulation life â 20,000 hours or more. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) sets temperature standards based on thermal classes, the most common being A, B, F and H. The table above provides a summary. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Class B or Class F insulation systems are usually used in todayâs industrial-duty NEMA âT frameâ motors. Many manufacturers also design their motors to operate cooler than their thermal class might allow. For example, a motor might have Class F insulation but a Class B temperature rise. This gives an extra thermal margin. Class H insulation systems are seldom found in general-purpose motors but rather in special designs for very heavy-duty use, high ambient temperature or high altitudes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Class A insulation, while not used on todayâs industrial-duty motors, was standard on industrial âU frameâ motors built in the 1960s and earlier. Because Class A insulation has such a low temperature rating, older motors were required to have far lower maximum temperatures. This accounts for the perception among many long-time motor users that modern motors ârun hot.â In fact, they do when compared with older motors, but modern insulation systems are so much better that the reliability and durability of new motors are equal to or better than older-design motors. Plus, better insulation systems allow motor manufacturers to put more horsepower in a smaller package. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Determining Correct Operation &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though many people believe they can judge a motorâs operating characteristics by feeling its surface, this isnât a very effective method. Design ratings for temperature apply to the hottest spot within the motorâs windings, not how much of that heat is transferred to the motorâs surface. Unless you have intimate knowledge of a specific motor modelâs design â including benchmark lab readings of heat runs that show ânormalâ surface temperatures for that specific model in exact locations on the frame â a motorâs âskin temperatureâ provides little, if any, evidence of whatâs going on inside. This is true even if temperature measurement methods far more sophisticated than the human touch are used. In addition, for safety reasons, itâs unwise to touch operating motors anyway. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Specifying motors with inherent overload protectors, thermostats or resistive temperature devices, or installing similar protection in motor controls, can help ensure that a motor is taken off-line before winding damage occurs. Motor protection of one sort or another is advisable in almost any application. A common and reliable field test for motor heating involves checking the motorâs amperage draw with a clamp-style ammeter. Use this to confirm that actual amps are less than or equal to the nameplate rating. A precise test for winding temperature is the resistance method. This involves careful measurements with sensitive equipment, calculations and several hours of time. Procedures to conduct such tests can be found in technical manuals. Or, contact your motor manufacturer. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle5&gt;Common-sense Precautions &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sometimes a motor overheats because of a manufacturing or design defect. But far more often, overheating can be traced to misapplication. Overloading is the leading cause. This could take the form of using an undersized motor, a situation that may become more common as concern for energy efficiency puts the emphasis on eliminating oversized motors. Use an 80 percent loading as your guide. Most electric motors reach their peak efficiency at that load, and a comfortable overload margin remains. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Other common causes of overloading include a load seizing up or misalignment of power transmission linkages. Plus, unanticipated changes in environment, aging of equipment, misuse and other factors can subject the motor to stresses for which it was not intended. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Environmental conditions that can result in motor overheating include high ambients (especially look at the near vicinity of the motor for any heat-generating device) and high altitudes (above 3,300 feet or 1,005.84 meters, where the thin air has less cooling potential). You might have to derate a motor under these conditions, probably choosing the next size up. Another environmental concern is dirt and fibers, which can clog ventilation openings, coat heat-dissipating surfaces and cause a variety of mechanical problems. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Power supply problems are another overheating cause. Low voltage will result in the motor drawing higher current to deliver the same horsepower, and the higher current means higher winding temperatures. A 10 percent drop in voltage could cause nearly that much rise in temperature. Excessive or sustained high voltage will saturate a motorâs core and lead to overheating, as well. In three-phase motors, phase imbalances can result in high currents and excessive heat, the extreme being the complete loss of voltage in one phase (called single phasing), which, if correct protection is not in place, will result in motor burnout. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Often overlooked as a cause of overheating is the number of start/stop cycles. Itâs not uncommon for a motor at starting to draw five times or more the current it does while running. This accelerates heating dramatically. Though various provisions are made relative to loading and off-time, NEMA essentially limits a three-phase continuous-duty motor to two starts in succession before allowing sufficient time for the motor to stabilize to its maximum continuous operating temperature rating. This is highly dependent on application, so itâs best to check with your motor manufacturer if youâre facing a high-cycle application. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, pay special attention when applying adjustable-speed inverter drives, especially if you are introducing an inverter in a system of older motors. Some additional heating to the motor windings will inevitably occur because of the inverterâs âsynthesizedâ AC waveform. A greater cooling concern involves operating for an extended time at low motor speed, which reduces the flow of cooling air. Modern inverter-duty motors have higher insulation ratings to help alleviate this concern, and the robust insulation systems used in most of todayâs general-purpose industrial motors are also adequate for many applications. In extreme cases, though, a secondary cooling source may be required. &lt;/P&gt;
