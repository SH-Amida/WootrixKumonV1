			<title>'Neoehrlichiosis' internationally diagnosed, successfully treated in patients without immunodeficiency for the first time</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~3/fH6ILsLBvOM/160229082120.htm</link>
			<description>The intercellular bacteria "Candidatus Neoehrlichia", as e.g. Borrelia, can be transferred by ticks. Approx. 4.2 % of indigenous ticks are infected with this rarely explored bacterium which, until today, has been exclusively identified as pathogenic bacterium in patients with an impairment of the immune system, such as in case of leukemia, rheumatism or after organ transplantation. Now, an interdisciplinary team of researchers has succeeded in diagnosing the bacterium in an otherwise healthy female patient with fever of an unknown origin - and treating it successfully.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/fH6ILsLBvOM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Chemists uncover how key agent allows diseases to reproduce</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~3/Q4-UT03Ut00/160128151942.htm</link>
			<description>Chemists have revealed the chemistry behind how certain diseases, from anthrax to tuberculosis, replicate. The key lies in the function of a gene absent in humans, called thyX, and its ability to catalyze the DNA building block thymine. The finding could help drug companies target the chemical reaction, rather than testing millions of compounds, to stop these diseases.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/Q4-UT03Ut00" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>New way to detect human-animal diseases tested in lemurs</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~3/Vs-ALOWPrd0/160127121205.htm</link>
			<description>RNA sequencing is uncovering emerging diseases in wildlife that other diagnostic tests cannot detect. Researchers used a technique called transcriptome sequencing to screen for blood-borne diseases in Madagascar's lemurs, distant primate cousins to humans. The animals were found to be carrying several previously unknown parasites similar to those that cause Lyme disease in humans. The approach could pave the way for earlier, more accurate detection of disease outbreaks that move between animals and people.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/Vs-ALOWPrd0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Sporadic outbreaks of plague among black-tailed prairie dogs is an ideal model for the study of infectious zoonotic disease, say biologists. Plague doesn't usually kill people these days, but it's alive and well among the millions of ground-dwelling rodents of Colorado and other western states, notably the black-tailed prairie dog. They're resilient critters, though: following wholesale destruction of colonies, they seem to repopulate with a vengeance.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/Vtvy6zpyb98" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A theory that our cells have molecular clock processes ticking inside them, that damage DNA by generating mutations continuously throughout life, has just been proven.These clock-like mutational processes could ultimately be responsible for a large proportion of human cancer and contribute to human aging. Two clock-like mutational processes have been found in human cells and the rates at which the two clocks tick in different human cell types have been determined.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/PSMV_2bzWPA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Spontaneous knee effusion, also known as 'water on the knee,' can be a primary symptom of Lyme disease, even when patients do not exhibit a 'bull's eye' rash, another common Lyme disease symptom.

			<description>How can you tell if someone is depressed? The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -- the 'bible' of psychiatry -- diagnoses depression when patients tick off a certain number of symptoms on the DSM checklist. A large-scale quantitative study now shows that some symptoms play a much bigger role than others in driving depression, and that the symptoms listed in DSM may not be the most useful ones.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/ACjbDJeC72I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Ticks have had millions of years to figure out how to bite without triggering their victims' immune response. Proteins in the arachnids' spit evolved to manipulate immune cells so that the bloodsuckers can suck blood and transmit pathogens in peace. But these measures may not always have the desired effect when ticks bite humans, leading to severe allergic reactions, argue infectious disease specialists.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/iIHopgCnnYk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Increasing evidence points to inflammation as source of nervous system manifestations of Lyme disease</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~3/i1Vl6jxNZXI/150416084338.htm</link>
			<description>About 15 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop peripheral and central nervous system involvement, often accompanied by debilitating and painful symptoms. New research indicates that inflammation plays a causal role in the array of neurologic changes associated with Lyme disease. The investigators also showed that the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone prevents many of these reactions.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/i1Vl6jxNZXI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the U.S., some 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually. Thousands also suffer from babesiosis and anaplasmosis, tick-borne ailments that can occur alone or as co-infections with Lyme disease. In our struggle to manage the ever-growing list of tick-borne diseases, we need to understand which animals magnify human disease risk. New results suggest when generalist pathogens emerge, small mammals with large populations and a fast pace of life warrant careful monitoring.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/BfaGRJN-27o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The groundwork has been laid for understanding how variations in immune responses to Lyme disease can contribute to the many different outcomes of this bacterial infection seen in individual patients. "Physicians have recognized for many years that Lyme disease is not a uniform disease process and can vary in outcomes," says the senior author of the report. "Our experiments have linked such differences to specific immune pathways controlled by elements of the immune system, which in turn might help us understand both the good immune processes that clear up the infection and the bad ones that cause injury and prolong symptoms. This could be a big step forward in managing this disease."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/V1qsBlDiU7A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Lone star tick bites are likely the cause of thousands of cases of severe red meat allergies that are plaguing patients in Southeastern United States including Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia and spreading up the Eastern Seaboard along with the deer population. The allergy can cause hives and swelling, as well as broader symptoms of anaphylaxis including vomiting, diarrhea, trouble breathing, and a drop in blood pressure. Persons with the allergy can go into a delayed anaphylactic shock four-six hours after eating red meat.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/d05NnmRv90I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Zoonotic feline tularemia prevented by finding influential geospatial factors</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~3/6giCKBbkXKc/140219124558.htm</link>
			<description>An epidemiologist is helping cats, pet owners and soldiers stay healthy by researching feline tularemia. Researchers have found that a certain combination of climate, physical environment and socio-ecologic conditions are behind tularemia infections among cats in their region. More than 50 percent of all tularemia cases in the U.S. occur in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Francisella tularensis, a bacterium that causes tularemia, commonly circulates among ticks, rabbits and rodents in the wild, but also frequently infects domestic cats. Tularemia is a zoonotic disease that can spread to humans through ticks or insect bites, eating undercooked rabbit meat, close contact with infected animals or even through airborne means. If left untreated, it can cause death in humans and animals.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/6giCKBbkXKc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Lyme disease is often evident by a rash on the skin, but infections do not always produce similar rashes. This can make it difficult to detect the disease early, when antibiotic treatment is most effective. Researchers describe a new mathematical model that captures the interactions between disease-causing bacteria and the host immune response that affect the appearance of a rash and the spread of infection.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/mc2lAJr7Vxg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, hitchhikes in ticks for dissemination to mammalian hosts -- including humans. A new article identifies HrpA, an RNA helicase, as a crucial player in the transmission from ticks to mammals. Scientists have analyzed the molecular function of the HrpA protein and explored its role in the bacterium's complicated life cycle, in particular for transmission of the pathogen.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/mzhju4IXLow" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The bacterial pathogens that cause Lyme disease and syphilis are highly invasive. These pathogens, or spirochetes, can invade the central nervous system and, in the case of syphilis, enter the placenta, causing disease in the unborn child. Researchers now provide new insights into how these spirochetes penetrate tissue barriers. The findings might be used to develop new treatment strategies to help affected patients or even prevent infections.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/hj9-tRO0n-w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Scientists have for the first time traced a novel virus that infected two men from northwestern Missouri in 2009 to populations of ticks in the region, providing confirmation that lone star ticks are carrying the recently discovered virus and humans in the area are likely at risk of infection. There is no treatment available for HRTV. Unlike other tick-borne diseases like Lyme, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, HRTV is a virus and thus does not respond to antibiotics.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/lyme_disease/~4/tQ4Gq9Tkgyo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
