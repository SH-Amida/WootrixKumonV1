            <title>Applying Lean Six Sigma Methodology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/5/27/6873fa37-762e-4c46-8be8-5ca82bc5e300_lean methodology.jpeg" style="width: 326px; height: 283px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;As the name implies, a lean Six Sigma methodology combines the principles of lean manufacturing (lean) with those of Six Sigma. But why would anyone want to do this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of combining lean and Six Sigma methodologies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Does Lean Contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a process of continual improvement based on increasing value for the customer. The objective is to eliminate anything that does not contribute to what a customer is willing to pay for. This puts the focus on eliminating waste and streamlining the process of delivering the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean involves applying a number of principles and methods that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kaizen &amp;ndash; The principle of continuous improvement based on employee suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kanban &amp;ndash; Customer demand &amp;quot;pulls&amp;quot; the product through the production process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TPM &amp;ndash; Total productive maintenance is used to reduce equipment downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TQM &amp;ndash; Total quality management continually improves product and service quality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		5S &amp;ndash; Improving quality and efficiency through cleaning up and getting organized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SMED &amp;ndash; The principles of Single-Minute Exchange of Die reduce the time needed to change a machine or production line to produce a different product.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Poka-yoke &amp;ndash; Used to eliminate the possibility of errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a tool used by businesses to streamline manufacturing and production processes. The main emphasis of lean is on cutting out unnecessary and wasteful step so that only the steps that directly add value to the product remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What Does Six Sigma Contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma is a quantitative method that focuses on improving quality in manufacturing using data collection and measurement, with the goal being to eliminate errors and variation. The result is improved product quality. Six Sigma addresses both the production and design of a product. The two approaches are represented by two acronyms: DMAIC and DMADV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMAIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DMAIC is the Six Sigma acronym for the five steps used to improve an existing process or product. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define the Project &amp;mdash; This is usually a problem to be solved. What are the goals, resources and limits of the project?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure &amp;ndash; Collect data about the current system or process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analyze the Data &amp;mdash; To find the root cause of the error.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improve &amp;ndash; Design and implement changes that will eliminate the error. Some techniques that are used include design of experiments, poka-yoke and standard work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control &amp;ndash; Provide a system that allows monitoring and adjustments to maintain and improve on what was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMADV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		DMADV is the Six Sigma methodology used to improve an existing a product or service, or for the creation of a new product or service. The steps in DMADV are:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Define &amp;ndash; Establish the methods to be used and the goals of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Measure &amp;mdash; Identify characteristics such as those that are critical to quality (CTQ), required capabilities, production process capabilities and limits, and potential risks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analyze &amp;ndash; Develop and test design alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Design &amp;ndash; Select the best alternative, based on customer requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Verify &amp;ndash; Verify the design meets the goals of the project and make adjustments based on feedback and new data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In many ways, the goals of lean and Six Sigma are similar, with lean having a broader scope and Six Sigma primarily focusing on eliminating errors and improving quality. However, both are based on a foundation of having a customer focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Synergism, Working Together in Lean Six Sigma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The differences in lean and Six Sigma are why they work together so well. For example, the two methods have similar goals, but they use different methods for identifying the root cause of waste and errors. Lean looks to optimize the production process. Six Sigma eliminates wastes that result from variations (errors) in the process. This means they can identify different types of deficiencies and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another difference is that lean is more of a bottom-up system, in which ideas for improvements (kaizen suggestions) flow up from the people doing the production work. Six Sigma is more of a top-down method employing experts to collect, analyze and act on data that is collected. This provides different viewpoints that will not only catch problems the other did not notice, but also come up with solutions the other had not considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma methodology is effective because the two methods complement each other, working together to identify errors and waste more efficiently than using just one method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Drawbacks of Lean Six Sigma Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are some possible drawbacks to the lean Six Sigma methodology. One of the most significant is that both lean and Six Sigma involve major changes to the workplace. For example, most lean implementations are not successful because management underestimates the amount of time and effort required to implement and maintain lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In his book &amp;quot;Changing with Lean Six Sigma,&amp;quot; A. Aruleswaran writes, &amp;quot;The most significant challenge is to change people and their mindsets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is not unusual for it to take more than two years to make the changes required just to implement lean. Implementing both lean and Six Sigma together means even greater complexity. If sufficient time and resources are not provided, the likelihood of failure is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s easy to hire consultants and pour resources into lean Six Sigma methodologies, thinking you&amp;#39;ll ensure success that way. While adequate resources must be allocated, the objective is not to spend a lot of money and waste resources. For example, Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa taught that 90 percent of all problems can be solved using simple graphical techniques he called the &amp;quot;seven tools of quality:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cause-and-effects diagrams (fishbone diagram)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Histograms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Check sheets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pareto charts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stratification (flow charts)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Control charts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Scatter diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Achieving the right balance to economically implement lean Six Sigma methodologies is a difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Other Possible Issues with Lean Six Sigma Methodologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At times, lean and Six Sigma may give conflicting answers. A system must be in place to resolve differences and address situations in which conflicting &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; are championed. Babe Ruth&amp;#39;s famous words apply when combining lean and Six Sigma: &amp;quot;The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don&amp;#39;t play together, the club won&amp;#39;t be worth a dime.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, lean Six Sigma methodology can result in using the wrong method for the problem being addressed. For example, Six Sigma is not appropriate for solving small problems that do not involve a significant number of variables. Lean techniques are much more efficient for solving these types of problems. Of course, this is also an advantage of lean Six Sigma methodology because both methods are available, and the best one or a combination of both can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Results of Lean Six Sigma Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the forward to the book &amp;quot;Changing with Lean Six Sigma,&amp;quot; V. S. Pandin writes: &amp;quot;Lean Six Sigma involves working on both the top line (revenue) as well as the bottom line (profits) of the enterprise. The attention to the top line is by being relevant to customer needs (voice of the customer), and the attention to the bottom line is through better quality, improved cycle times and lower costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Applying lean Six Sigma methodology throughout the workplace has a number of positive results, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Both methods bring a focus on customer value and can reinforce each other to achieve a high level of customer focus that delivers value to both the customer and the organization implementing lean Six Sigma methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste is an unnecessary cost. By targeting waste directly, as well as targeting variation and errors, waste is more effectively eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Problems of all types and sizes are brought to light. Root causes are identified, and the problems are solved in an effective and efficient manner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Products and services are delivered virtually defect-free, economically and on time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste elimination, error elimination and a customer focus become the culture of an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Visual Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without clear, effective visual communication, implementing lean Six Sigma methods will be next to impossible. Visual communication using signs and labels delivers necessary information at the physical locations and times when it is needed most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/L9dKqGUqb2Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Best Tools for Implementing Six Sigma</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/8/20/6ca939c1-8570-4a29-ae6a-8d03411eef0c_six-sigma.jpeg" style="width: 295px; height: 285px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The Six Sigma methodology for reducing defects through a disciplined, data-driven approach has shown time and again that, when done well, it can lead to huge savings and increased efficiency. By closely following the define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) system, your manufacturing team has a structure in place to systematically implement operational changes and test them for results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An organization that wants to implement Six Sigma in its manufacturing operations should recognize the immense discipline and oversight required. It&amp;#39;s a cyclical system that can require multiple rotations through the cycle before observable improvements occur. Having the proper systems and tools in place to facilitate Six Sigma can help your organization more effectively follow the DMAIC process, accurately measure your results and maintain any alterations to production. Below are some of the best project management (PM) and business intelligence (BI) tools for Six Sigma methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Project Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Project management tools should be utilized to facilitate each step within the DMAIC process. Depending on your approach, they can be used to outline each of the steps as singular processes or a number of subparts within each step. For example, for Team A, the &amp;quot;define&amp;quot; step might mean simply sitting down and defining the problem, while for Team B, it might work better to include multiple steps under &amp;quot;define,&amp;quot; such as observe operations, individually define, brainstorm a unified definition and simplify the final definition. It all depends on the complexity of your operations and the level of granularity that works best for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With that in mind, the best project management solution for Six Sigma methodology is most likely a lean project management tool that employs Kanban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lean system for project management places an emphasis on the prevention of waste, much like Six Sigma methodology. The goal of a lean system is to create a continuous stream to reduce waste and increase the speed of processes, making it the perfect system to pair with the DMAIC cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanban is a workflow system that was developed by Toyota&amp;#39;s manufacturing plant in Japan to improve processes and timing through a just-in-time system. Essentially, the Kanban approach visualizes tasks via cards on a straight line or in a vertical funnel. This is a great solution to visualize each phase of the DMAIC process as one step flows into the next, creating smoother transitions in each cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While there are a number of viable preventive maintenance (PM) solutions that include the lean system and Kanban workflow, following are a couple of the best solutions to work with Six Sigma methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Trello&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations interested in implementing a PM solution for manufacturing but aren&amp;#39;t sure about the monetary commitment, Trello is a free solution that utilizes Kanban. Because this software is free, it won&amp;#39;t include many of the functions that advanced PM systems have, but its simplicity and intuitive design make it a great option for new users. Employees with access to the system can upload related files and tag them to related tasks for easier access. Trello also offers mobile accessibility so users can update workflows from any location, which is perfect for the hands-on plant manager who wants to keep systems up to date even when away from the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Kanbanery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kanbanery is a Web-based Kanban solution that works under lean methodology with a variety of pricing plans depending on your organization&amp;#39;s needs. The system is very customizable, allowing you to determine how intricate each step of the DMAIC process should be for your plant. In addition to the workflow processes, Kanbanery includes reporting tools that can be used to increase insight into how different portions of the DMAIC cycle are developing. For example, you can analyze how long it takes for improvements to be implemented and if there are ways to expedite the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Business Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having analytical insight from related data sets can assist with every step of the DMAIC cycle. For the &amp;quot;define&amp;quot; phase, having dashboards and visualizations that illustrate current operational levels can help you establish a more accurate definition of the problem. Aggregating and appropriately analyzing data is crucial for accurate measurements, and having access to that data in easily digestible ways is essential to further analyze operations. Improvements should be implemented as quickly and effectively as possible, which can be guided by further data analysis. Finally, you can use real-time data analytics to make sure all changes are properly controlled and measured on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The analysis tools typically used by organizations, like Microsoft Excel, are often too simplistic and may overlook important information. Business intelligence solutions can be integral to the success of your Six Sigma initiatives for a couple of key reasons. One, many of these systems include data-visualization tools that can provide crucial insight into operational efficiency and effectiveness from your existing data sets. In addition, some of these systems also feature warehousing solutions, which are essential for organizations that currently have no effective system in place for recording and storing key data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If your company currently has no data storage solution, you&amp;#39;ll want to invest in a business intelligence system that includes warehousing capabilities. Below is an example of a system that&amp;#39;s great for organizations that currently store their own data, along with a system for companies that have no data storage solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Tableau&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tableau is one of the most trusted and effective data-visualization providers on the market. Its intuitive design and functionality makes it accessible to all users, from information technology professionals to business users. For Six Sigma, two of the most important visualization tools are Pareto charts for measuring defects and histograms for measuring deviation. Both of these tools are included in the Tableau system. The system also incorporates business dashboards for quick access to Six Sigma functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	SAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SAS offers a variety of solutions that can be used independently or in unison with one another. For Six Sigma, two of the most effective solutions would be the data management software and the performance management software. With data management, organizations can store and organize data sets in a way that&amp;#39;s most intuitive for them, enabling easier access to crucial information. Pairing the data management system with the performance management software also lets manufacturers analyze their data for insight into each phase of the DMAIC cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By incorporating any of these business software solutions into your daily operations, your plant can more effectively implement and follow Six Sigma to reduce defects and increase efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/xxHDzzVYoF8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The Benefits of Lean Six Sigma</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/16/43fcb402-dafb-44f4-8942-31d6d3a02595_sixsigmaplant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In a competitive, global marketplace, customers are more attuned to quality craftsmanship than ever before. They are also more likely to value corporate stewardship, especially as it relates to sustainability. In a March 2012 Nielsen survey, two thirds of customers responded that they would prefer to buy products and services from companies that contribute to the good of society, with environmental stewardship highest on the list. Nearly half of the respondents said they would pay more for such products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Industrial facilities can achieve dramatic improvements in both quality and sustainability by adopting a single process methodology: Lean Six Sigma. However, personnel in many enterprises &amp;mdash; from executive decision-makers to plant employees â often misunderstand both the concepts of Lean Six Sigma and the realities of its implementation. In this article, we will look at these issues and make recommendations for how plants can reap substantial rewards from a Lean Six Sigma program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Lean Six Sigma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma is a conceptual framework that, when properly implemented, extends far beyond the plant floor and into every aspect of a company&amp;#39;s business. It combines two of today&amp;#39;s most influential trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improving quality, as measured by eliminating defects and process variation, increasing predictability and consistency, and focusing on those products/processes/services that the customer values most (Six Sigma).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reducing waste, as measured by eliminating or drastically reducing unnecessary motion, transportation, inventory, processing, production and defects (Lean).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma represents a perfect union of two beneficial practices. Although the concept of Lean encourages a sustainable, cost-effective outcome, it does not by itself provide the necessary process-improvement strategies to achieve these goals. Six Sigma is all about process improvement, with benchmarking (measuring to establish performance-improvement targets) and prioritizing (determining which process improvements will yield the greatest results) adding value to the effort. In other words, with Six Sigma, a company can determine exactly how many problems, defects, flaws, inaccuracies, etc., are occurring and then provide a systematic methodology to eradicate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	DMAIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma involves five distinct steps: define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC). Although many facilities pay lip service to these steps, the ones for whom Lean Six Sigma provides the most improvement truly embrace them throughout all levels of operation. DMAIC isn&amp;#39;t a magic recipe for achieving the benefits of Lean Six Sigma as a whole. Rather, it is a formula for achieving the incremental benefits that eventually lead to quality and waste reduction, using a continual feedback loop to refine processes in pursuit of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While Lean and DMAIC may drive improvements on the plant floor, the principles are applicable in every corner of the organization. The excellence that Lean Six Sigma fosters permeates the entire operation, and both customers and employees are happier as a result. This fact is evidenced by the many companies â from accounting firms to human resources agenciesâwho are achieving dramatic results with Lean Six Sigma. These are 100-percent service firms without a single product to design, engineer, build, finish or repair, and yet Lean Six Sigma is meaningful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Keys to Achievement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many companies and facilities, the breakdown of Lean Six Sigma occurs when management or personnel misunderstands its intrinsic nature. Lean Six Sigma isn&amp;#39;t an approach that an organization adopts purely to save money. It also isn&amp;#39;t a sprint or a cookie-cutter solution that works the same way for everyone. Lean Six Sigma requires substantial discipline and governance. In order to prove its effectiveness, it must produce results that can be validated, whether that validation comes from the finance department documenting monetary savings or the service department being flooded with positive customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of dedicated effort and patience in a successful implementation cannot be overstated. A few of the core requirements that are necessary for companies or facilities to succeed with Lean Six Sigma include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations must have a compelling reason for implementing Lean Six Sigma.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Senior management must be 100-percent invested in and committed to achieving Lean Six Sigma. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Companies must be willing to invest in appropriate, qualified resources for the initiative, whether those resources are employees, materials, technologies or a combination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Stakeholders and participants must work together as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Team members must be empowered to carry out initiatives without the need for constant evaluation and approval.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Organizations must commit sufficient time and resources to training, which is crucial to achieving a positive outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		When companies work on their priorities, they should focus not on improvements that create change quickly but rather on those that have the most impact on quality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The feedback loop is pivotal to incremental and long-lasting improvement and cannot be bypassed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Why Lean Six Sigma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If Lean Six Sigma requires so much dedication and effort, why go through it at all? The answer is that the rewards can be truly amazing. Some of the positive improvements that facilities see when adopting this approach include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Value for the Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma leads to improved service, delivery and quality, all of which creates value for customers and drives business to the company&amp;#39;s door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Increased Workforce Productivity and Morale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not only does the process improvement from Lean Six Sigma increase productivity, but surveys show that it also boosts employee attitudes and satisfaction within the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	More Fluid Strategic Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean Six Sigma operations are more nimble and flexible regarding changing conditions, enabling them to adapt more readily to unanticipated changes in the business or economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Stronger Competitive Stance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customers, vendors and partners are drawn to the type of excellence and success that Lean Six Sigma operations exhibit, making these firms more competitive in all aspects of business operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Standards-Driven Achievement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When processes are standardized, personnel training, project management and monitoring, problem-solving and other aspects of corporate operations are simplified and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Better Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When personnel and management aren&amp;#39;t constantly solving problems and/or surmounting challenges, it opens the way for more innovative and imaginative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Healthier Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not only do lean operations save money in terms of reduced waste of all types, but greater customer satisfaction and fewer returns result in higher profitability. Numerous companies have documented annual savings from Lean Six Sigma initiatives that range from $2,000 to $250,000 (and higher) per improvement, and those figures don&amp;#39;t include the added value of increased sales, enhanced reputation and expanded customer goodwill. The U.S. Army reports that its Lean Six Sigma initiatives have resulted in savings approaching $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/phLOIZddvPE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Communicate to Build World-Class Culture</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is the real objective of Lean Six Sigma? When I ask this question, I usually get responses such as increased quality, improved speed, reduced cost, reduced errors and many other tactical improvement measures. Those are all benefits to continuous improvement (CI). The real goal of CI is to build a culture or improve a culture. As Dr. Womack wrote in &lt;em&gt;Lean Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, the fifth principle of lean is culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So what does it mean to build a culture or to enhance the culture? How does a world-class culture behave? A world-class culture has an engrained tendency to seek out, identify and drive improvements at all levels of the organization. It moves from a culture where lean and Six Sigma are something to be done (like a project) to a place where Lean Six Sigma is simply the way things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As you are engaging your CI plan, ask yourself what your culture is like. Are you doing CI or is CI simply the way things are done? This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to figure out, so don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time dwelling on it. Either you are or you aren&amp;#39;t. Either answer is OK. Just recognize where you are and where you are trying to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Part of the equation in building a world-class culture is to engage people at all levels of the organization. Leaders must tie everyone into the plan for the CI process. They must get people involved, ask them for help and support them through the change. In short, leaders must lead them through the process. Communication is the first step to doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have developed your CI plan for the division, plant or department, tell people about it. Share it with those around you and those who work in the processes that will be affected. Tell them what you (with their help) are going to do. In so doing, you are absolutely obligated to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them why you have this plan.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tell them what is in it for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I can&amp;rsquo;t stress these two items enough. If you are going to build a culture and truly reach where you are trying to go, you must get everyone involved and singing from the same sheet of music. You must get them onboard with the plan if they are going to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Too many management teams still employ demand and direct tactics. They use pressure to get things done. While this can be effective, it usually does little to engage the culture or endear the personnel to the organization. Engage and empower your team members if you want to accelerate the velocity of the CI plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another part of the communication process is to post the information on the wall, on the shop floor and wherever you have a facility board. Put the plan, targets, progress and results together in one place. As you can, have communications at that place and talk about it. People want to know how they are doing, what is coming up next and how they are involved. People want to hear about results and plans. They want leaders to point out when things are going well and when things need to be improved or changed. People want to know where they stand. It is the leaders&amp;rsquo; job to have open and honest communications with them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you communicate and post the plan, you are almost ready to start executing. Before you do, however, you also need to make sure that all of this work doesn&amp;rsquo;t become &amp;quot;window dressing.&amp;quot; How are you going to communicate going forward? How are you going to share the wins, challenges and opportunities going forward? How are you going to hold yourself and your team accountable? What are you going to do to keep people fully engaged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not going to tell you the answer, but I will offer some very strong advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Communicate honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As I once heard about cowboy leadership principles, &amp;quot;If you are leading a herd of cattle, take a look around every once in a while and make sure they are still following you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/2VEx_5YhIFo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Start Lean Journey by Planning the Trip </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I speak with people about lean programs, I am often asked, &amp;ldquo;Where should we start?&amp;rdquo; While this sounds like a very simple question, it actually requires a lot of thought. However, the simple answer is that you must first decide where you want to go before you know where you should start. Think of it like this: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you want to go, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you have a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have a GPS for my car that is pretty high tech. It communicates with satellites that are orbiting thousands of miles above the Earth. It can tell me where I am, give turn-by-turn directions and even tell me how fast I am going. However, with all of that technology, if I can&amp;rsquo;t put in a final destination, the GPS is pretty useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The same is true for lean, Six Sigma or whatever you call your continuous improvement effort. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you are trying to go, even the best lean program won&amp;rsquo;t help very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are mountains of information about lean, Toyota Production System and continuous improvement processes out there. You can read a book a week and probably spend several years digesting just what is written so far. You can hire consultants that can make a process lean down to the tenth of a second, and you can save a lot of money. You can even teach some of your folks about lean in the process. All of these things are good, but they are not exactly what we are after &amp;ndash; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should be able to very clearly and concisely articulate where it is that you want to go before you do any of the things above. If you can&amp;rsquo;t, don&amp;rsquo;t start yet. When I ask this simple question to companies and people who ask me where to start, I usually get answers that may be accurate but aren&amp;rsquo;t really relevant. For example, I might hear, &amp;ldquo;We want to get better,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We want to save money.&amp;rdquo; While those are things that lean can help achieve, neither of them paints the picture of what you want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You can read some of the lean and continuous improvement books out there to get ideas or talk to some lean professionals, but be sure to decide where you are trying to go before you take off on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some of the things you should consider include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Have I gone through a reorganization that could impact the quality of my product?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is changing on the economic landscape that will impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What new changes may come out of the new government administration that may change my business model?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What opportunities are being created right now that we need to capitalize on for the future?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are there &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; issues that may impact my business?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How old is our product offering, and is it time for a review?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is the long-term corporate strategy, and how do we support that strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are many other items that you should discuss as a team when formulating the vision for a continuous improvement program. The point is to have the conversations now before you start. Make sure you can clearly and consistently articulate what is important and what you are working toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The challenge for you and your colleagues is to be able to clearly answer and articulate an answer to the question, &amp;ldquo;Why are we embracing continuous improvement?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/BiagquYOqmA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Use Key Performance-based Metrics </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In today&amp;rsquo;s competitive global environment, we are constantly being asked to do more with less. Now more than ever, companies are asking their employees to become more productive, more efficient and more &amp;ldquo;lean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Strategic planning, value stream mapping, reliability engineering, loss elimination &amp;ndash; these phrases have become popular from the boardroom to the shop floor. But where does their value really lie? How do we make decisions that uncover value, eliminate loss and allow for proper strategic planning for the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answer lies not in the decisions we make but in the data we use to make those decisions. Good, strong data is key to making good, strong decisions. We are all familiar with the axiom of &amp;ldquo;garbage in, garbage out.&amp;rdquo; So what kind of data should we use? What metrics give us the best snapshot of our current levels of performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Asset utilization (AU) and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) are key performance-based metrics that, when calculated and communicated properly, allow for effective facility management and provide sound backing for potentially difficult business decisions to be made. However, much confusion lies in their definition and understanding when and where to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AU is defined as: availability x rate x quality&lt;br /&gt;
	OEE is defined as: uptime x rate x quality&lt;br /&gt;
	As you can see, AU and OEE are similar &amp;ndash; both calculations for rate and quality are the same, and are defined as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/9427c4a5-6466-4d8e-a2bf-7bef27e61365_AU and OEE image 1.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where average rate is the speed or efficiency of the system under analysis over a given time period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best demonstrated or design rate is determined by the nameplate capacity of the system or the best demonstrated rate recorded. I prefer to use the best demonstrated rate, as empirical data is a better model of the system in question. A 100-percent rate calculation would signal that the system is operating consistently at its maximum demonstrated speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/fc289d33-e998-459c-bcc8-01dc1ae596a1_AU and OEE image 2.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where first pass units is defined as the good units produced over a certain time period that meet customer specifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These &amp;ldquo;quality&amp;rdquo; units are compared to the total units produced, including those that do not meet customer specifications. A 100-percent quality calculation would signify no scrap or rework in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on the above formulas, you can easily see that the difference between OEE and AU lies in how you compare availability and uptime. So what is the difference? Availability and uptime are defined as follows:&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/dc027bfb-15b2-4a86-be25-4ee59bf4f14d_AU and OEE image 3.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 151px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;where operating time is defined as the amount of time that the system is actually operating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Calendar time is based on the 24/7/365 schedule as we know it. Scheduled time is defined as the amount of time the system under analysis was planned or scheduled to operate. Therefore, if I operate my system for six hours on one eight-hour shift during a given day, my uptime is 6/8 or 75 percent, while my availability is 6/24 or 25 percent. That is quite a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, OEE is used to understand how well systems or assets perform based on current business demands and production schedules. AU allows for a better understanding of how well that system or asset is currently utilized and allows insight for future business planning by calculating what type of production could be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In some industries (petroleum, specialty chemical, etc.), scheduled time is equal to calendar time. In this case, availability equals uptime, so OEE and AU are equal. This scenario is similar to how a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle isn&amp;rsquo;t a square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to understand the terminology. My background in Six Sigma differentiated between availability and uptime for AU and OEE, respectively. Lean terminology defines OEE as the product of availability x rate x quality, with availability defined in the same way uptime is defined (above). So which is correct? The truth is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. What is important is to clearly define what you and your organization are trying to capture, agree on common terminology to allow for clear and concise discussion, and determine the best way to capture the needed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As always, the devil is in the details. When setting up data-capture systems to determine rate and quality and uptime/availability calculations, take care to ensure consistent measurement and data validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In summary, AU and OEE can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/1/23/fc89fb18-130d-406f-a0c2-695af5b34c6e_AU and OEE image 4.jpeg" style="width: 646px; height: 237px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Purdue to offer lean manufacturing, Six Sigma training</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Purdue University again in 2011 will offer training in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma practices for which professionals can earn certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The courses, sponsored by the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, part of Purdue&amp;#39;s Technical Assistance Program, are for those currently working and for displaced professionals. Those who are unemployed may be eligible for training funds to pay for some of the courses and should check with their local WorkOne office for eligibility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Six Sigma Green Belt and Six Sigma Black Belt courses combine a detailed roadmap with statistical tools to resolve critical business issues. These are recommended for owners or management teams, engineers or technical staff from small to medium-sized companies. Participants should have some knowledge of basic statistics.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Green Belts typically work in teams to implement improvements. Black Belts independently apply more sophisticated tools to guide improvements throughout a business or organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Advanced Manufacturing (Lean) Practitioner training focuses on waste removal from production or office processes. It covers principles of lean manufacturing, the 5-S visual workplace, principles of stream mapping, quick changeover/setup reduction and total productive maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Training will be held in Evansville, Fort Wayne and Indianapolis. Course specifics and registration information are available at mep.purdue.edu/events. Displaced professionals seeking to apply for training funds should print course brochures from the website and take them to WorkOne for review.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center provides technical skills development and implementation services to manufacturers who want to increase productivity and profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, and advance work-force skills. Areas of expertise include advanced manufacturing processes, lean implementation, quality management systems, Six Sigma, green enterprise development and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/1D56LiE31gA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing plant has been named one of the 10 best plants in North America by &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=IndustryWeek+in+the+magazine%27s+annual+competition.&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=dc40e623c18abcf0772e5d1095810046" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek &lt;/i&gt;in the magazine&amp;rsquo;s annual competition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, a panel of the magazine&amp;rsquo;s editors and outside experts recognize North American facilities that are on the leading edge of efforts to increase competitiveness, enhance customer satisfaction and create stimulating and rewarding work environments. This year, Avery Dennison&amp;rsquo;s plant, which manufactures Avery brand office products, stood out from other entries with consistently high quality, rigorous maintenance and safety results, and especially its use of Enterprise Lean Sigma (ELS) to create efficiencies, improve productivity and increase customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Tijuana is a model of a continuously learning organization,&amp;quot; said Greg Temple, Avery Dennison vice president, global operations and Enterprise Lean Sigma. &amp;quot;They have overcome significant business challenges over the years through a relentless focus on waste and process discipline, and &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#39;s recognition is very gratifying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among its accomplishments, the Office Products plant has operated with 98 percent &amp;ldquo;first-pass&amp;rdquo; yield of products; achieved nearly $6 million in documented improvement projects in 2009; and gained a total of 310,000 square feet over the last five years through ELS initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The review panel also noted that one of the plant&amp;rsquo;s outstanding characteristics is the depth of employee engagement. &lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; noted the high number of employee suggestions and cited the example of production worker Azucena Robles, who proposed using a compressed air gun at a strategic point on the assembly line for Avery Glue Stics to keep the line moving while label applicators are refilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Everyone in the Tijuana plant, from the plant leadership team to the operators on the shop floor, is using creative problem-solving skills,&amp;rdquo; said Tim Bond, group vice president, Avery Dennison Office Products. &amp;ldquo;One of their products is continuous improvement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;i&gt;IndustryWeek&lt;/i&gt; will honor the Tijuana team during a ceremony this April in Atlanta, Ga., and will feature the facility in its January issue, which is available &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Findustryweek.com%2Farticles%2F2010_iw_best_plants_winners_excellence_thrives_23430.aspx%3FShowAll%3D1&amp;amp;esheet=6549283&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=online+now&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=1eb77d1f417484f7b770f4180ca9d9a0" target="_blank"&gt;online now&lt;/a&gt;. The competition is in its 21st year and previous recent winners include Raytheon, Philips and Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Avery Dennison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A very good primer on Six Sigma principles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What is Six Sigma? It&amp;#39;s a systematic way to solve problems involving defects and deviation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You only need a handful of tools to solve most problems:&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Control charts of current performance (and to monitor performance after improvement.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Pareto charts (for defects) and histograms (for variation)&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Ishikawa - Fishbone diagrams for root cause analysis&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Address waste, rework, defects with 4-50 Rule</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Learn the 4-50 Rule:&amp;nbsp;Four percent&amp;nbsp;of the steps in any process cause 50% of the waste, rework, defects, deviation and lost profit. Use Pareto charts to narrow your focus to the 4% to maximize results and profit.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lean and Six Sigma talent management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Each year, the executive recruiting and search firm The Avery Point Group conducts a comprehensive study of the latest talent demand trends for lean&amp;nbsp;and Six Sigma. As an executive search firm, Avery Point has a unique vantage point from which to track trends taking place in industry. Trends in industry are often telegraphed into candidate requirements in job postings and can serve as a window into the latest corporate initiatives. For its annual study, the firm takes a significant look at Six Sigma and lean job postings found on the major job boards and review each job title and job content profile to gain a deeper understanding of the latest talent demand trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the years of conducting the study, Avery Point has&amp;nbsp;seen a significant shift in the &amp;quot;center of gravity&amp;quot; as it relates to the prominence of Lean as the rising and now more dominate player in the corporate world of continuous improvement. This is a significant shift from the first study in 2005, where Six Sigma outpaced lean by more than 50 percent&amp;nbsp;as the more desired skill set. Avery Point fully expects this trend to continue in our future studies as more companies turn to lean as a hedge against growing economic and inflationary challenges.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the end, however, the real winner is any company that successfully engages in some form of continuous improvement, regardless of whether it is lean, Six Sigma, or some other well-executed approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t think of any company that claims to be world class that is not utilizing some form of continuous improvement approach,&amp;quot; says Tim Noble, managing principal of The Avery Point Group. &amp;quot;World-class status is a constantly moving target defined by both your customers and your competitors. Without a continuous improvement approach you&amp;#39;re not even treading water in today&amp;#39;s highly competitive global economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Jack Welch discusses innovation in keynote speech</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, discusses innovation at symposium at Boston University&amp;#39;s School of Management. Welch says that although people often think innovation is limited to practical scientific advances, it&amp;#39;s much more than that. It&amp;#39;s about expansion. When you see something someone else has done, Welch says, you have to take it and bring it to new levels. To innovate something is as important as inventing it.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>ASQ recognizes individuals with most certifications</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The American Society for Quality (ASQ), the world&amp;rsquo;s largest network of quality resources and experts, is proud to recognize the quality professionals who currently hold the most ASQ certifications. In total there are 11 individuals who currently hold 14 out of 18 ASQ certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Muralidhar Audipudy, Round Lake, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mahlon Cashman, Westfield, Mass.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sheldon Dummer, Grayslake, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Peter Ganavazos, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rajinder Kapur, Troy, Mich.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		John Lee, Sandy, Utah&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Yeo Leong, Singapore&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		William Meyer, O&amp;rsquo;Fallon, Mo.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Francois Pageau, Le Gardeur, Quebec, Canada&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kevin Quigg, Carol Stream, Ill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Michael Young, Neosho, Mo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1968, when the first ASQ certification exam was given, more than 170,000 individuals have taken the path to reaching their goal of becoming ASQ-certified in their field or profession. To learn more about ASQ&amp;rsquo;s certifications, visit &lt;a href="http://asq.org/certification/index.html"&gt;http://www.asq.org/certification/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	William Meyer, a quality specialist at The Boeing Company, is one ASQ member who has seen a distinct advantage to obtaining ASQ certifications. He is an ASQ Certified Biomedical Auditor, Calibration Technician, Six Sigma Green Belt, Quality Inspector, Quality Auditor, Quality Engineer, Quality Improvement Associate, Quality Process Analyst, Quality Technician, Reliability Engineer, Software Quality Engineer, Six Sigma Black Belt, HACCP Auditor, and Manager of Quality/Organizational Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Working to attain my ASQ certifications has put me on a path of success,&amp;quot; says Meyer. &amp;quot;Not only did I receive peer recognition, but recognition from my employer. My knowledge base has expanded and I feel more confident than ever of my skills in today&amp;rsquo;s employment landscape.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;ASQ provides certification as a way to provide formal recognition to professionals who have demonstrated an understanding of, and a commitment to, quality techniques and practices in their job and career,&amp;quot; explains Paul Borawski, ASQ executive director and chief strategic officer. &amp;quot;This is a great accomplishment and represents a high level of peer recognition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salary Survey Shows Certification Advantage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2009 &lt;a href="http://asq.org/media-room/press-releases/2009/20091201-salary-survey.html"&gt;Salary Survey&lt;/a&gt; shows 57.8 percent of respondents stating that they have at least one ASQ certification. While certifications and training allow quality professionals to gain new skills and proficiencies, evidence shows that these items can also greatly increase a quality professional&amp;rsquo;s earning potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Managers who are ASQ Certified Managers of Quality/Organizational Excellence reported they earn a higher average salary than their counterparts without this certification. In the United States, the difference is $9,551. In Canada, the difference is $7,742.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The top ASQ certifications held are ASQ Certified Quality Auditor (CQA) and ASQ Certified Quality Engineer (CQE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Respondents who completed one or more Six Sigma training programs report average earnings of $12,456 more than those who didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About ASQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	ASQ is a global community of people dedicated to quality who share the ideas and tools that make our world work better.

            <title>Nordson names vice president of global continuous improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nordson Corporation on October 28 announced the appointment of James E. DeVries to the newly created enterprise-level position of vice president of global continuous improvement. Reporting directly to Nordson president and CEO Michael F. Hilton, DeVries will be tasked with driving profitable growth in all operating segments through elevation of Nordson&amp;rsquo;s ongoing continuous improvement and margin enhancement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are committed to building on excellence and extending our competitive advantages everywhere we operate,&amp;rdquo; said Hilton. &amp;ldquo;While Nordson&amp;rsquo;s current performance is at a very strong level, we believe there are multiple opportunities for us to deliver even better performance. The creation of this new position provides the additional organizational focus necessary to capitalize on these opportunities. Jim DeVries is an ideal choice for this new challenge and among Nordson&amp;rsquo;s most proven senior leaders. As vice president of operations for Nordson&amp;rsquo;s largest operating segment, Adhesive Dispensing Systems, Jim has demonstrated the ability to drive improved performance across multiple geographies and end markets over a sustained period. His ongoing efforts in his new position will take Nordson beyond Lean to the next level of performance, enable us to serve our customers more effectively and ultimately deliver greater benefits to our shareholders over the long term.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeVries will build and lead a global team tasked with setting productivity goals, defining key metrics, ensuring overall process consistency across the company, and leading large enterprise step-change projects. He will lead the reporting and development of business decision information and tools in partnership with Nordson&amp;rsquo;s finance team. Additional responsibilities include development and training for continuous improvement tools including Lean and Six Sigma. He also will drive other margin enhancing processes including customer and product segmentation with profitability analysis, pricing management and strategy, and broad based internal and external benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DeVries has held a variety of operational and engineering positions with increasing responsibilities during his 25 year career at Nordson. Most recently he served as Adhesive Dispensing Systems vice president, North America and China Engineering &amp;amp; Operations. During his time in that role, two facilities within the segment were selected as winners in IndustryWeek magazine&amp;rsquo;s prestigious Best Plants competition. Nordson&amp;rsquo;s plants were recognized for excellence in operational improvements, agile production systems, supplier partnerships, customer focus, employee empowerment, quality systems, management practices, proactive environmental and safety practices, and manufacturing capability. DeVries has also served as Vice President of Adhesives Dispensing Systems&amp;rsquo; non-wovens product line and as a systems engineering manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nordson Corporation is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading producers of precision dispensing equipment that applies adhesives, sealants, liquid and powder coatings and other materials to a broad range of consumer and industrial products during manufacturing operations. The company also manufactures equipment used in the testing and inspection of electronic components as well as technology-based systems for UV curing and surface treatment processes.

            <title>The five key elements of Total Productive Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Marshall Institute president Greg Folts discusses the&amp;nbsp;five key elements of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). All&amp;nbsp;five elements must be in place for an organization to achieve the full potential of TPM and maintenance excellence.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Maintenance&amp;#39;s role in organizational performance is finally being realized. The efficiency of a facilities operation is largely dependant on the effectiveness of its maintenance program. TPM is a proven initiative - driven by both maintenance and operations - that can significantly increase equipment reliability and uptime while reducing unnecessary costs. The end result is a large impact of the company&amp;#39;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ASQ Lean and Six Sigma Conference focuses on customer satisfaction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Organizations know the key to survival is maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, because keeping customers is much easier than earning new ones. Those organizations also know that using lean and Six Sigma helps them to stay fiscally competitive. But now the task is combining financial stability and increased customer satisfaction. The quality community will have an opportunity to learn just that at ASQ&amp;rsquo;s 2011 &lt;a href="http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lean and Six Sigma Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2011 Lean and Six Sigma Conference will be held February 28 to March 1 in Phoenix, Ariz., at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. Session topics include: Six Sigma for Crisis Management; Attack and Relieve Your Healthcare Pain; White Collar Lean: Kaizen Events for the Office; How to Provide Value More Quickly to Your Customers; Gauging Readiness for Lean; and Growing Six Sigma Without Sacrificing Requirements. The full program and session descriptions can be found at &lt;a href="http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://asq.org/conferences/six-sigma/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She then worked for Textron Fluid and Power, where she was based in South Africa, and was responsible for continuous improvement activities at facilities located in Australia, Switzerland, France, and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Finalists unveiled for iSixSigmaâs Best Places to Work</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	iSixSigma.com and &lt;em&gt;iSixSigma Magazine&lt;/em&gt; have announced that the top 10 finalist companies have been chosen for the third annual list of iSixSigma&amp;rsquo;s Best Places to Work for Six Sigma professionals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over the past several years, many organizations have re-evaluated how they approach their process improvement programs,&amp;rdquo; said Jessica Harper, editor-in-chief of iSixSigma. &amp;ldquo;But the participation and results of iSixSigma&amp;rsquo;s Best Places to Work confirm that Six Sigma is still a key component of that approach. Participating companies have invested in establishing an environment that attracts and supports Six Sigma professionals, helping to strengthen their organizations as whole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Here is the list of finalists for iSixSigma&amp;rsquo;s Best Places to Work, in alphabetical order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		American Eurocopter Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cardinal Health Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Computacenter AG &amp;amp; Company oHG&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Ecolab Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		McKesson Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Merck &amp;amp; Company Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pfizer Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Starwood Hotels &amp;amp; Resorts &amp;ndash; North America&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		TELUS Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		UnitedHealthcare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	iSixSigma.com and &lt;em&gt;iSixSigma Magazine&lt;/em&gt; sponsored the list, which received nearly 40 nominations from around the world. Nineteen companies met all the entry requirements and completed a two-part online survey. The senior Six Sigma leader submitted answers to an employer survey, and the full-time Six Sigma personnel at each company submitted answers to an employee survey.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Response from employees of the participating companies was impressive, with more than 1,100 Six Sigma professionals submitting surveys. The 10 companies listed should be proud of their efforts to foster such a supportive environment that allows the culture of continuous improvement to thrive,&amp;rdquo; said Randy Woods, associate editor of iSixSigma.com and &lt;em&gt;iSixSigma Magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To determine the finalist companies, iSixSigma took into consideration general deployment characteristics, as well as specific employee input, totaling the scores from the two surveys. The greatest weight was given to the employee survey, which asked questions in five main categories: job satisfaction, culture, compensation/rewards and recognition, training and career development and Net Promoter Score. Of these categories, the most weight was given to job satisfaction, as that is what employees had said was the most important factor to them when it comes to a working environment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Those on the Top 10 list will be recognized at the &lt;a href="http://live.isixsigma.com/miami2011"&gt;iSixSigma Live! Summit &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;, February 7-10, 2011, at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa in Miami. The No. 1&amp;nbsp;Best Place to Work will be announced at the awards ceremony, as will the rankings of the rest on the list of finalists. The finalists will also be honored in the March/April 2011 issue of &lt;em&gt;iSixSigma Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and on iSixSigma.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/FPmjNSa0QsI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>TPM and operator asset ownership: This is my equipment!</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) combines the traditionally American practice of preventive maintenance with total quality control and total employee involvement to create a culture where operators develop ownership of their equipment, and become full partners with maintenance, engineering and management to assure that equipment operates properly every day. As part of modern TPM applications, the asset owner/operator performs much, and sometimes all, of the routine autonomous maintenance (AM) tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Autonomous maintenance ideally ensures appropriate and effective efforts are expended since the machine is wholly the domain of one person or team. TPM is a critical adjunct to lean manufacturing. If machine uptime is not predictable and if process capabilities are not sustained, the processes become unstable and production flows will be interrupted. One way to think of TPM is &amp;ldquo;asset deterioration prevention&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;maintenance prevention&amp;rdquo;, not fixing/repairing machines in a constant reactive environment. For this reason, TPM is also referred to as &amp;ldquo;Total Productive Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Total Process Management&amp;rdquo;. TPM is a proactive approach that essentially aims to prevent any kind of losses before occurrence. Its motto is &amp;ldquo;zero error, zero work-related accident and zero loss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reacting to breakdowns and dealing with production losses is unfortunately still a daily routine for most asset-intensive manufacturing organizations. Competition continues to raise the bar, thus increasing pressure on the &amp;ldquo;cost of goods sold&amp;rdquo; (COGS) and the opportunity costs of lost production. With the globalization of manufacturing of most products, organizations must compete with low-cost producers and are forced to take action.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What action to take? If it were as easy as hiring a smart leader for manufacturing, every plant would have the shiny wall plaque that illustrates their brilliance for excellent performance. Operational Excellence (OpEx) is based on a holistic asset design, asset care and asset management concept powered by Reliability Excellence (Rx). It requires total collaborative, fully integrated effort by all functional departments at a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Driving an organization toward OpEx is a realistic goal when there is solid Rx program and project management coupled with proven TPM strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From experience, Life Cycle Engineering knows that if the fundamentals of asset reliability are not in place, it is difficult to sustain TPM. Even with significant activities and training, sustainability is a challenge. LCE assures that all Rx elements are in place to support the TPM culture to grow in a responsible manner with the target of achieving Operational Excellence. The goal of this article is to show that a basic asset-centric care program can be an effective foundation for a fully functioning preventive and predictive maintenance and operator care program. Operator care correctly applied can make a profound contribution to any organization implementing a Six Sigma, continuous improvement or similar quality strategy. Most importantly, basic operator care can have a significant positive effect on asset availability coupled with reductions in operations and maintenance expenditures through the achievement of increased asset reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we will concentrate on some conceptual issues to operator care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What is operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Origins of operator care&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care and Six Sigma, CI, other improvement methods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operator care as part of the overall asset reliability strategy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Benefits of TPM/AM operator care programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;What is Operator Care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care is a commitment by plant management, operations and maintenance to ensure that assets maintain their expected level of quality and volume for output, while reaching their expected life span within the plant. Operator care attempts to greatly reduce or eliminate reactive maintenance and is driven by operations/production. In operator care environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plant condition is optimum (TPM and 5-S are applied)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Operators are engaged in asset care
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Tighten, lubricate, clean, (detect, inspect, correct)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Can be autonomous maintenance (AM) (operator-performed maintenance)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Standard operating procedures are in use&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reliability and operability is included in the design&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment standardization is evident&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Skills (hard and soft) training is continuous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Loss elimination is ongoing; overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is being measured&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Small cross-functional teams are solving problems (failure modes and effects analyses, five-why&amp;rsquo;s, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;TPM is Operator Driven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The operators&amp;rsquo; creed of TPM is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it clean&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep it lubricated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Monitor for degradation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain it before production is affected&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Simplify and improve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d759dc67-600c-4ea8-b594-8313224c954f_scheller01.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 96px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These elements are all carried out in a thorough asset care regimen. The investigative part of this regimen also attempts to catch incipient problems by monitoring assets for both visual (qualitative) and measurable (quantitative) indications of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with the inspection processes of the program, an operator care process focuses on continued education of operators (all shifts), maintenance and reliability staff. Operator care puts high emphasis on both operator-managed inspection programs and lubrication management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Origins of TPM/AM and Operator Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the 1950s, the Japanese industry, faced with considerable challenges, developed a variant of planned maintenance now known as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). As with planned maintenance, frequent inspections are a fundamental tenet of the TPM process, with a heavy emphasis on involving equipment operators in the inspection process. Operator care is derived from several of the concepts (&amp;ldquo;pillars&amp;rdquo;) of TPM. Some of these concepts are found in the sample slides shared below. They are from a TPM conference in India and are courtesy of Shiram Pistons &amp;amp; Rings Ltd., an automotive manufacturer in that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/3c2d7048-7c27-4aa8-b229-7f219a4b49a2_scheller02.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 364px;" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4. Fusion of Corporate Management &amp;amp; TPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/27/quick/d5d7e1b0-5646-4412-8bda-7163a1bf9e9e_scheller03.jpeg" style="width: 550px; height: 355px;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7. People Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care and Six Sigma, CI, Other Asset Improvement Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	A Six Sigma (DMAIC) systemic quality program provides businesses with the tools to improve the capability of their business processes. Six Sigma can be defined as a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects in a wide variety of processes, which includes all forms of manufacturing and process industries. A key element of Six Sigma programs is &amp;ldquo;kaizen&amp;rdquo;, the Japanese process of continuous improvement using a variety of problem-solving and analysis techniques. One of the fundamentals of the Six Sigma approach is the requirement for data. Data sets are used to determine the original state of a process, the current state of that process, the rate of improvement and the proximity of the process to the desired quality levels. Operator care, with its emphasis on frequent and rigorously scheduled inspections, produces a steady stream of both quantified and qualified evaluations of assets, systems and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The data collected by these inspections, plus the data generated to measure the compliance to the operator care inspection schedule itself, can be used effectively to generate metrics for any Six Sigma program. A well-run basic asset care program is not only a catalyst for improvement in and of itself; it can also be one of the primary data gathering tools to evaluate the effectiveness of all continuous improvement procedures within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Operator Care is Part of Overall Asset Management and Reliability Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care fits in as a foundational element of a site&amp;rsquo;s total plant operational and Reliability Excellence strategy. The strategy details the availability and contribution of a plant&amp;rsquo;s resources to be used in asset inspection, condition monitoring, planning and scheduling, and logistics for the creation of a reliability program. The strategy provides for optimal use of organizational resources with sufficient asset availability to meet the organization&amp;rsquo;s output requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A modern plant asset management effort uses the skill sets available within the organization (and through the judicious use of external expertise) to generate improvements in all elements of LCE&amp;rsquo;s Reliability Excellence model (see &lt;a href="http://www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html"&gt;www.lce.com/Reliability_Excellence_Model_15.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results of implementing all integrated elements holistically can consequently lead to substantial performance improvements, value creation and securing a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of TPM/AM Operator Care Programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Operator care programs have been implemented in hundreds of organizations &amp;ndash; both in process and discrete manufacturing facilities. Benefits of a successfully implemented asset care and reliability improvement program include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improvement in OEE&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Manufacturing Cost Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Labor Utilization&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Production Lead Time Trend&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Positive Impact on EHS performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Wind power company gets to the root of icy issue</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With a steady breeze, a wind turbine &amp;ndash; stretching 262 feet high &amp;ndash; majestically turns its three powerful blades, generating enough clean, renewable electricity to power 750 homes for a 24-hour period. When the breeze turns into a driving wind combined with ice, freezing rain, snow and even freezing fog, the turbine&amp;rsquo;s anemometer, which measures wind speed and force, can freeze up and result in costly downtime for wind power companies such as Clipper Windpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;About Clipper Windpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Headquartered in Carpinteria, Calif., Clipper Windpower is a rapidly growing company engaged in wind energy technology, wind turbine manufacturing and wind project development. Clipper employs more than 850 people in the United States, Denmark and the United Kingdom. At the heart of its manufacturing operations is an ISO 9001-certified manufacturing and assembly facility that began operations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in March 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/13cbbcb8-e4bb-446a-b5f0-ca9452efc844_Jacobsen01.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 269px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Turning to Quality to Improve Turbine Availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As Clipper&amp;rsquo;s first wind turbines came online in northwest Iowa, western Illinois and western New York near Buffalo, the winter of 2007-2008 hit hard and fast, with freezing rain and fog causing anemometer units to fail. While the towers continued to run, without the anemometers, there was no guidance on which direction to move the 153-foot blades to harness the wind most effectively. Clipper initially tried to address the problem through software upgrades, but soon additional anemometers began to freeze, compounding the problem and impacting turbine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without a quick solution available and with growing numbers of anemometers impacted each day, Clipper initiated a root cause analysis (RCA), an integral part of the Six Sigma define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) problem-solving process. The rigorous DMAIC approach defines the steps a team follows, starting with identifying the problem and ending with implementing a long-lasting solution. To evaluate potential RCA projects, Mike Trueg, manager of field quality assurance/continuous improvement at Clipper&amp;rsquo;s Cedar Rapids plant, uses a matrix that measures the impact of safety, quality and turbine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;For this project, the scoring met the criteria because of the big impact on turbine availability,&amp;rdquo; said Trueg, an ASQ senior member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An RCA project was chartered to address the weather-related anemometer issues. The project objective was to identify the root cause of the anemometer failures that was leading to downtime and decreasing turbine availability. A project team was tasked with creating an action plan and implementing corrective actions by the start of the next winter season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Following the DMAIC Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Selecting team members for this RCA project was somewhat challenging, recalls Ellen Sennett, who served as the project&amp;rsquo;s co-leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We started with people who had experience with electrical issues since that seemed to be the problem,&amp;rdquo; said Sennett, an employee of Clipper for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In all, seven stakeholder areas were represented on the improvement team, as shown in the table in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/cb3dd9db-453a-4982-9104-83e0213d6319_Jacobsen02.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 115px" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not all team members participated during every stage of the project; for example, the vendor representatives came onboard once the root cause was identified. The team worked through the steps as outlined in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/9/20/quick/584b0465-d7fe-493f-a823-ddb9f34144c1_Jacobsen03.jpeg" style="width: 500px; height: 198px" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Defining the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Soon after the initial weather-related failures, the company began collecting data each time inclement weather took a turbine offline. This early data collection led to the charter of the RCA project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Measuring to Quantify the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The data collected indicated that, although the winter weather conditions were severe, both precipitation and temperatures fell within the supplier&amp;rsquo;s specifications for the anemometer. The RCA team developed a supplier-inputs-process-outputs-customer (SIPOC) matrix to quantify the problem and any perceived aspects of the root cause. To pinpoint possible root causes of equipment failures, they also completed a fishbone diagram, which generated 45 items for further study. Next, RCA team members entered the potential causes into a cause and effects matrix to focus on the most likely culprits. The matrix tool enabled the team to pare down the potential causes to nine items for a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing Data to Determine the Root Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next step for Sennett and her team was to develop a data collection plan covering the potential causes with the highest risk priority numbers from the FMEA. In all, data were collected from tests performed on 13 FMEA potential causes &amp;ndash; ranging from improper training on work instructions for wiring the heating circuits to issues with heating the transducer cap on the anemometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After data collection and testing of the anemometer, the RCA team concluded that the supplier&amp;rsquo;s design of the heating circuit did not meet the advertised specification. This failure led to an insufficient heating circuit for Clipper&amp;rsquo;s application and, thus, caused weather-related failures of the company&amp;rsquo;s wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett remembers that getting the supplier of the anemometers to acknowledge that its product did not work in the field as promised was a real challenge. Eventually, data from the field and the RCA project convinced the supplier. In hindsight, Sennett feels that perhaps her team could have involved the supplier in the project a little sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It would have been beneficial to have the supplier go through the DMAIC steps with us and discover the root cause, instead of us finding it and telling them they had a problem,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Identifying and Implementing a Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With the root cause in hand, the team began to evaluate improvements to the anemometer&amp;rsquo;s heating circuits through a series of winter weather-simulated validation tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trueg reports that, having 405 units to replace, data analysis was vital: &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why we created our own winter weather environment with a wind machine and a misting device to verify our solution. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to remediate all these sites and then have to do it again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following military standard 810F section 521.2 for icing/freezing rain, the Clipper team directed three rounds of laboratory testing to analyze the performance of three prototypes for an improved anemometer. The first new prototype was immediately rejected because the simulated winter conditions created an ice buildup, which quickly caused the anemometer to fail. A second prototype also failed before a third version finally withstood the extreme weather conditions of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the testing was completed, the team created an action plan. The plan goal was to have all anemometers on each of the 405 turbines throughout the country replaced with the newly designed version by March 30, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Controlling to Confirm Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to the heating circuit improvements based on the lab testing, several other controls were introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The vendor conducts 100 percent inspection of the product through a three-day burn test of the unit&amp;rsquo;s heating system. This eliminates the shipment of any defective products.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All anemometers are tested with a turbine control unit in the manufacturing facility to validate functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The new anemometer design also incorporates a connector that can only attach one way to the junction box, thus eliminating improper wiring in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The wiring is color-coded for the operators who install the connectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;New Design Stands Up to Mother Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While field testing began late in the winter of 2008-2009, Clipper realized the importance of carrying over the testing into the winter of 2009-2010 to confirm the effectiveness of its improvement plan. Once again, Mother Nature cooperated by throwing her full bag of winter tricks, as 40 to 50 mph winds, one-half-inch of ice, 4 to 8 inches of snow, and temperatures of minus-15 degrees and below were reported at various wind farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite these conditions, Clipper recorded only two weather-related anemometer issues, for a 1.6-percent failure rate. Clipper soon discovered that the two failures were caused by a supplier assembly team issue and were not directly related to the improvements generated by the RCA project. With the improvements and control verified, the RCA project was officially closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The RCA team kept turbine customers informed throughout the DMAIC process with presentations about remediation steps to reduce the weather-related failures. Team members walked through the entire DMAIC process with key customers and explained how the root cause was determined, as well as plans to implement corrective action. Sennett added that many of Clipper&amp;rsquo;s customers are familiar with Six Sigma tools, so the RCA process is the type of problem solving they like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This process helps with customer satisfaction as (customers) know we are taking the time to find the root cause and using trained people to do [corrective action] the right way the first time,&amp;rdquo; Sennett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	External customers weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones who benefited from this RCA project. Employees at Clipper&amp;rsquo;s remote monitoring dispatch center, which controls the turbines from the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, facility, saw a decreased workload as fewer turbines required attention during inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett believes that this RCA project and others that followed help Clipper&amp;rsquo;s employees think more proactively and address issues before they become fleet-wide issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our goal is to become more preventive and look at things before they start to fail, and with the Six Sigma processes you can do a better job of designing out the defects in the beginning before implementation,&amp;rdquo; noted Sennett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Building a Culture of Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Trueg and Sennett credit this RCA project for opening their eyes to key issues such as internal testing and expanding the company&amp;rsquo;s supplier base. As a result of this improvement project, Clipper created a plan for introducing new suppliers to avoid potential problems caused by single sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve also developed testing here at the manufacturing site, so if we have quality issues, we can test before sending something out into the field that potentially causes failures or creates the need for a replacement part,&amp;rdquo; said Trueg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sennett said that while some team members were initially skeptical about the DMAIC process, they quickly learned the importance of taking the time for each step, recognizing that without the structured process, people tend to collect unnecessary data unrelated to the issue. For several team members, working on this project sparked an interest in learning more about process improvement and prompted them to request further training and the opportunity to earn Six Sigma green belt certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Trueg is amazed at the change in Clipper&amp;rsquo;s staff once they serve on an RCA team: &amp;ldquo;The attitudes and focus on problem solving with data are a strong part of the Clipper culture.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;For more information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sennett and Trueg recommend the following books to guide your process improvement activities: The Lean Six Sigma Pocket Toolbook by Michael L. George, David Rowlands, Mark Price and John Maxey, and Statistics for the Utterly Confused by Lloyd Jaisingh.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>A plain English guide to modern manufacturing methods</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Methods of manufacturing have changed a great deal since the Ford assembly line, shifting from the rigid, push-oriented production principles of the early 20th century to more flexible, pull principles. If you find yourself wondering what a pull principle is, you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Put simply, assembly line manufacturers historically pushed mass production ahead based on estimates of future demand, which often resulted in wasted effort and resources when customers failed to produce the estimated demand. Modern companies can&amp;rsquo;t afford this kind of waste, so they wait for actual demand to pull production forward, manufacturing products when they&amp;rsquo;ve been requested by customers or when the previous batch of products has sold out.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Consider this analogy: By trying to guess potential demand, manufacturers often found themselves in the same situation as someone carrying an umbrella on a sunny day because the forecast predicted rain; it was extra effort for no reason. Modern manufacturers prefer to stick their head out the window and check for rain before grabbing their umbrella, so to speak, limiting waste and maximizing efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unfortunately, understanding the many complex strategies behind these new manufacturing methods can be as difficult as predicting the weather, as they have brought along with them a series of three-letter acronyms that dominate jargon-filled conversations about current manufacturing trends, like JIT, TPM, QRM and JIS. These letters don&amp;rsquo;t exactly help to explain the basic ideas behind pull-production manufacturing, which actually make a lot of sense when spoken in plain English. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to break down the key concepts of lean manufacturing, Six Sigma and flexible manufacturing. While I couldn&amp;rsquo;t cover every concept &amp;ndash; a Google search for &amp;ldquo;lean manufacturing glossary&amp;rdquo; should satisfy most pedants &amp;ndash; I have reviewed the important terms. Leave a comment below if there are others you&amp;rsquo;d like us to explain. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Basically, modern manufacturing methods boil down to three key concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Reduce waste&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; reduce the amount of materials, capacity and manpower wasted in the process by producing just enough product to meet current demand&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Maintain quality &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash; devise more effective manufacturing methods in order to continue making quality products despite strict reductions of waste&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;strong&gt;Accelerate production&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; decrease the amount of time needed to manufacture product, making up for the lack of surplus&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If this first concept sounds like the motto of the recycling movement, it&amp;rsquo;s because manufacturing, like so many other industries these days, is basing its methods on efforts to avoid waste. Earlier manufacturing methods allowed for waste and an excessive consumption of supplies in order to meet their goals of mass production, but the rebranding of modern manufacturing goes by a new name: lean manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean manufacturing describes the method used to achieve all three of the aforementioned concepts; in theory, a lean manufacturer would have the right supplies arrive at the right place at the right time in the right amount to create only the products that are necessary to meet demand. A number of concepts, defined in the table below, are influential in meeting this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/jannise01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In order to manufacture a product of consistently high quality, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary for manufacturers to not only perform frequent maintenance on their equipment, but on their entire process as well. This means identifying errors or defects in the production flow and eliminating them to maximize productivity. This is where Six Sigma comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The origin of the term itself is very complex. A manufacturing process is given a sigma rating based on the percentage of its product yield determined to be defect-free. A One Sigma rating designates a process with a disastrously low percentage of defect-free yield, 31 percent, while a Six Sigma rating is reserved for processes that are nearly perfect, 99.99966 percent defect-free. In other words, every company wants to achieve Six Sigmas for all of its manufacturing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To meet this goal, the Six Sigma method was created, which focuses on measuring and analyzing process data in order to find and remove defects. Whereas lean manufacturing is concerned with improving the flow between processes to reduce waste, manufacturers use Six Sigma to improve the processes themselves. The table below includes some of the concepts that make Six Sigma work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/jannise02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Accelerate Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the era of lean manufacturing, when surplus product is considered waste, the manufacturing process must work faster to make sure products are made available and demand is met. However, speeding up the process has become more difficult than ever due to an increased customer desire for customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the 20th century, mass production and mass consumption went hand in hand. Assembly lines made it possible to make hundreds of thousands of the same product, and customers were entirely willing to own the exact same thing as their friends and neighbors. Now, with the advent of Internet shopping and its capacity to provide shoppers with a variety of choices, manufacturers must be prepared to adapt and change not only its products but its entire process as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enter flexible manufacturing. Though manufacturers would undoubtedly prefer to continue producing standardized products at low costs, they must nevertheless make the best of their customers&amp;rsquo; new tendencies toward individualized, unique products. These manufacturers can limit their cost increases by designing processes that adjust quickly and effectively to change. This table provides a few of the concepts that allow manufacturers to remain flexible while continuing to reduce waste and maintain quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/jannise03.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With customer demands shifting constantly on a global scale, manufacturers must utilize a number of strategies to maximize their profits and continue to compete. As this guide suggests, the three major goals of reducing cost, maintaining quality and accelerating production are achieved through the combined efforts of lean manufacturing theories, Six Sigma methodologies and flexible processes. It&amp;rsquo;s not a question of which manufacturing method is the right one, it&amp;rsquo;s a question of how to implement them all for optimum results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Six Sigma helps Crown Equipment save nearly $1.5 million</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With a corporate commitment to helping customers lower costs and maximize productivity, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that Crown Equipment Corporation is itself dedicated to lean manufacturing and Total Quality Management. Continuous improvement has been intrinsic to the company&amp;rsquo;s philosophy since its founding in 1945, as management has periodically adjusted product offerings and services to meet changing customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yet even with decades of success that has made the Ohio-based manufacturer the world&amp;rsquo;s top-selling producer of electric lift trucks, the company still recently found ways to use Six Sigma strategies to improve processes, reduce scrap and gas usage, and fine-tune operations. The company now has 18 certified Six Sigma green belts and 15 black belts in its North American manufacturing facilities striving to lead the corporation toward even further improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The little company that could&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Crown Equipment Corporation began as a one-product, one-room operation in the small, rural community of New Bremen, Ohio. Started just after World War II by the late Carl H. Dicke and Allen A. Dicke, the company manufactured temperature controls for coal-burning furnaces. By 1949, the enterprising brothers followed changing technology trends and switched to producing antenna rotators &amp;ndash; devices used to enhance television reception. Even after diversifying into electronic components manufacturing in 1951 and then adding lift trucks in 1957, Crown Equipment continued as a leading manufacturer of antenna rotators until late 2001, by which time changing technologies had rendered them virtually obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still privately owned and managed by descendents of the original founders, Crown&amp;rsquo;s full product line includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Manual propelled pallet trucks and stackers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Power pallet trucks and stackers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sit-down and stand-up counterbalanced trucks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Narrow-aisle reach trucks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Very narrow-aisle turret trucks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Order-picking equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s electric lift trucks are used throughout the world for transporting materials and goods in warehouses, distribution centers and manufacturing environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still headquartered in the same, though renovated and expanded, offices in New Bremen, Crown is now a multinational corporation with regional headquarters in Munich, Germany, and Sydney, Australia. The company has 11 manufacturing facilities in seven U.S. locations and also has strong international manufacturing capabilities, building lift trucks in Sydney, Australia; Roding, Germany; Queretaro, Mexico (two plants); and Suzhou, China. Crown also owns branch sales and service center operations in Australia, Belgium, England, Germany, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and more than 40 locations in the United States. In addition to the company-owned branches, a network of independent U.S. and international Crown dealers operates in nearly 100 cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Despite this diversification and global spread, Crown designs and manufactures 85 percent of its lift truck components. The company also assembles its own products and provides maintenance services to customers. Such vertical integration creates a strong competitive advantage, according to Mark DeGrandchamp, Crown&amp;rsquo;s director of quality and Lean Six Sigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We know our products better,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;because we design and build our own motors, cylinders, electronic assemblies, wire harnesses and masts (the part that lifts the pallet).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This intimate product knowledge significantly reduces client downtime due to maintenance, repair and parts replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams also have the ability to quickly adjust concepts during the design stages and provide supporting tools that lead to increased productivity, operator comfort, safety and better fleet management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have one of the lowest life-cycle costs in the industry,&amp;rdquo; DeGrandchamp says, claiming customers are willing to invest in the quality of Crown trucks and service because they feel it will benefit them with cost avoidance in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Flexible enough to change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s impressive history of growth stems from its leaders&amp;rsquo; keen awareness of changing technology and market trends combined with a corporate culture that has embraced flexibility and challenge. A continuous focus on effectively satisfying changing customer needs is a hallmark of Total Quality Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s commitment to using formal quality tools and strategies dates to the mid-1990s. Traditionally engaging conventional production-line manufacturing, Crown management became interested in the concept of &amp;ldquo;focused factory&amp;rdquo; manufacturing in 1996 as a way to increase productivity and competitiveness. Focused factory strategies enable plants to focus on limited, specific tasks. Utilizing a &amp;ldquo;cellular&amp;rdquo; model, this manufacturing approach arranges production facilities and floor labor into work cells, or multi-skilled teams, that manufacture complete products or complex components rather than single parts. Cellular manufacturing is an integral part of lean manufacturing, as it drastically reduces waste and duplication of effort. Properly trained teams can manage processes, defects, scheduling, equipment maintenance and other manufacturing issues more efficiently, and thus reduce waste of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s focused factory initiatives paved the way toward a formal commitment to lean manufacturing in 1999. A pilot project in the company&amp;rsquo;s New Knoxville, Ohio, motor plant brought such significant benefits that the company has since applied lean strategies to every process in every one of its facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Six Sigma: A winning strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The newest component of Crown&amp;rsquo;s quality management program is Six Sigma. While lean is the systematized corporate effort, company managers apply Six Sigma to certain projects as needed and as resources are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When you&amp;rsquo;re in a lean system,&amp;rdquo; explains Jeff Caudill, Crown&amp;rsquo;s main manufacturing leader for the New Bremen campus, &amp;ldquo;it may be that you have a problem that requires a more powerful problem-solving tool, and Six Sigma provides that tool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general terms, Six Sigma enables a company to address specific areas targeted for improvement by providing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A structure to identify root causes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Advanced tools to achieve desired outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma supports lean manufacturing by reducing variation and waste. Data-driven strategies focus on defect prevention, with no more than 3.4 defects allowed per million opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some quality experts refer to Six Sigma as a philosophy, while others consider it a methodology. The American Society for Quality (ASQ) identifies four basic themes common to Six Sigma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use of teams that are assigned well-defined projects that have direct impact on the organization&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training in &amp;ldquo;statistical thinking&amp;rdquo; at all levels and providing key people with extensive training in advanced statistics and project management. (These key individuals are designated as either green or black belts.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An emphasis on the &amp;ldquo;DMAIC&amp;rdquo; approach to problem solving &amp;ndash; define, measure, analyze, improve and control.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A management environment that supports these initiatives as a business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every Six Sigma project needs organizational support, and targeted Six Sigma training enables professionals at every level of a company to assist with implementation. At the organizational level, specially trained &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;executives&amp;rdquo; set the direction for selecting and deploying projects. At the project level, those professionals actually conducting projects and implementing improvements are &amp;ldquo;green belts&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;black belts,&amp;rdquo; depending on the level of training they have received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown initiated its Six Sigma program in 2005 with four-day &amp;ldquo;champion&amp;rdquo; training for key upper-level managers. Rather than addressing any particular challenge, the training was a natural extension of the ongoing improvement philosophy championed by company management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Green belt training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In late 2005, all of Crown&amp;rsquo;s U.S. business unit managers were invited to submit names of potential candidates for green belt training. Managers were directed to consider candidates who were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Personally motivated to do their best&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recognized to have a mathematical mind that would be well-suited to the statistical nature of the improvement effort&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Willing and able to pass an internally developed test on quality tools and statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Each candidate was required to suggest a project that would bring improvement to the company. Members of a Six Sigma steering committee ultimately selected 12 Crown employees to participate in the company&amp;rsquo;s green belt training and certification, basing selection primarily on the potential long-term benefits of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The green belt training was conducted at company headquarters by a certified ASQ trainer. Six Sigma green belt training is typically conducted in two week-long increments one month apart. The Crown sessions were held in October and November 2005. At about the same time, a half-dozen Crown employees from the company&amp;rsquo;s Kinston, N.C., facility attended similar training conducted at North Carolina State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both the ASQ and N.C. State training sessions followed similar formats. All of the green belt candidates presented basic details of their proposed projects to the group, and work began. Projects ranged from general process improvement to scrap reduction, improved machine operation and more efficient gas usage, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first week of training was devoted to strategizing how to organize resources and eliminate road blocks; the second week was devoted to creating PowerPoint presentations about each project that participants could take back to their local management to begin actual on-site implementation. At the end of the second week, participants took a four-hour 100-question exam about Six Sigma concepts and received certification upon passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Group participants continued to meet via teleconference every couple of weeks thereafter to ensure each of the projects remained on track. Each green belt was tasked with completion of a project within the following six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Black belt training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The next phase of Crown&amp;rsquo;s Six Sigma effort occurred the following year, with 15 individuals moving on to take black belt training. As in the green belt program, each participant suggested an improvement project for the group to undertake. Black belt projects focused on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Elimination of defects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Optimization of processes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Elimination of non-value-added steps, such as secondary handling of goods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improvement of overseas operations in order to eliminate secondary handling of goods in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also like the Green Belt program, participants represented varied experience levels and a range of disciplines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Manufacturing engineers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Quality engineers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Quality management system (QMS) trainers of machinists&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Quality technicians&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plant managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma black belts lead problem-solving projects by training and coaching project teams at their facilities. Black belts must thoroughly understand and use all aspects of the DMAIC model in accordance with Six Sigma principles. In addition, black belts must understand and use other key Six Sigma tools, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Quality function deployment (QFD)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Basic robust design process tools, including noise strategies, tolerance design and process capability tools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Design for X&amp;rdquo; strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s Black Belt training occurred in the New Bremen facilities during December 2006 and January 2007. Two certified ASQ trainers led the effort, which culminated with a four-hour, 150-question written exam for the 15 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Million-dollar results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Every successful quality improvement program has both tangible and intangible results &amp;ndash; concrete, measurable results (tangible), and beneficial though impossible to measure results (intangible), such as improved morale, increased loyalty, higher employee self-esteem and enhanced customer satisfaction. Crown has chosen to focus on tangible, hard savings for measuring the success of its Six Sigma efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, Crown&amp;rsquo;s green belt efforts have resulted in hard savings of $1.2 million for the company. The company&amp;rsquo;s black belt efforts have brought $285,000 in hard savings so far, with more expected as the projects proceed further. While the time requirement for the first 12 green belts to undertake training was a whopping 2,400 hours (total for all 12), the company has calculated that it has saved a little over $500 per hour for each hour spent in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Strongest tool&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s results indicate Six Sigma is the &amp;ldquo;strongest improvement tool you can use,&amp;rdquo; according to John Daeger, quality engineering manager of the New Bremen headquarters facilities. Company managers learned one important lesson, however: Timing is everything. While the green belt training rendered an almost immediate $1.2 million in savings, the black belt effort has moved at a much slower pace because of its timing and because participants weren&amp;rsquo;t assigned to the effort full time. As the black belt candidates didn&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to focus on their Six Sigma projects full time, the timelines languished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that demands have stabilized, Crown management is re-energizing the black belt effort. The team&amp;rsquo;s plan is to move the 15 projects from the process development stage into the implementation and control phases. Budgets have been approved to include full-time commitment to the black belt program. Full-time, dedicated positions are currently being filled for a master black belt and a black belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also has plans to train a minimum of 10 green belts each year, with the intent that the growing number of green belts will help spread training throughout all branches of the company. In the broader scope, the company is also evaluating how its Six Sigma and lean programs should work together for total ongoing quality improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the meantime, Crown has been recognized with numerous awards, including outstanding achievement in waste minimization and pollution prevention. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated Crown as a &amp;ldquo;Waste Minimization Partner,&amp;rdquo; one of only 27 in the country. The award recognizes the company&amp;rsquo;s success in substantially reducing the amount of hazardous waste involved in manufacturing by eliminating the chromium from paint formulations. Additional waste minimization occurred because of installation of a power painting operation. This equipment has reduced the generation of waste paint sludge and air emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown has also received the Governor&amp;rsquo;s Award in Ohio for Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention. One of only eight award recipients, Crown earned the nomination not only because of its actual achievements in pollution prevention, but also for serving as a role model for other industrial generators by demonstrating the feasibility of pollution prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The newest component of Crown Equipment Corporation&amp;rsquo;s quality management program is Six Sigma. While lean is the systematized corporate effort, company managers apply Six Sigma to certain projects as needed and as resources are available.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The company now has 18 certified Six Sigma green belts and 15 black belts in its North American manufacturing facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		To date, green belt efforts have resulted in hard savings of $1.2 million for Crown, and black belt efforts have brought $285,000 in hard savings, with more expected as the projects proceed further.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		While the time requirement for the first 12 green belts to undertake training was a whopping 2,400 hours (total for all 12), the company has calculated that it has saved a little more than $500 per hour for each hour spent in training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;U.S. manufacturing operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Like nearly all large manufacturers, Crown Equipment owns production facilities in several countries; however, the majority is still found stateside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New Bremen, Ohio (five plants)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Connersville, Ind.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Greencastle, Ind.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Kinston, N.C.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Celina, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fort Loramie, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New Knoxville, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Design for X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Six Sigma perspective views all work as processes that can be defined, measured, analyzed, improved and controlled. Processes require inputs (x) and produce outputs (y). If you control the inputs, you will control the outputs, generally expressed as y = f(x).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/MOTEy0YVpiE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Virtual benchmarking tour of lean Raytheon plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	Raytheon&amp;#39;s Integrated Air Defense Center (IADC) in Andover, Mass., began their continuous improvement journey in 2003 with a Raytheon Six Sigma initiative. This initiative began the evolution of a culture of continuous improvement, waste identification and waste elimination throughout the organization. The employees at the IADC recognized the importance of lean manufacturing and continued to implement best practices through the follow-on Lean Initiative for Value Excellence. Starting in 2005, the IADC focused even more acutely on Lean transformation by engaging every employee through a program they call Operational Excellence. The foundation for Operational Excellence is based on getting every employee engaged in the business and focused on eliminating waste through Total Employee Engagement (TEE).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Through the Operational Excellence model, the IADC has consistently improved quality and productivity throughout its processes. In recognition of their efforts, the Integrated Air Defense Center was awarded a 2008 North American Shingo Silver Medallion for Operational Excellence and is also a 2008 Environmental Protection Agency WasteWise Gold Achievement Award winner.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This Virtual Plan Tour Video highlights many diverse examples of continuous improvement that have been implemented through the cohesive efforts of the Raytheon workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A slice of Six Sigma and continuous improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of people shy away from learning and using Six Sigma as part of their continuous improvement efforts because they think it requires exceptional mathematic and statistical abilities to implement. Well, good news, that&amp;#39;s not true! But why should you add Six Sigma to your CI program? To reduce variation and improve reliability and repeatability in your processes thus avoiding the significant costs of poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Leading manufacturers reveal strategies that helped them thrive in tough times</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As rising industrial production drives the economic recovery, leading manufacturers detailed their successful rebound strategies at the 25th annual International Forum on Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) in Providence, R.I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DFMA results reported by ITT Aerospace, Hypertherm, IDEXX Laboratories, Boeing, Motorola, Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, QSI, Raymond, Rockwell Automation, Southco and others strongly supported this year&amp;rsquo;s theme &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Turning Point: Preparing for a New Manufacturing Future.&amp;rdquo; The data, in many cases, showed significant cuts in material, labor and assembly costs that enabled companies to stay competitive, even profitable, despite the economic downturn. Several presentations also emphasized how DFMA helped generate manufacturing profits without moving production away from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Seeing our customers from so many different industries emerging strongly from the recession is tangible proof of the power of early design analysis,&amp;rdquo; said Nick Dewhurst, Boothroyd Dewhurst executive vice president. &amp;ldquo;Over three decades, DFMA has provided dramatic, measurable results in each changing cycle of global competition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DFMA software helps engineers quantify manufacturing and assembly costs early in the development process to reduce part count and labor, increase assembly efficiency, and benchmark competitive designs and materials. The resulting savings significantly reduce product development cycle time &amp;ndash; reverberating down the supply chain from design through manufacturing and beyond to shipping and end-of-life. In the 25 years since the Forum began, users have reported an average of total product cost cuts of 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the highlights of achievement presented were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;QSI Corporation (industrial and vehicle display terminals): &lt;/strong&gt;20 to 40 percent projected reduction in manufacturing costs and 50 to 80 percent reduction in assembly time. Savings passed on to the customer with no negative impact on profits.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Raymond Corporation (fork lift trucks): &lt;/strong&gt;41 percent reduction in part cost from an outsourced to in-house manufactured component, and a five-year projected 250 percent ROI on a modular redesign of fork lift backrest brackets into more efficient, standard sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Rockwell Automation: &lt;/strong&gt;Used Six Sigma tools to illustrate the strong statistical relationship between the information generated by the DFMA software to what is experienced in the factory and to improve Rockwell Automation&amp;rsquo;s DFA process to ensure a consistent global deployment. Shared an example of a redesign where DFMA software was used to achieve a 60 percent reduction in part count.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;ITT Aerospace: &lt;/strong&gt;For a ball-valve example, 55 percent reduction in part count, 58 percent reduction in labor, 24 percent total product cost reduction and improvement to product quality and a doubling of production throughput as a result of lean design.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Southco: &lt;/strong&gt;Hinge redesign netted 33 percent reduction in part count and a total cost reduction of 53 percent, which enabled Southco to meet the customer&amp;rsquo;s price target and improve profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;IDEXX Laboratories (blood chemistry analyzer): &lt;/strong&gt;83 percent part count reduction, 75 percent reduction in assembly time, 40 percent reduction in weight with improvements in serviceability, reliability, inspection, documentation and purchasing management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;DFMA is a methodology to see things as they are, to define the problem, to ground people in the reality of the product and its parts,&amp;rdquo; said presenter Mike Shipulski, director of manufacturing at Hypertherm. &amp;ldquo;Once grounded, once the problem is defined, the solution &amp;ndash; half the cost, half the parts, half the time &amp;ndash; is real, and so are the savings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Companies realize that early use of DFMA maximizes their Lean and Six Sigma efforts in ways that go far beyond incremental improvements,&amp;rdquo; says Boothroyd Dewhurst president John Gilligan. &amp;ldquo;There are practical and achievable methods that help generate profits and distinguish oneself from the competition. Those who have stayed focused on these truths in recent years are emerging well-prepared for the manufacturing environment of the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Boothroyd Dewhurst Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Boothroyd Dewhurst was the first company to commercialize Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) methodologies and software tools, which make it possible to evaluate, estimate, and reduce the manufacturing cost of a product in the design phase through product simplification and cost estimation. Hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies, including Dell, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool, use DFMA to cut the costs of their manufactured products and achieve design innovation in their markets. The company was founded in 1983 and received the National Medal of Technology Award in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img src="cid:image003.jpg@01CB1790.C4E98980" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Image caption: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The design engineering team at Hypertherm (Headquartered in Lebanon, N.H.) used DFMA to achieve an overall reduction in part count of 27 percent on their next generation of metal cutting CNCs, while adding features and performance capability and holding the price of the new product steady.&amp;nbsp;On the manufacturing side, the team saw even bigger gains, with a 50 percent decrease in build and test time.&amp;nbsp; In addition&amp;mdash;with the improvements in reliability, durability and serviceability &amp;mdash; the team projected warranty cost-savings of 50 percent per unit and, as a result, recommended that the new EDGE Pro CNC have a two-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/IdxiRwxZKY0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IWCM to award 120 certifications to lean and Six Sigma grads</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Institute for World Class Manufacturing (IWCM), the education and training program operated by the &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dvirc.org&amp;amp;esheet=6338977&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Delaware+Valley+Industrial+Resource+Center+%28DVIRC%29&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=a61f75ce035e140560c6084bfe6d5378" target="_blank"&gt;Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center (DVIRC)&lt;/a&gt;, will honor 120 newly certified Lean and Six Sigma graduates at a ceremony to be held at the Whitemarsh Valley Country Club on Thursday, June 24 from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The event will include the presentation of an award to Thomas Medical Products Inc., a Malvern, Pa., medical device company for their leadership in assisting other local manufacturers in harnessing the power of Lean methodologies to increase profitability, and set the stage for growth. Building a cluster of manufacturers committed to Lean strengthens the region&amp;rsquo;s overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The graduates have completed a dozen courses in a range of disciplines critical to proficiency in continuous improvement training including Principles of Lean Manufacturing, Value Stream Mapping and Cellular Manufacturing. The training was held in locations all across the Philadelphia area spanning several months and included &amp;ldquo;hands-on&amp;rdquo; training and tours of manufacturing facilities in the region. Traditionally confined to the plant floor, Lean has grown in popularity with the restructuring of the economy, and is now carried through the entire organization structure. Graduates Thursday will range from technicians to CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is truly an impressive program,&amp;rdquo; says Joe Houldin, CEO of Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center. &amp;ldquo;We are seeing increased demand for our Lean educational services. It is no longer the exclusive domain of manufacturing. We are seeing companies in other sectors, such as healthcare, beginning to adopt lean to right size their business in an effort to improve their productivity. This latest class is at the tip of the spear in terms of a new management strategy focused on increasing profitability to fuel future growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Institute for World Class Manufacturing is the only learning organization devoted exclusively to Manufacturing Excellence in the Greater Philadelphia area. Since 1995, the program has engaged more than 2,800 people from more than 550 area manufacturers in performance-driven certifications, workshops and on-site learning programs. Of that, some 1,800 graduates have gone to apply their training in area businesses in positions as varied as plant floor technicians to middle management and CFOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean is a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste (non-value added activities) and creating value for the customer. Lean Transformation typifies the best in leadership, culture, strategy and operational excellence that defines advanced manufacturers today. DVIRC has executed more than 600 projects for very small, 30 person firms, to large multi-plant global businesses working on three continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About DVIRC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	DVIRC is a leading private, non-profit economic development organization established in 1988 to serve the needs of nearly 5,000 small to mid-sized advanced manufacturing enterprises (SME) in five counties throughout the Philadelphia region. The organization&amp;rsquo;s primary focus is to grow business value for clients through consulting services, talent development and regional, state and federal resource assistance, helping to establish the region as an internationally recognized leader in manufacturing competitiveness. We believe growing business value improves the standard of living and quality of life for those that live and/or work in the region. A diverse board of directors comprised of executives from the manufacturing, banking, legal and economic development communities govern the DVIRC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/3apHpm4i3FI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Xerox ink facility embraces process improvement</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Members of Xerox&amp;rsquo;s leadership are principal advocates for using Lean Six Sigma to institute change in everyday decision making involving everything from manufacturing to finance. Under visible commitment from former and current CEOs Anne Mulcahy and Ursula Burns, there has been a cultural shift at Xerox toward making Lean Six Sigma inherent in everyday project selection and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solid ink Jetstack operation team in Wilsonville, Ore., is a marked example of the progression from initial adoption of Lean Six Sigma ideas to embedded principles in operations that are driving business results for Xerox. Solid ink technology utilizes solid ink sticks in lieu of fluid ink or toner powder. After the ink stick is loaded into the printing device, it is melted and used to produce images on paper in a process similar to offset printing. Jetstacks are stainless steel plates that route ink from reservoirs to the jets that dispense the ink from the printer. The steps in the manufacturing process of Jetstacks are detailed and precise, and the team has recently completed several Lean Six Sigma projects that optimize the manufacturing process to meet the strict requirements in a more efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first project addressed the clean room portion of the Jetstack manufacturing. The team needed to add new equipment to increase capacity, but had little floor space to do so. Increased capacity also created a prime opportunity to identify overall efficiency improvement opportunities. Lean Six Sigma black belts from other Xerox locations visited Wilsonville to lend expertise, providing training and project guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A DMA (define-measure-analyze) blitz, commonly called a kaizen, was used for the project &amp;ndash; leveraging Lean Six Sigma tools in a condensed time period to deliver immediate, tangible results. The team began by mapping the Jetstack manufacturing process step by step for a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of constraints and areas of the process which presented opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the team was ready to make informed, knowledge-based recommendations, a brainstorm led to approximately 200 improvement ideas. A benefit/effort matrix was used to identify the solutions that would make the most impact. End results included 220 reclaimed square feet of room for new equipment and more than $1 million in capital savings due to reduced cycle times and improved efficiencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By the time a second project was initiated, the team had matured to the point of training employees and leading projects independently. The cultural shift toward making Lean Six Sigma &amp;ldquo;the way of work&amp;rdquo; had eliminated the need to obtain black belt resources from other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The pre-clean room manufactures a part of the Jetstack system proprietary to Xerox. The Lean Six Sigma project aimed to build on the success of the clean room kaizen by increasing throughput in the pre-clean room without investing in additional equipment. Further goals of the project included reducing opportunities for injury, scrap and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team was able to reduce scrap, improve organization and create a more efficient use of floor space and labor, saving Xerox approximately $450,000. The project also helped reduce negative impact on the environment by adding recycling efforts and identifying unnecessary power consumption. In addition, the team met the goal of decreasing opportunities for employee injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having Lean Six Sigma expertise in-house at the Wilsonville facility has been a valuable asset, allowing the team to review the operation as a comprehensive system and deliver significantly more efficient and robust processes. Before Wilsonville built a strong, Lean Six Sigma-trained team, these inefficiencies may have fallen through the cracks. But now, they are addressed and optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ASQ adds master black belt certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The American Society for Quality (ASQ) is now offering professionals the &lt;a href="http://www.asq.org/certification/master-black-belt/index.html" jquery1274468238828="83"&gt;ASQ Master Black Belt Certification&lt;/a&gt;, a new addition joining the society&amp;rsquo;s 18 certification programs available around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This newest certification is aimed at individuals who seek a universally recognized professional credential to affirm their experience, expertise and knowledge of current quality industry practices. Across all business sectors and industries, Master Black Belts (MBB) are recognized and serve in key leadership posts focused on improving results through Six Sigma principles, teamwork and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To become certified as an ASQ Master Black Belt, a candidate must meet requirements that include a portfolio review and approval. To be eligible to apply for the MBB exam, a candidate must hold a current ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB). ASQ will waive the requirement of holding a &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; ASQ CSSBB through December 31, 2011, for those applicants whose ASQ CSSBB certification has expired. In addition, a candidate must have either of the following experience levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		At least five years of experience in the role of a SSBB or MBB; or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A portfolio of 10 completed Six Sigma Black Belt projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After candidates have met these minimum requirements, they are eligible to have their portfolio of Six Sigma Black Belt and MBB work reviewed. After the candidate&amp;rsquo;s portfolio is reviewed and approved, the candidate may apply and sit for the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As organizations increasingly look to ASQ to assist them in establishing professional standards, it became essential to add the Master Black Belt,&amp;quot; said Paul Borawski, ASQ executive director and chief strategic officer. &amp;quot;Achieving this level of certification enables candidates to gain a level of professionalism that can help to bolster their careers and advance their organizational goals. And lend confidence to organizations in the qualifications of their Six Sigma professionals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first administration of the ASQ MBB certification exam is scheduled for August 28, 2010. The portfolio submission deadline is June 8, 2010, with an exam application deadline of August 6, 2010. The next opportunity to take this exam will be in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Alphabet soup of management: Is there a recipe for change?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ITIL, Six Sigma, Lean, TQM, Agile Development, Scrum, XP, APM, PMBOK, strategy maps, portfolio management, and the list goes on and on. How does anyone make sense of all the management mantras? The reality is that most do not. The average organization will attempt to implement three of these, or other management techniques, every two years. Each initiative will cost approximately $750,000 and will be cancelled within 12 months. Yet, the management problems these ideas were undertaken to solve will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an organizational leader tirelessly attempting to keep your firm moving forward, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, retain your most valuable employees, plus address 20 other major strategic and operational goals, what are you to do? The key to wading through the myriad of mantras is to keep your focus on what really matters. Remembering a few simple rules can dramatically improve your chances of success. First, process won&amp;rsquo;t get you there, people will. And second, strategy drives your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In almost every situation, the first thing a new leader instinctively wants to do when they walk in the door is change something. They cannot help themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s the simple logic of self-preservation. In most situations, the new leader is replacing a leader that was dismissed from the organization. If they keep everything the same, logic dictates they will end up in the same position as the previous leader. Therefore, the only logical course is to change something, put the leader&amp;rsquo;s imprint on the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
	For many leaders, this leads to some sort of process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Six Sigma, Lean, Agile Six Sigma or Total Quality Management (TQM) are all examples of continuous process improvement initiatives. Agile Development &amp;ndash; and specifically Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Agile Project Management (APM) or Crystal Clear &amp;ndash; are all represent popular information technology development methodologies. The Project Management Body of Knowledge, or PMBOK, represents the writings for the field of project management consolidated in the Project Management Institute&amp;rsquo;s PMBOK Guide. Finally, strategy maps and the like are best expressed by the work of Robert S. Kaplan. Each of these represents a process that an organization might select to try and change current performance. The numbers say most will fail. However, it is the reason for failure that is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases, when a leader brings a new process to the organization, they achieve a reasonable amount of initial success. Everyone seems on board with the new processes. Meetings are being scheduled and attended according to the plan. There is apparent energy and excitement with the initial results. Then somewhere around months six through nine, the wheels seem to fall off. Those once grand processes are no longer being followed without constant reminders. The once-promising investment is simply not paying dividends. Is this a failure of process? Maybe it is a problem with your people. You simply have the wrong people in the wrong jobs. The truth is it&amp;rsquo;s a failure of leadership &amp;ndash; yours. Unless you correct the problem quickly, you are going to become part of the ever-increasing list of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem in these situations is too heavy a reliance on detailed process, and too little attention being paid to your staff taking ownership of the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have ever read anything on change management or taken any training on the topic, you have likely learned about the supposed importance of buy-in. Getting buy-in is a great idea if you are a change consultant, but fails miserably for organizational leaders in the real world. The problem comes from understanding what buy-in truly represents. Buy-in is the leader selling organizational members the leader&amp;rsquo;s ideas for how the organization should be run or changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The problem with buy-in is that the buyer can always choose to buy-out. This occurs when the change is no longer new, cool or sexy. It also happens when team members feel they have become bogged down in process and can no longer remember why the process was created in the first place. Two things have to occur to resolve this problem. First, leaders must ensure focus is always on the end goal. This requires constant reminders. Secondly, leaders must ensure the process does not become rote and overly cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A good process should never try to account for every contingency. The target of a good process is to account for 90 percent of the cases and then give your people the latitude to deal with the last 10 percent. Remember, the tendency of most people is to keep their heads down, assuming that if they do not get noticed, the change initiative will eventually lose steam and they can go back to doing things the way they always have. People do this because they have no ownership in the idea. It&amp;rsquo;s your idea, so when they get tired or frustrated, it is easy to revert back to the old ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key to instilling a sense of ownership is understanding the relationship strategy has in the process. Strategy represents the plan created achieve the long-range organizational objectives. For many leaders, strategy is their domain. It is not the domain of the average worker. Unfortunately, this opinion ensures the strategy is never achieved. The true objective of an organizational strategy is to loudly and clearly state, &amp;ldquo;This is who we are and where we are going.&amp;rdquo; Every member of the organization must feel a sense of ownership in the strategy and be able to express how their personal actions impact the strategy. In other words, they must be able to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;How do I fit in?&amp;rdquo; This cannot be done by having the senior leadership hand down the strategy from on high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	True leaders understand the importance of getting every member of the team to take ownership of their actions and the strategy. This requires more than an alphabet soup of process; it requires an owned strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Process improvement: Where it fails, and how to resolve it</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703298004574457471313938130.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines"&gt;Where process improvement projects go wrong&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; the author made very good points about issues with Six Sigma and lean process improvement programs. However, his points relate not only to Lean Six Sigma efforts but to other improvement efforts as well &amp;ndash; e.g., Total Quality Management (TQM) and Deming&amp;rsquo;s Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle structured efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen similar issues like those described by the author and agree that his deployment-improvement efforts can help reduce the magnitude of the issue; however, I think that there are additional points that should be highlighted, and an additional focus should be made to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The methodology that I will later describe involves a business system resolution, which integrates process improvement efforts with a blending of an enhanced predictive scorecard system that includes analytically/innovatively determined strategies so that process improvement changes positively impact the business as a whole. This approach is in contrast to the commonplace brainstorming for projects that results in the creation of silo projects that in isolation appear beneficial but do not in reality positively impact the business as a whole (e.g., we saved $100 million but nobody can find the money). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The issue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The author of the WSJ article points out how improvement efforts can start well with generated excitement and progress but often fail to have long-lasting impact. The author builds an analogy between process improvement programs and a spring&amp;rsquo;s stress-strain curve &amp;ndash; stretching, yielding and failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Stretching phase: &lt;/strong&gt;In a sited example, top executives were paying close attention to the project managers and made it clear to employees that the improvement initiative was their top priority. When teams reached their goal, the improvement project was declared a success. The spearheading director shared the benefits of the company&amp;rsquo;s Six Sigma initiatives with others in the company. Team members were given public rewards and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Yielding phase: &lt;/strong&gt;If one were to pull continually on a metal spring, the metal&amp;rsquo;s yield point would be exceeded, which would result in permanent deformation. Similarly, when the process improvement expert moves on to another project, and top management turns its focus elsewhere, implementation difficulties start occurring, and he finds it difficult to maintain previous achieved gains. Amid confusion and facing day-to-day pressures, some team members started reverting to old ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Failing stage: &lt;/strong&gt;If one were to continually pull, the spring would become smaller and smaller in one area until it cannot sustain any additional pressure and breaks. This is not unlike the final stage of a process improvement project where team members find that they are unable or unwilling to tackle improvement tasks, which leads to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With these project failures, teams often report achievements incorrectly; i.e., the sense of success is false. In addition, the director often communicates about successful projects that show benefits; hence, it can take some period of time before the division vice president becomes aware of widespread failures and then reluctantly informs company top executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The article then describes four things that can be done to improve the likelihood of success from improvement projects. I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree with the four points that the author makes; however, I think that there are additional issues that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A business system resolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Again, I agree with process improvement issues that were described in the article. However, I think that there are additional issues such as project selection, getting the right people to become the Lean Six Sigma expert, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, I suggest for success that process improvement efforts need to be part of an overall enhanced business management system. This structured business system needs to integrate predictive scorecards with targeted strategy creation that integrates analytics with innovation, and which leads to the creation of functional goals that pull for the creation of improvement projects that benefit the enterprise as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The financials of an enterprise are a result of the integration and interaction of its processes, not of individual procedures in isolation. Using a whole-system perspective, one realizes that the output of a system is a function of its weakest link or constraint. If care is not exercised, one can be focusing on a subsystem that, even though improved, does not impact the overall system big-picture output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Lean Six Sigma and lean kaizen event programs, improvement projects are often selected from a list of potential opportunities that were determined from a brainstorming session. This effort might provide some initial gains when starting a deployment; however, this effort typically stalls out, and the process improvement teams are laid off when times get tough. The reason for this downsizing is that often process improvement efforts are not expended in areas where the overall enterprise benefits the most; e.g., sales and marketing when excess production capacity is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Process improvement efforts need to focus on the orchestration of efforts so that this work concentrates on overall system optimization, not on individual procedure component improvement. Unfortunately, organizational-chart-functional thinking can result in competing forces for process improvement labors, where much of this work does not benefit the enterprise as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With theory of constraints (TOC), systems are viewed as a whole, and work activities are directed so that whole-system-performance measures are improved. To illustrate this, consider the system that is shown in Figure 1. Similar to water flow through a garden hose, the squeezing of one portion of the hose reduces water flow volume (i.e., Step 5 in the figure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;From Figure 10.1 &lt;em&gt;Intergrated Enterprise Excellence, Volume II - Business Deployment: A Leader&amp;#39;s Guide for Going Beyond Lean Six Sigma and the Balanced Scorecard,&lt;/em&gt; Forrest W. Breyfogle III, Bridgeway Books, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without considering the whole system, we might be spending a great deal of time and effort working on Process Step 2 because this step is not meeting its localized-created target objectives relative to operating efficiencies, equipment utilization, etc. If we consider the figure to represent a series of departments through which a transaction is processed, where each step has a separate manager who is trying to support a strategy to improve the capacity of the business, without the theory of constraints concept, each department would apply resources to improve its step only. This would create a situation in which only one-sixth of the improvement resources are being applied to the single location that is limiting the system capacity. From this figure, we note that improvements to Process Step 2 will not significantly impact the overall system and may actually degrade the overall metrics if additional work in process (WIP) is created from the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The TOC system chain extends from market demand through the organization chain to suppliers. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example when this high-level view of the overall system is not addressed. An organization works at improving internal process efficiencies. Capacity then increases. Excess inventory is then created because there is not sufficient demand. It is then discovered that the constraint is really the sales and marketing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Within an organization, there are often constraints that we may or may not consider. Types of constraints include market, resource, material, supplier, financial and knowledge/competency. We need to look at the rules (i.e., policies) that drive the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Theory of constraints&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In this example, I will use terms typically associated with manufacturing; however, the concepts apply equally to transactional processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/Breyfogle002.gif " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt; System constraint identification and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;From Figure 10.1 &lt;em&gt;Intergrated Enterprise Excellence, Volume II - Business Deployment: A Leader&amp;#39;s Guide for Going Beyond Lean Six Sigma and the Balanced Scorecard,&lt;/em&gt; Forrest W. Breyfogle III, Bridgeway Books, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A simple system is shown in Figure 2. Raw materials are processed through four component steps to produce a finished product. Each process step is an overall value stream link. The capacity of each step is described in the figure along with the market demand of 105 units per day. The goal is to make as much money as possible from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the examination of Situation 1 in the figure, it is noted that the capacity of Step C is 75, which is less than the market demand of 105. Even though other steps in our value stream process may not be performing up to their equipment utilization and efficiency goals, focus should be given first to increasing the capacity of Step C. From this enterprise-system analysis, Step C would be an opportunity for a Lean Six Sigma improvement project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon completion of this project for Step C, the process then exhibited the characteristics of Situation 2 shown in the figure. An analysis of this situation indicates that the constraint is now at Step A. From this enterprise system analysis, it would now be appropriate for a Lean Six Sigma project to focus on Step A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Upon completion of a Lean Six Sigma project of Step A, the process then started exhibiting the characteristics of Situation 3. An analysis of this situation indicates that all four steps of the process have enough capacity to meet the market demand. The internal system constraints relative to satisfying a market demand of 115 units per day have been removed. The constraint has moved outside the system to the marketplace. The next Lean Six Sigma project should focus on determining what can be done to increase product demand through improvements in the marketing and sales processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This example illustrated the importance of starting by analyzing the big picture to determine where efforts should focus when creating projects. Losing sight of the big picture can lead to the ineffective utilization of resources and the sub-optimization of processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcomings of traditional process improvement efforts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The implementation of traditional Total Quality Management (TQM) and Lean Six Sigma has often been accomplished by dividing the system into processes and then optimizing the quality of each process. This approach is preferable to chasing symptoms; however, new problems can be created if the individual process is not considered in concert with other processes that it affects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The theory of constraints approach focuses on reducing system bottlenecks as a means to improve the performance of the entire system continually. Rather than viewing the system in terms of discrete processes, TOC addresses the larger systematic picture as a chain or grid of interlinked chains. The performance of the weakest link determines the performance of the whole chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/strong&gt; The Integrated Enterprise Excellence System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;From Figure 4.7 &lt;em&gt;Intergrated Enterprise Excellence, Volume II - Business Deployment: A Leader&amp;#39;s Guide for Going Beyond Lean Six Sigma and the Balanced Scorecard,&lt;/em&gt; Forrest W. Breyfogle III, Bridgeway Books, 2008.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TOC considers three dimensions of system performance in the following order: throughput (total sales revenues minus the total variable costs for producing a product or service), inventory (all the money which a company invests in items it sells), and operating expense (money a company spends transforming inventory into throughput). Focus on these dimensions can lead a company to abandon traditional management cost accounting while at the same time causing an improvement in competitive price advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application of TOC in an overall business system&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Other articles describe the following aspects of the nine-step Integrated Enterprise Excellence (IEE) business-management-governance system, as illustrated in Figure 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;
		IEE Step 5: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.smartersolutions.com/pdfs/online_database/article162.htm"&gt;The Balanced Scorecard: Issues and Resolution&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TOC would be part of the Integrated Enterprise Excellence &amp;ldquo;analyze enterprise&amp;rdquo; (Step 3), which would provide input to the following sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determination of realistic business financial goals (Step 4).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Creation of analytically/innovatively determined targeted strategies (Step 5).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification of potential improvement focused areas (Step 6).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recognition of targeted projects so that the business as a whole benefits (Step 7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The integration of TOC within the Integrated Enterprise Excellence system provides an overall business-management system so that Lean Six Sigma and lean kaizen events improve the overall enterprise financials. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An article that describes this system in more detail is: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.smartersolutions.com/pdfs/online_database/article128.htm"&gt;C-Suite: The Need to Re-think our Business System&amp;rsquo;s Strategic Planning, Scorecard Creation, and Process Improvement Efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; The following books provide execution details for the article-described system at the business-implementation and project-execution levels:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mosaic rapid Lean Six Sigma team saves over $12 million, wins award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Mosaic Company, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest phosphate fertilizer producer, was honored with the Top Award for Best Process Improvement Project Completed in 90 Days at the recent IQPC Lean Six Sigma and Process Excellence Summit held in Orlando, Fla. The winning Mosaic Lean Six Sigma Team bested competing teams from more than 30 companies including Best Buy, Delphi, Dominion Energy, GE and Whirlpool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mosaic has been invested in Lean Six Sigma since its founding in 2004 when Cargill and International Minerals Corporation merged operations. However, Mosaic has taken a different approach to continuous improvement by deploying an innovative, &amp;quot;hybrid&amp;quot; version of Lean Six Sigma that leverages a small staff of Black Belts trained in advanced data analysis tools with a 60-day Rapid Action Team Process that taps the knowledge and creativity of frontline workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008 alone, Mosaic used this Rapid Lean Six Sigma approach to deploy more than 45 teams, engage more than 500 employees and deliver close to $25 million in financial benefits to the company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The winning team, called &amp;quot;The Wingate Floaters,&amp;quot; was commissioned to improve rock recovery at Mosaic&amp;rsquo;s Wingate Creek Mining Operation in central Florida.&amp;nbsp;The black belt assigned to coach the team of mining operators, mechanics, lab techs and supervisors facilitated a process mapping and cause and effect analysis to focus attention on the most leveraged areas for exploring rock recovery improvement opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From here the Rapid Action Team took the reins by brainstorming and testing ideas using a disciplined process that balances &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; thinking with practical cost/benefit analysis. The team considered more than 40 improvement ideas and took immediate action on several of the most promising. Within 30 days, rock recovery improved from 47 percent to over 68 percent &amp;hellip; the result of simple changes in the production process that only those close to the operation could see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The implementation of additional ideas that required equipment changes increased recovery rates to more than 80 percent. As a result, an operation that may have been targeted for shut-down has gained new life along with an energized workforce that is continuing to make improvements through ongoing participation on Rapid Action Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Joe Gliksman, master black belt for Mosaic, combining traditional Lean Six Sigma tools with the Rapid Action Team Process is a win/win for the company, particularly in these tough economic times. &amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of training an army of Belts to solve problems. With Rapid Action Tools we can engage our employees on a just-when-needed basis as improvements opportunities arise. As a result, our Belts can focus on what they do best, data analysis and coaching, and our employees get to share, test and implement their own ideas.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>What's the role of the reliability engineer?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" hspace="7" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/12/20/45cc81b2-8183-421e-a611-a5ce00088b73_Fotolia_40410101_XS.jpeg" vspace="7" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The primary role of the reliability engineer is to identify and manage asset reliability risks that could adversely affect plant or business operations. This broad primary role can be divided into three smaller, more manageable roles: loss elimination, risk management and life cycle asset management (LCAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loss Elimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the fundamental roles of the reliability engineer is to track the production losses and abnormally high maintenance cost assets, then find ways to reduce those losses or high costs. These losses are prioritized to focus efforts on the largest/most critical opportunities. The reliability engineer (in full partnership with the operations team) develops a plan to eliminate or reduce the losses through root cause analysis, obtains approval of the plan and facilitates the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Another role of the reliability engineer is to manage risk to the achievement of an organization&amp;rsquo;s strategic objectives in the areas of environmental health and safety, asset capability, quality and production. Some tools used by a reliability engineer to identify and reduce risk include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		PHA &amp;ndash; Preliminary hazards analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		FMEA &amp;ndash; Failure modes and effects analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		CA &amp;ndash; Criticality analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		SFMEA &amp;ndash; Simplified failure modes and effects analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		MI &amp;ndash; Maintainability information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		FTA &amp;ndash; Fault tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		ETA &amp;ndash; Event tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Cycle Asset Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Studies show that as much as 95 percent of the total cost of ownership (TCO) or life cycle cost (LCC) of an asset is determined before it is put into use. This reveals the need for the reliability engineer to be involved in the design and installation stages of projects for new assets and modification of existing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reliability Engineer Responsibilities and Duties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of responsibilities and duties commonly found in the job description of a reliability engineer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Works with project engineering to ensure the reliability and maintainability of new and modified installations. The reliability engineer is responsible for adhering to the life cycle asset management (LCAM) process throughout the entire life cycle of new assets.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Participates in the development of design and installation specifications along with commissioning plans. Participates in the development of criteria for and evaluation of equipment and technical MRO suppliers and technical maintenance service providers. Develops acceptance tests and inspection criteria.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Participates in the final check-out of new installations. This includes factory and site acceptance testing that will assure adherence to functional specifications.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Guides efforts to ensure reliability and maintainability of equipment, processes, utilities, facilities, controls and safety/security systems.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Professionally and systematically defines, designs, develops, monitors and refines an asset maintenance plan that includes:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Value-added preventive maintenance tasks&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Effective utilization of predictive and other non-destructive testing methodologies designed to identify and isolate inherent reliability problems&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provides input to a risk management plan that will anticipate reliability-related and non-reliability-related risks that could adversely impact plant operations.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develops engineering solutions to repetitive failures and all other problems that adversely affect plant operations. These problems include capacity, quality, cost or regulatory compliance issues. To fulfill this responsibility, the reliability engineer applies:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Data analysis techniques that can include:
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Statistical process control&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Reliability modeling and prediction&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Fault tree analysis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Weibull analysis&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;
						Six Sigma (6&amp;sigma;) methodology&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Root cause analysis (RCA) and root cause failure analysis (RCFA)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Failure reporting, analysis and corrective action system (FRACAS)&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Works with Production to perform analyses of assets including:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Asset utilization&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Overall equipment effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Remaining useful life&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Other parameters that define operating condition, reliability and costs of assets&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Provides technical support to production, maintenance management and technical personnel.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Applies value analysis to repair/replace, repair/redesign and make/buy decisions.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Why lean efforts fail: Views from a 25-year plant leader</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you think about it, there are really only a few companies that can be considered lean: Toyota, Honda and Danaher. The rest of the companies that embark on a lean journey, in my opinion, seem to only dabble with lean tools when they are convenient, and then the efforts fade away over time. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising because lean thinking has been mainstream for more than a decade and there are thousands of people who have been trained and understand lean principles. Jim Womack and the Lean Enterprise team have done a great job as thought leaders; and in the book &amp;ldquo;The Toyota Way&amp;rdquo;, Jeffrey Liker has broken the Toyota Production System down to its essence. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I visit many companies each year, and even in some of the worst, I am often surprised to find someone there who has had lean training. They are usually able to talk about waste or single-piece flow, but I leave wondering what happened. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t the lean activity continue? Why was there no follow-through? Many times during plant tours, you will see evidence of lean tucked in the corner or off in the back. I wish I had a dollar for every unused andon signal, heijunka board or employee glass wall that I have seen set aside and gathering dust.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What always amazes me is how gracious Toyota is about sharing its philosophy, thoughts and lean tools to anyone willing to visit its plants and listen. The company is safe, knowing that the knowledge it provides to others will either never be acted upon or will be started but not sustained. I know when I revisit Toyota plants each year that the same standard work and continuous improvement processes are in place.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	At most companies, lean is usually introduced into the manufacturing organization and gains some quick wins using common tools out on the shop floor. However, the effort eventually gets bogged down since it requires support from the other functions as the implementation process moves to the next level. Top leadership either does not understand it or is unwilling to embrace the philosophy. Eventually, the lean activity fades away as knowledgeable people attrite over time, the operations team changes or short-term priorities become the order of the day.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Other problems can take their toll on businesses during their lean journey, such as failure to address fundamental structural issues. After years of learning from Toyota, General Motors had some of the leanest factories in the world, but it failed to address an uncompetitive wage and benefit structure and the need to market compelling products. Consequently, the lean plants were shut down due to lack of demand.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Over the years, I have observed some of the reasons for this lean fanfare-and-fade phenomenon. You can probably add your own thoughts to this list, but here is my best shot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Not used as an overall business philosophy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		People vs. process dependent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Use of &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; only&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		All functions aren&amp;rsquo;t committed or involved&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Conflicting metrics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Good for the plant, but not for senior leaders (it has to start at the top)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Forgetting the front and back end of the business (suppliers, customer demand and inventory strategy)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Home run mentality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, when you really dig into it, the basic reason why the implementation of lean fails at most companies boils down to culture. Not Japanese vs. American, but the corporate culture and how the company is led from the top. What most leaders fail to realize is that lean is a management philosophy, not simply a collection of tools for material and information flow or problem solving. And, most corporate leaders either do not understand its value or do not have the patience and control to implement it. Slow, steady continuous improvement does not lead to immediate recognition, quick promotions or soaring share prices. Successful implementation requires something that is very rare in both people and organizations: constancy of purpose. However, if you stick with it, it is amazing how the little day-to-day improvements add up over time; after a few months, you look back and realize how much has been accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The problem is that at most companies, managers are still looking for the &amp;ldquo;big bang&amp;rdquo; project or turbocharged effort of their employees. They all sound good and come with great fanfare or personal sacrifice, but they are usually not sustainable.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I often remember meeting employees during my visits to Toyota and Honda plants. I expected to meet really outstanding individuals. Those companies do employ good people, but what I found were people like myself working in a structure that elevated their efforts and supported their success. The companies created an environment that allowed ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results over time by having consistent direction and standardized work processes, both in the office and in the shop. Citing one of the principles of W. Edwards Deming, their success was more dependent on process than the effort of an individual person.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the author:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Curtiss Quirin is a business executive with more than 25 years of experience leading manufacturing operations. During his career at General Motors, Delphi and The Stanley Works, he was permitted a wide scope of autonomy directing many diverse functions, including: manufacturing, industrial engineering, sales and marketing, finance, and supply chain management.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	His lean experience stems from his Toyota Production System training from both Toyota senseis and at the NUMMI assembly plant. He has deployed lean techniques on the factory floor &amp;ndash; from single-cell kaizen workshops to improving the value stream across multiple plants. Factories that he has managed are suppliers to Toyota, Honda, General Motors, International Truck and many aftermarket customers.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As the plant manager of a large generator factory, he was able to reverse a plant loss of $22 million to a profit of $8 million in two years. This was accomplished by utilizing value stream mapping, decoupling operations, cellular manufacturing, establishing managed buffers, kanban material flow and standardized work.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As a practitioner/consultant, he has implemented and taught the Toyota Production System at companies in a wide variety of industries, including Alberto Culver, American Axle, Art Iron, Canyon Creek Cabinets, Parker Chelsea, Pentair, Werner Ladder and Signature Seating.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Curtiss is a certified Green Belt Six Sigma problem-solver, and has written and published several articles on lean.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Lean crushing Six Sigma as dominant force in corporate continuous improvement </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After years of steady gains, lean has now achieved a clear and dominant standing over Six Sigma as the leading force in corporate continuous improvement, according to the latest study of almost 3,500 recent job postings reviewed by The Avery Point Group (&lt;a href="http://www.averypointgroup.com/" target="_newbrowser"&gt;http://www.averypointgroup.com/&lt;/a&gt;), a leading global executive search and recruiting firm for lean and Six Sigma talent. The now dominant standing of Lean indicates that companies are increasingly relying on lean as the core foundation for their continuous improvement efforts to help them face the challenges of today&amp;#39;s economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As an executive recruiting firm, we have a unique vantage point from which to observe the latest trends taking place in industry,&amp;quot; says Tim Noble, managing principal of The Avery Point Group. &amp;quot;Trends in industry are often telegraphed into candidate requirements in job postings, and they can serve as a window into the latest corporate initiatives. Our annual study continues to serve as an industry benchmark that offers useful insight into the latest trends taking place in the area of corporate continuous improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on its sixth annual study (&lt;a href="http://www.leansigmatalent.com/" target="_newbrowser"&gt;http://www.leansigmatalent.com/&lt;/a&gt;) of Internet job postings, The Avery Point Group found that demand for lean talent has surpassed Six Sigma by a substantial margin as the more desired skill set, accelerating an already growing shift in talent demand toward lean. This year&amp;#39;s study showed that lean talent demand exceeded Six Sigma by almost 35 percent, significantly widening its lead over last year&amp;#39;s results that only showed an 11 percent edge for lean over Six Sigma. This is a dramatic shift from The Avery Point Group&amp;#39;s 2005 inaugural lean and Six Sigma talent demand study that showed Six Sigma talent demand exceeding lean by more than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s study also found that for those companies seeking lean talent, only 41 percent require candidates to possess Six Sigma knowledge as well, a requirement that has continued to decline in The Avery Point Group&amp;#39;s more recent talent demand studies. On the other hand, for those companies seeking Six Sigma talent, almost 55 percent are now requiring candidates to possess lean knowledge as well, a requirement that has steadily grown in its previous talent demand studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;For companies seeking lean practitioners, these results may be signaling a possible trend toward a decoupling of lean and Six Sigma, or at the very least a de-emphasis on Six Sigma as a core job requirement for lean talent,&amp;quot; states Noble. &amp;quot;It may also indicate that companies are instead opting to consolidate their limited resources around lean as a hedge against the steep challenges of today&amp;#39;s economic climate, which they feel may be better served by lean&amp;#39;s more immediate and practical focus on waste, flow and flexibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, this year&amp;#39;s study focused on how requirements for certifications played into job specifications for lean and Six Sigma talent. This year&amp;#39;s study found that companies which sought Six Sigma talent were almost 50 percent more likely to require some form of certification vs. those companies seeking lean talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;From a Six Sigma talent demand perspective, this is by no means a surprise,&amp;quot; states Noble. &amp;quot;Six Sigma, due to its broader historical industry span, developed a legacy of training and certification that we are now just beginning to see for lean as it gains a broader foothold in industry. A good example of this is the newly established benchmark AME/SME/Shingo certification for lean. As lean continues to gain more prominence, we fully expect our future annual studies to show increases in lean certification requirements in job postings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It should be noted our firm&amp;#39;s belief is that there is no greater &amp;#39;certification&amp;#39; than true experience and results as a measure of a qualified lean or Six Sigma practitioner,&amp;quot; clarifies Noble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So where does this newfound prominence for lean leave Six Sigma in the broader landscape of corporate continuous improvement? One telling sign from this year&amp;#39;s study is that companies seeking strictly Six Sigma skills with no lean talent requirement accounted for only 25 percent of positions posted in The Avery Point Group&amp;#39;s broad sampling of continuous improvement-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does this spell the beginning of the end for Six Sigma? Not likely, asserts Noble, but Six Sigma may find itself taking a back seat to a broader lean deployment, with Six Sigma applied when and where its heavy emphasis on statistics and variation reduction is best suited.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/7d4zKsfwysY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Analysis: Where lean, Six Sigma projects go wrong</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	What do weight-loss plans and process-improvement programs such as Six Sigma and &amp;quot;lean manufacturing&amp;quot; have in common? They typically start off well, generating excitement and great progress, but all too often fail to have a lasting impact as participants gradually lose motivation and fall back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Robert W. Galvin inducted into Six Sigma Hall of Fame</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	iSixSigma, the leading provider of content for the Six Sigma community through its websites, iSixSigma Magazine and live events, has named former Motorola Corporation president, CEO and chairman Robert &amp;ldquo;Bob&amp;rdquo; W. Galvin as the second inductee in its Six Sigma Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Bob Galvin not only provided the leadership that so influenced the work of Bill Smith, widely regarded as the &amp;#39;Father of Six Sigma&amp;#39;, he refocused the very concepts of quality and global competitiveness for American business,&amp;quot; said Kevin Francella, chief operating officer of iSixSigma&amp;rsquo;s parent company, Ideal Media LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Francella accepted the Hall of Fame award on behalf of Galvin, who was unable to attend the ceremony at the iSixSigma Live! Summit &amp;amp; Awards in Miami Beach, Fla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a career spanning 60 years, Galvin has had a profound influence on the business world as one of the pioneering advocates of continuous process improvement. After Motorola engineer Bill Smith (iSixSigma&amp;rsquo;s inaugural Hall of Fame inductee) convinced him of the benefits of using statistical analysis to improve quality, Galvin officially launched Motorola&amp;rsquo;s Six Sigma program in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Galvin&amp;rsquo;s focus on Six Sigma methods led to innovations in television receivers, dispatch mobile communication, transistors, paging and cellular technology. During Galvin&amp;rsquo;s tenure at Motorola, the company&amp;rsquo;s annual sales grew from a few hundred million dollars to more than $10 billion. In 1988, Motorola became one of the first companies to win the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The son of Paul Galvin, founder of the company that would become Motorola, Robert Galvin joined his father&amp;rsquo;s company in 1940, starting at the bottom in the stock room and working his way up to the executive level. In 1959, Galvin took the reins from his father and held the position of CEO until 1986, staying on as chairman of the board. In 1990, after more than 30 years of service with Motorola, Galvin officially retired and became chairman of Motorola&amp;rsquo;s Executive Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Galvin earned degrees at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, and is currently a member and was the recent chairman of the Board of Trustees of Illinois Institute of Technology. Among his numerous honorary degrees and recognitions, some of his most notable honorifics include the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and an induction into the National Business Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, at age 87, Galvin continues to serve as an officer of Motorola. He is also active in the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a not-for-profit organization he started in 2004 with the goal of applying Six Sigma quality standards to transform the nation&amp;rsquo;s aging and inefficient power grid.

            <title>ASQ report: Quality processes not stifling creativity at U.S. companies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Despite recent news reports to the contrary, quality processes are not stifling creativity at major U.S. corporations. In fact, some highly profitable companies are using unique approaches to strike a balance between efficiency and innovation, according to a new report released recently by the American Society for Quality (ASQ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the report, ASQ profiles two major companies &amp;ndash; DuPont and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble &amp;ndash; well-known industry innovators that have taken steps to fully integrate the creativity-generating functions of R&amp;amp;D and product development with regular process management structures and practices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont uses a variety of Six Sigma methods as well as Stage-Gate, a carefully designed business development process that encourages both consistency and speed. The aim is reduced waste in the design, development and commercialization of new products.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason why Six Sigma should hamper innovation &amp;ndash; if used properly,&amp;quot; said Liz Keim, past president of ASQ who coaches businesses in quality management. &amp;quot;Companies need to understand that quality process tools aren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate for all pieces of a job and should carefully analyze where they can best benefit the bottom line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	P&amp;amp;G maintains that a major driver of its innovation is a unique mix of quality processes that provide structure. Two major examples are Future Works, an organization of multidisciplinary teams that seek innovation opportunities outside of existing business units, and Corporate Innovation Fund, which focuses on high-risk, high-reward ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;More than any other factor, systems are the way we avoid dependence on &amp;lsquo;eureka!&amp;rsquo; approaches to innovation,&amp;quot; said Robert McDonald, P&amp;amp;G chief operating officer. &amp;quot;We select innovation projects, allocate resources and ultimately bring the best innovations to market with highly disciplined processes and systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following are tips for businesses that are working to balance quality processes and innovation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Keep things in perspective: Quality is broader than Six Sigma, and innovation is broader than breakthrough invention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Innovation occurs in social systems. Treat it like a team sport involving real-life interactions of multitudes of real people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Go outside the boundaries of your own organization for innovation insights. Collaborate with customers, suppliers, business partners, and academia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Think of innovation not as a series of unrelated eureka moments, but rather as a process&amp;mdash;a change process that can be managed with familiar change management and quality management methods.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Establish a widespread culture of innovation in your organization. And build innovation-enhancing capabilities throughout a customer-centered value stream.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Challenge the common assumption that innovation is inversely related to structure.&amp;nbsp; Common knowledge will give you only common results no different than what everyone else is doing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Encourage divergent thinking during ideation and convergent thinking during development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Lean/Six Sigma frees up HR to become strategic partner</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Some critics say that many human resources departments and professionals are reactive, process-driven and service-oriented instead of being strategic business partners. Stephen Coco, associate principal of Intellilink, comments, âEveryone wants HR to do more succession planning, organizational design support â in short, âstrategic HR.â However, how do you make yourself more available to be strategic?â&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The workload for HR is already overwhelming in many organizations and it may seem impossible to add any more work. Coco suggests that using some of the concepts from Six Sigma, specifically the âleanâ process management philosophy, can help free up time so you can focus your resources on being more of a strategic business partner in your organization. This back door entrance to strategic HR helps you examine processes and tasks that might be eating up the time of your HR executives and professionals.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The three concepts from the lean process management philosophy that will help you, according to Coco, include:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Focusing on process value,&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;LI&gt;Improving service throughput, and 
&lt;LI&gt;Embracing pull systems. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Using Process Value And Mapping&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Process value and process mapping help you to determine whether the HR function is procedure and process heavy, explains Coco. âAny process that doesnât help keep costs and cycle time down, or doesnât contribute to quality, needs to be reconsidered. Inefficient processes cause waste and can introduce errors into the system.&amp;nbsp;Particularly in HR, where there is much data manipulation and movement of information, there are many âreâsâ â repeats, reworks and rechecks. These âreâsâ add much time and length to the process and donât add a tremendous amount of value?â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Challenging the old way of doing things, such as questioning what may be unnecessary layers of approval, can make a process more efficient, says Coco. âIn HR, weâve seen so many instances where the ceremonial check-offs [checking someone elseâs work and signing off on it] occur because thatâs the way that it has been done before.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If your HR team takes each task and process and reviews the steps involved, the team can decide which steps might be discontinued or streamlined to speed up the processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Improving âThroughputâ&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Improving service throughput (rate of successful message delivery) involves reviewing the systems and staffing for your processes since both affect the end result.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, if you have staff that can handle 50 telephone calls per hour when 100 calls are coming in, would doubling the staff solve your problem? âNot necessarily,â explains Coco.&amp;nbsp;âIt could be that your telephone system cannot handle 100 calls per hour, in which case it wouldnât make sense to add personnel without also upping the system capacity. If you upgrade the system, maybe you can handle the demand by adding only 50 percent more employees.â&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In HR, perhaps too much time is spent on tasks and taking calls because your systems or processes are not up to par, and one or both need an overhaul, he says. Systems quickly become antiquated or obsolete and need to be upgraded or replaced to meet current and future demands.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Introduce âPullâ Systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The last concept that applies well to HR is implementing pull systems â systems that are based on actual customer demand, explains Coco. âLinking process and demand cuts out waste that would otherwise result from overproduction. For service (providers) like HR, the objective is to reduce the overall lead time of providing services by reducing things in progress.â&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, by using an Internet-based, self-service employee portal that allows workers to change personal information; sign up for benefits; and access policies, procedures, forms, communication tools, and wellness information, you could drastically cut down on the need for human interaction within the HR function and give employees better service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The result of reviewing the three lean concepts and examining your processes to determine what needs an overhaul will be the freeing up of HR professionals to serve the organization as business partners. HR can then apply its strengths in the areas of talent management, succession planning, employee and leadership development, and other critical aspects of HR to move the organization toward greater business success and profit margins.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Overcome the barriers to Lean Six Sigma results</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;If youâre like 99 percent of all businesses today, youâre losing 25 to 40 percent of your profit margins to mistakes, rework, errors, omissions, defects and delay. Spending that kind of money to deal with, remedy, resolve and mitigate problems does more than just drain your bottom line; it also adds undo stress to your employees, customers and stakeholders.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Even if youâre among the 1 percent of companies that has perfect employees who never make mistakes and perfect processes that are error-proof, chances are thereâs still some sort of daily crisis management you wish didnât exist. Perhaps you have too many customer complaints, too much firefighting, or too much employee heroism on a daily basis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No matter what your companyâs particular challenge is, consider these questions: âIf you had 25 percent more staff, what new and interesting customer-serving projects would you undertake? What new products or services would you create? What possibilities would you embrace?â Thatâs the power of Lean Six Sigma â having more profit from streamlining your existing processes, which will then free up resources to do the things you simply donât have time to do.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean Six Sigma is a proven methodology for reducing cycle time, defects and delay, and for boosting profits. Itâs a results-oriented, project-focused approach to quality, productivity and profitability. Lean Six Sigma has simple goals, such as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;30 to 60 percent reduction in turnaround time 
&lt;LI&gt;20 to 40 percent reduction in floor space requirements 
&lt;LI&gt;20 to 30 percent improvement in equipment capacity 
&lt;LI&gt;20 to 50 percent improvement in productivity 
&lt;LI&gt;30 to 60 percent reduction in inventory &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These reductions and improvements translate into cost savings, profit growth and competitive advantage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, many companies have barriers that keep them from executing a Lean Six Sigma approach. What follows are some of the common barriers to executing Lean Six Sigma and some suggestions on how to overcome them.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Barrier No. 1: People donât like being measured.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the secrets to getting better, making improvements and increasing customer satisfaction is to realize that your employees donât like being measured. Typically when companies measure their employeesâ work or productivity, they use the information to reprimand employees or make them wrong. While measuring key factors in your company can indeed be useful, you need to use the metrics you uncover to identify how the processes or systems you have in place fail, not how your people fail.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, a call center may measure how long their customer service reps are on the phone with customers. The stated goal is to complete all calls in two minutes or less. As employees strive to stay within the parameters of that measurement, they donât give customers all the information they need, resulting in the customer calling back multiple times. In this case, the number of customer callbacks may be a more important metric than how long employees spend taking care of a customer. After all, what good are short phone calls if you have too many repeat phone calls?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Therefore, look at what youâre measuring and decide if itâs providing useful information. Is what youâre measuring addressing your customersâ real concerns? After this analysis, you might need to totally change what youâre currently measuring. Or, you might find that you are measuring correctly, but you shouldnât use the information to blame your people â blame your process instead, and then change the process.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Barrier No. 2: Having a âmacho manâ complex.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sometimes managers think they know all the right answers. These âmacho menâ (and women) of the organization think theyâre golden. They donât want to be driven in a direction to improve because they think theyâre doing a great job already. They believe theyâre great managers and donât need to change. To them, changing something is an admission that something they did or implemented didnât work. These are the people who truly hold a company back.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To rid this mentality from your managers and employees, you need to let them know that all techniques fail at some point for a variety of reasons â a changing economy, a new industry development, a more diverse workplace, etc.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Explain that all companies need new processes, approaches and techniques to find the hidden goldmine in the company. Help them realize that the goldmine is already there in the business â they just canât see it the way theyâve always been looking at it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Barrier No. 3: Getting achievers and problem-solvers to work together.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You can group all of your employees into one of two categories: Achievers or Problem-Solvers. Hereâs the difference: If you ask people whatâs important to them about their job, they will say one of two things: &lt;BR&gt;1) Itâs about what I can do, achieve or accomplish (the Achievers), or &lt;BR&gt;2) Itâs about avoiding difficulty, solving problems and avoiding mistakes (the Problem-Solvers).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Achievers are not cut out for finding and fixing problems. Their focus is to sell more products or services and to grow the business. Problem-Solvers, on the other hand, are great at fixing problems, but they donât have a visionary mind-set. Without a problem to solve, they lack direction. As a result, in many companies thereâs conflict between the two mind-sets.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Therefore, you need to encourage the Achievers to go to the Problem-Solvers to help reach goals. Likewise, you need to encourage the Problem-Solvers to look to the Achievers for direction (although the Problem-Solvers will be the ones who ultimately solve the problem).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To identify the Achievers and Problem-Solvers in your company, ask people two simple questions: &lt;BR&gt;1) Whatâs important to you about your work? And,&lt;BR&gt;2) Why is that important? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs suppose you ask everyone the first question and they all answer that serving the customer is important. When you ask them why thatâs important, Achievers will give answers like, âWe get more business,â âWe get better raises,â and âWe gain a greater market share.â To them, itâs all about achieving and what they get. Problem-Solvers will give answers like, âWe avoid having irate customers on the phone,â âWe donât have as many warranty claims,â and âWe donât have to do rework.â To them, itâs all about avoiding pain. Once you know which category everyone fits into, you can bridge the gap between the two mindsets so everyone works together efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lean Six Sigma for Your Future&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally, with all the barriers removed, be sure to give your employees permission to make things better. While the leadership team should ultimately pick the things that need to be improved, let your employees know that they have permission to change how those aspects of the business work. Give each employee ample face time to help ensure that they come up with good solutions everyone can live with. Nine times out of 10, their suggestions will amaze you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, many of todayâs companies are addicted to fire-fighting and crisis management. As such, they tend to worship the âheroâ who is always saving the day. But when you overcome these common barriers and effectively execute Lean Six Sigma in your company, you donât have fires anymore. Your business just runs the way it should. Itâs like a village where everyone contributes to the villageâs overall well-being.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When you make these changes happen in your business, youâll experience a reduction in defects, increased quality, financial savings, and a predictable and manageable workload. At that point, youâll be able to reclaim all those lost profits and grow your company to new heights of success.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Using DFM, lean and Six Sigma effectively</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Some have the perception that tools such as Design for Manufacturability, lean and Six Sigma are mutually exclusive. Others think that they are all synonymous buzzwords. The truth, in fact, is that each one is unique, and together they can make for a very powerful combination. This article will give you a practical example of the application of these tools in combination.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Letâs take an equipment manufacturer, XYZ. XYZ is developing a new, revolutionary product that it will house in a new factory. The product is completing the research and development stage of XYZâs New Product Introduction process. The design team is at the point at which they must develop design concepts. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is at this stage that they apply Design for Manufacturability to their process. They begin with a design concept that represents a design that they would normally develop. (This can usually be created rather quickly and based upon a previous design.) Then, a team takes over. Using a system for evaluating this design, the team creates a baseline process for assembling this product with the initial design. The baseline gives them the number of steps and an estimate of the time to assemble. The team then brainstorms ideas to apply to the design that would reduce the design complexity (number of manufacturing steps). The ideas are then evaluated and categorized; the team develops design concepts. The team then develops an action plan in which individuals from the team are to investigate and implement the design concepts. Product âshould costsâ are developed based on the designs. They will likely show 30 percent to 40 percent reductions in overall product cost. XYZ is now confident that they have a low-cost manufacturing option that will give them the best chance for error-free manufacturing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At this stage, XYZ decides to apply lean thinking to their factory. Using the manufacturing process from the DFM workshop as a baseline, they use kaizen blitz events to develop cells and an overall factory flow. They begin with a takt time based on the marketing forecast and a âfive days per week, three shifts per dayâ operation. Cells and workstations are designed. The team develops plans for 5-S and maintenance, pull system, layout, inventory management, setup and lot size, etc. XYZ now has plans for a lean factory, which become inputs to the factory design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;XYZ is ready to apply the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology. Using the manufacturing processes designed, Six Sigma blackbelts lead teams to define performance metrics based on critical-to-quality characteristics. The CTQs were defined by the design team in conjunction with XYZâs customers. They develop methods for measurement at this point. Using FMEA (failure modes and effects analysis), they develop a control plan. When manufacturing actually begins, they apply their control plan. It is now that they can begin analysis of actual production data and adjust their control plans and measurement methods accordingly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above example is simply one way to apply Six Sigma, lean and Design for Manufacturability. It is certainly not the only way to do this; in reality, there would often be more iterations of each methodology with more overlap. My hope is that this article enhances your understanding of the tools and methodologies and allows you to develop your own plans for implementing each of them as appropriate for your organization.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;About the author:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Darren Dolcemascolo is an internationally recognized lecturer, author and consultant.

            <title>General Dynamics relies on Lean/Six Sigma at Maine gun facility</title>
            <description>General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products is investing in production equipment and accelerating its enterprise-wide focus on Lean/Six Sigma-based process improvements at its Saco, Maine, gun manufacturing facility to increase the plantâs capacity. The site serves as General Dynamicsâ core production site for single- and multi-barrel aircraft and crew-served weapon systems. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Products manufactured in Saco include the MK19 and MK47 40-millimeter grenade weapon systems, high-speed multi-barrel Gatling guns and M2 50-caliber machine guns. General Dynamicsâ Gatling gun systems are onboard every U.S. fighter aircraft, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the company has manufactured more than 30,000 MK19 gun systems. The M2 machine gun has been in production at Saco since 1979. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;According to Mike OâBrien, vice president/general manager of gun systems for General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products, âAs we anticipate the needs of our Department of Defense customers, we understand that our ability to remain responsive and flexible in a very dynamic marketplace is absolutely critical. The first phase of our initiative to prepare our Saco site for future growth involves capital investments of more than $5 million in equipment. When coupled with our Lean/Six Sigma approach to our production process, this will allow us to net additional efficiencies. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;âIn the first phase, our focus will be on providing greater capacity to support our MK19 and M2 production lines. We have recently hired more than 60 production employees and we intend to hire approximately 30 more to ensure capacity for future technologies such as our Advanced Crew Served Weapon Systems. To complement this investment, General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products is also committed to advanced technical training for the newly hired and existing workforce.â&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products was recently awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command (TACOM) to produce M2HB machine guns, valued at up to $36.6 million through 2009. Production work will be performed at the Saco site, and deliveries are expected to begin in April 2008. The guns will be used on ground vehicles by the U.S. Army, Army Reserve, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy, as well as several foreign military customers. The program will be managed out of General Dynamics Armament and Technical Productsâ Burlington, Vt., facility.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;âThe M2HB 12.7-millimeter (caliber .50) machine gun fires at a rate of more than 450 rounds per minute and has a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards. The machine gunâs high level of lethality, reliability and versatility has made it the world standard in its class and can give warfighters a critical advantage,â said OâBrien.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products, located in Charlotte, N.C., a business unit of General Dynamics, provides a broad range of system solutions for military and commercial applications. The company designs, develops and produces high-performance armament systems; a full range of advanced composite-based products; biological and chemical detection systems; and mobile shelter systems.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Va., employs approximately 83,500 people worldwide and reported 2007 revenues of $27.2 billion. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/4lnx2jGtiAg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Process simulation improves success of Six Sigma projects</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;One of the greatest complaints we hear from senior managers is âprojects are successfully completed, but Iâm not seeing a significant change to the bottom line.â Thatâs because in the Define stage of DMAIC (Define- Measure- Analyze- Improve- Control), Six Sigma experts donât have enough information to quantify the benefits. They are predicting a bottom-line financial benefit without truly understanding how the process behaves, let alone how it would behave after the change. Without seeing the big picture, you may complete a successful Six Sigma project and see no impact in dollars for your organization. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is a better way. With Process Modeling, you create a simple simulated model of the process. You will visually see which projects will affect the total output and which will sub-optimize the system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Key advantages of integrating Six Sigma phases (DMAIC) with Process Modeling are provided below:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overall interdependencies in processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The standard Six Sigma toolbox has no way of showing the interdependencies between one area of the process and another. In complex change initiatives where there are interdependencies between processes, when incidents happen that cause delays, bottlenecks, variability etc., if you canât show the interdependencies, understanding the system and resolving issues is very difficult. If you canât understand the system and pinpoint the waste and bottlenecks, changing the system could be risky and typically does not provide the desired results. A simulated model shows those interdependencies, which allows you to uncover changes that will affect the overall system. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk-free experimentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is proven that real-time experiments are costly and can have an enormous negative impact on the system. If you are experimenting with a simulated model of the system, the only cost is setting up the experiment and reviewing the results. There are no negative impacts to system output or to the morale of the workforce in trying new process experiments. You can change the parameters, run various scenarios and, if the desired outcome is not achieved, you can pinpoint the root causes, all the while gathering more information about system behavior â without any disruption to the real system. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced experimentation time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can run hundreds of experiments a day rather than hundreds of days per experiment. Many processes have a cycle time of weeks or even months. Running enough replications of an experiment to validate the results can be overwhelming. With a simulated model, you can run as many computer simulations as you want and develop plans based upon the review of results. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impact of change on the existing process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Processes that achieve the goal of Six Sigma (or a high sigma level) fall out of spec if the volumes change. For example, a 50 percent change to incoming calls to a call center may cripple a customer-oriented sales process. Planning for change in your system by using a simulated model to understand the effects of volume change, product stream substitution, staffing policy or other changes can significantly reduce project risks and the associated costs. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Combining Design for Manufacturability, lean and Six Sigma</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Some have the perception that tools such as Design for Manufacturability, lean and Six Sigma are mutually exclusive. Others think that they are all synonymous buzzwords. The truth, in fact, is that each one is unique, and together they can make for a very powerful combination. This article will give you a practical example of the application of these tools in combination. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs take an equipment manufacturer, XYZ. This company is developing a new, revolutionary product that it will house in a new factory. The product is completing the research and development stage of XYZâs New Product Introduction process. The design team is at the point at which they must develop design concepts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is at this stage that they apply Design for Manufacturability to their process. They begin with a design concept that represents a design that they would normally develop. (This can usually be created rather quickly and based upon a previous design.) Then, a team takes over. Using a system for evaluating this design, the team creates a baseline process for assembling this product with the initial design. The baseline gives them the number of steps and an estimate of the time to assemble. The team then brainstorms ideas to apply to the design that would reduce the design complexity (number of manufacturing steps). The ideas are then evaluated and categorized; the team develops design concepts. The team then develops an action plan in which individuals from the team are to investigate and implement the design concepts. Product âshould-costsâ are developed based on the designs. They will likely show 30 to 40 percent reductions in overall product cost. XYZ is now confident that they have a low-cost manufacturing option that will give them the best chance for error-free manufacturing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At this stage, XYZ decides to apply lean thinking to their factory. Using the manufacturing process from the DFM workshop as a baseline, they use kaizen blitz events to develop cells and an overall factory flow. They begin with a takt time based on the marketing forecast and a five-days-per-week, three-shifts-per-day operation. Cells and workstations are designed. The team develops plans for 5-S and maintenance, pull system, layout, inventory management, setup and lot size, etc. XYZ now has plans for a lean factory, which become inputs to the factory design. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;XYZ is ready to apply the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology. Using the manufacturing processes designed, Six Sigma black belts lead teams to define performance metrics based on critical-to-quality characteristics. The CTQs were defined by the design team in conjunction with XYZâs customers. They develop methods for measurement at this point. Using FMEA (failure modes and effects analysis), they develop a control plan. When manufacturing actually begins, they apply their control plan. It is now that they can begin analysis of actual production data and adjust their control plans and measurement methods accordingly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The above is simply one way to apply Six Sigma, lean and design for manufacturability. It is certainly not the only way to do this; in reality, there would often be more iterations of each methodology with more overlap. My hope is that this article enhances your understanding of the tools and methodologies and allows you to develop your own plans for implementing each of them as appropriate for your organization. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Lean/Six Sigma: The quest for efficiency in manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Management slogans often boil down to little more than platitudes in slick consultancy packaging. But some corporate lingo stands for more than a passing fad. âLean manufacturingâ, a shorthand for a commitment to eliminating waste, simplifying procedures and speeding up production, is one such concept. Six Sigma, the quality-assurance principles that are often paired with lean efforts, is another. The principles and techniques that the two terms encompass have been shown to deliver impressive bottom-line results in industrial manufacturing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To be sure, the taint of best-seller management slogans lingers over lean and Six Sigma, leading many executives to dismiss the terms as mere jargon or consultancy buzzwords. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe western hemisphere is full of program-of-the-month syndrome,â says Anand Sharma, president and CEO of TBM Consulting Group, a U.S. firm that helps companies adopt lean and Six Sigma principles. âItâs more fashionable today to talk about âleanâ than to do it.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But manufacturers that have gone beyond words to deeds and embraced lean and Six Sigma report tangible, sustained gains. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThis is not a program,â says Denny Van Zanten, manufacturing vice president at Pella, a major American window and door maker that first adopted lean methods 10 years ago and is still reaping the returns. âLean is a part of Pellaâs culture.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adds Stephen Printz, Pellaâs chief information officer: âHere, lean is a way of life.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Emerson Electric is another proponent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLean is clearly a significant strategy for us,â says Steve Hamby, Emersonâs vice president of IT shared services. âItâs a concept, a strategy and a philosophy. This thing is real.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Learning lean lessons &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the heart of lean manufacturing is a focus on the reduction of inventory and lead times. Production is driven by real customer orders, rather than forecasts that anticipate market demand. This means that demand âpullsâ a product through production, rather than management forecasts âpushingâ it onto the shop floor. Six Sigma, by contrast, is oriented to improving product quality and consistency by reducing the flaws that occur in manufacturing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For many manufacturers, linking lean with Six Sigma is a perfect marriage, providing the tools needed to meet real demand with high-quality products in the shortest time possible. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThey are really complementary things,â says Bob Parker, research vice president at Bostonâs AMR Research. âThe whole is greater than the sum of the parts.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean and Six Sigma have gained a following where other management cures have failed, largely owing to word of mouth and the demonstration effect of industry success stories. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIt starts with a CEO waking up in a cold sweat,â says Parker. âMaybe they know someone at GE and theyâve seen the amazing results.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Internal pilot programs are also persuasive. A few divisions of U.S. manufacturer Emerson Electric began applying lean principles five or six years ago. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFollowing that, as senior management saw different results at different locations, they began to raise leanâs visibilityâ within Emerson, says Chris Stephen, director of systems planning and e-business development. âThey appointed a vice president at the corporate level with full-time responsibility to put together several plans and measurable results for lean.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The impulse to adopt lean methods can also come from business partners. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After years of working with lean and Six Sigma principles, many companies realize that, to continue improving, they need to get suppliers and even customers involved â such as happened with Toyota. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âCompanies get their suppliers into Six Sigma,â says Georg Reindl, Oracleâs European director of high-technology industry business. In Europeâs largest countries, he says, manufacturers âare all working in this direction and using lean.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once companies have adopted lean and Six Sigma principles, some benefits come quickly, others more slowly. But the beauty of lean manufacturing is its focus on continuous improvement, and, thus, on a steady flow of benefits. The most advanced users of the two techniques expand the concept well beyond the manufacturing process, and apply them to every corporate activity, even communications and processes involving suppliers. Here the focus is on a âlean enterpriseâ rather than simply on âlean manufacturing.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Among the chief benefits are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost efficiency: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Many companies initially look to lean methods as a means to reduce manufacturing costs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Indeed, an Economist Intelligence Unit survey of 83 manufacturing executives showed that 90 percent of respondents â the largest group â saw reduced costs as a goal of lean/Six Sigma programs (see Table 1). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But lean veterans warn that focusing solely on costs is shortsighted. The savings come, to be sure, but an exclusive focus on cost reduction can leave a manufacturer with unsustainable improvements. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âCompanies that take a narrow approach to lean get some cost improvements,â says AMRâs &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Parker, noting that some companies use lean as an alibi for layoffs or to squeeze lower prices out of suppliers. âBut the results are not sustainable,â he warns. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A healthier approach is to treat lean as a stimulus to growth. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe key to Pellaâs success is our people,â says Van Zanten, noting that Pellaâs headcount has grown significantly since embracing lean. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rather than laying off factory staff as processes have become more efficient, the firm has expanded its product line to include doors. In fact, companies that have adopted the lean approach often find that their market share increases because quality and lead-time improvements give them powerful competitive advantages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inventory reduction: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Carrying inventory costs a company in warehouse space, constrained capital and potential handling damage. Excessive inventory also slows down the manufacturing process and becomes a drag on lead times while reducing needed agility. Companies making smaller product batches are also more likely to spot and easily repair defects without disrupting production cycles. At Pella, as soon as the window maker began lean manufacturing in 1993, manufacturing costs dropped, inventory shrunk and there was more available space on the shop floor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe had fantastic results,â remembers Van Zanten, adding, âYou can see the strong upward trend in our sales growth.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shorter cycle times: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Through tireless elimination of waste in production, dedicated lean practitioners such as Emerson, Pella, Toyota and controls and tools maker Danaher are able to manufacture products more quickly. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe shorter cycle times give you a lot more flexibilityâ to respond to market shifts, explains Parker. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Customer orders can enter the manufacturing process sooner, without having to wait for a planned lot, and materials progress through the production process faster, without waiting in lengthy queues at each workstation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Greater flexibility: &lt;/STRONG&gt;That flexibility is key in many industries today â from home appliances to large industrial equipment â where product life cycles are shrinking. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âGlobal companies need to become real-time enterprises,â notes Oracleâs Mr. Reindl. âIf they donât have lean processes in place, they wonât be able to meet market demands.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enhanced agility â the ability to respond almost immediately to customer demands â is a key benefit of a lean approach. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Challenges to lean efforts &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Programs that deliver continuous improvement also require continuous effort, however, and companies should shed any illusion that reaping the benefits of lean/Six Sigma is easy. As with all change, achieving a transformation to lean manufacturing takes hard work, inspired leadership and indefatigable dedication. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A first challenge is to move beyond slogans to deeds, and actually implement lean principles. Only half the companies that say they are adopting lean and Six Sigma principles are actually doing so, estimates Sharma. A key test, he says, is to check the firmâs inventory turns. If a manufacturer turns its inventory only six times a year, or once every two months, the firm can hardly be called lean. Companies committed to lean methods are more likely to have an inventory turn of 10 or higher. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âTo be responsive, you have to lower lead times,â Sharma adds. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Corporate inertia is another obstacle, particularly where shop-floor personnel cling to traditional notions learned early in their careers. Itâs hard, for example, for the operator of an expensive machine to discard the notion that idle machinery loses money. After decades of getting the most production possible out of all machinery, workers have a hard time understanding how much a company loses when it produces products for which there is no demand. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are conceptual challenges for management as well. Managers need to understand that the old measures of success â efficiency and utilization â have been supplanted by agility, increased inventory turns and reduced cycle times, along with top quality. The measures needed to effect this change in mind-set can upset many longstanding processes, including performance reviews and pay rates, and raise strong emotions. Indeed, half of the respondents to the Economist Intelligence Unit survey identified company culture as a key challenge for lean/Six Sigma, and 45 percent cited a lack of resources for staff training as a stumbling block. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The upheaval inherent in Lean/Six Sigma programs means that the engagement of senior management is required for successful implementation. Adequate resources must be allocated &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;to train employees, and resolve is also necessary to push through reorganization in production processes and inventory management. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âA lot of companies want to go down the lean path but they waver on the senior team commitment,â says Pellaâs Printz. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Using technology to get lean &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A final challenge comes in employing technology to create a rapid and efficient flow of information between all the parties in a supply chain. Such a seamless information flow is essential to reaping the benefits of lean/Six Sigma. IT allows lean manufacturers to stay in sync with suppliers, says Parker, while helping to tackle the unwieldy challenges of modeling, calibrating, operating and improving manufacturing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âTechnology can look forward to tell you how to smooth production and optimize customer service levels,â says Sharma. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;IT can also help with âwhat-ifsâ in, for example, reconfiguring a factory floor or determining the optimal location for inventory. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Especially at large organizations, where so many departments, plants and subsidiaries need to operate together to achieve a common goal, technology can help to keep everyone moving in step with, for example, flow scheduling. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âInformation can help quicken and sustain the adoption of lean,â says Manish Modi, Oracleâs senior director of manufacturing applications development. âTechnology truly helps you move to a make-to-demand model.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A good technology backbone system acts as a repository for customer and production data and provides the key performance indicators that are used to measure success in both lean and Six Sigma initiatives. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Corporate business systems need to be flexible enough to allow the data flow to map closely to business processes; otherwise, errors and inefficiencies can creep in. Flexibility is also key to the âcontrolled experiment,â a core lean/Six Sigma principle that calls for testing a variety of possible outcomes to determine an optimal solution. If information cannot be captured accurately for such scenarios, the results may be distorted or completely useless. Advanced technology systems now include multiple business process flows that enable companies to run such tests. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These âbest practiceâ business flows can inspire other companies to jumpstart their own process mapping. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For all the pluses, companies using technology to achieve Lean/Six Sigma goals need to heed two guidelines: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;First, an emphasis on simplicity means that the adoption of lean methods does not necessarily entail higher IT spending. Emersonâs IT Shared Services department has been able, in fact, to use lean methods to reduce costly or unnecessary IT use. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean manufacturing aims to reduce transactions to a minimum, so it can eliminate needless transactions that raise reporting and labor costs â without adding value. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Second, itâs crucial that business needs, rather than technology, determine the actual map of information flow. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âYou have physically to change your process first and then bring in the technology to help,â says Sharma. âYou cannot depend on technology alone. Using technology as a panacea gets a lot of companies into trouble.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Pella âs Van Zanten concurs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âSimplify the process first,â he recommends, âand then technology is a beautiful thing.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SIDEBARS &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The origins of âleanâ &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLeanâ was a Japanese invention, inspired by a plant tour of Ford Motors in the 1950s. After watching an American assembly plant build cars in a more efficient way than they used at home, two Japanese executives developed the Toyota Production System (TPS). This approach propelled Toyota from a modest domestic firm to a global car giant. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Indeed, while much of the car industry has suffered from a lackluster economy, Toyota saw its net income increase 23.2 percent in the half year to September 2003 from the same period the previous year â on a revenue increase of 8 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âToday, even when everyone else is struggling, Toyota continues to make money,â says Anand Sharma. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once TPS was well established within Toyota, the firm recognized that many potential gains would go unrealized if its partners werenât also involved. So in the 1970s, Yoshiki Iwata and other lean pioneers from Toyota created Shingijutsu, a consulting company with the mission of bringing the TPS gospel to outside firms. As early as 1989, Shingijutsu worked with Danaherâs Jacobs Equipment Company brake plant and helped to establish it as the first facility in the U.S. to go lean. TPS eventually came to widespread notice in the US with the 1992 opening of a Toyota Supplier Support Center (TSSC) in the U.S. state of Kentucky. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the years since TPS was developed, lean principles have expanded beyond Japanese car making to other industries and around the globe. In Asia, most multinationals are already involved in lean programs, and âthere is a big uptake among indigenousâ local manufacturers as well, says Brad Perkins, a senior director in discrete manufacturing industries at Oracle in Singapore. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the U.S., carmakers have a lead, but other industries are waking up to the opportunity, says Manish Modi, Oracleâs senior director of manufacturing applications development. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;U.S. manufacturing companies that had been firmly focused on other techniques such as just-in-time manufacturing were quick to adopt and rapidly refine lean manufacturing. Industry segments where margins are very thin, such as automotive and industrials, lead the way. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Six Sigma is often paired with Lean principles in manufacturing efforts to ensure flawless product quality and repeatable execution. It originated in the U.S. in 1986, when Bill Smith, a senior engineer and scientist at Motorola, devised a standardized way to count defects. The name is inspired by the Greek letter sigma, used to denote standard deviations in statistics. Six Sigma programs, employed by firms as diverse as GE, Allied Signal and Tyco, use detailed data analysis to improve all business processes, with the aim of achieving a defect rate no higher than 3.4 per million. Coupling lean and Six Sigma helps deliver value to customers in a repeatable manner. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The lingo of lean &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A lot of lean vocabulary is derived from the Japanese language. You donât need to use these &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;words to adopt lean methods, but knowing them can be helpful when working with consultants and partners. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Jidoka &lt;/STRONG&gt;is a means of stopping production when flaws are detected. Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota, fathered the notion when he invented an automatic loom in the early 1900s. The loom stopped when any thread broke, letting a single operator oversee production on many looms at the same time. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Kanban &lt;/STRONG&gt;is a card, sign or signal that triggers replenishment of a material when it is required to continue the production process. Kanban control ensures that parts are not made except in response to demand. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Kaizen &lt;/STRONG&gt;means continuous improvement, or changing for the better. âKaiâ means âto changeâ and âzenâ means âfor the good.â So during a âKaizen event,â a team scrutinizes a manufacturerâs operations and then makes suggestions on how to improve them. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Poka-Yoke &lt;/STRONG&gt;refers to a mistake-proofing procedure to prevent defects during ordertaking or manufacturing. It comes from âpoka,â meaning âerrors,â and âyoke,â the verb âto avoid.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;seven wastes &lt;/STRONG&gt;are the most common wastes found in physical production, catalogued by lean pioneer Taiichi Ohno, namely, overproduction ahead of demand, waiting for the next processing step, unnecessary transport of materials, overprocessing of parts due to poor tool and product design, keeping inventories of more than the absolute minimum, unnecessary movement by employees during work and production of defective parts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Takt&lt;/STRONG&gt; , derived from the German âder Takt,â meaning âbeatâ or âpulse,â is the rate of customer demand. A lean manufacturerâs goal is to be right on the takt time. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ten tenets of lean manufacturing &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If your company wants to get lean, whatâs the best way to start? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Secure backing from the top &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Before doing anything, get firm support from your companyâs decision-makers. âIf you are not Lean and want to get started, the top management team has to understand what theyâre getting into,â says TBMâs Sharma. Adds Emersonâs Hamby: âYou need a top-down approach, rather than a grass-roots effort.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Roll up your shirtsleeves &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean can produce dramatic improvements. But no one said it would be easy. âMany people are looking for a quick answer to a difficult problem,â says Sharma. âThey donât hear that theyâll have to do some work first.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Communicate and educate &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe spend a lot of time communicating before, during and at the end [of a Kaizan event, when a team scrutinizes operations and then makes suggestions for improvements] to make sure everyone understands,â says Pellaâs Van Zanten. âCommunication is key. When we have a success, we really communicate it.â Adds Emersonâs Stephen: âYou need a lot of education. Build awareness, train people and get some champions.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Donât skimp on training &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean manufacturing goes against the grain of many manufacturing traditions. âLeave enough time to change the thinking within the company,â advises Parker. âTest and make sure there is a level of understanding. If [the staff doesnât] get it on the first round of training, do another round. Make sure you have the culture turned around before going forward.â Remember that Lean changes more than just production processes; it can affect everything from personnel performance measures to how salespeople promise delivery dates to customers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Apply suitable metrics &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Re-jig how you measure success and failure. âUnder the old cost-accounting system, your score was good if your most expensive machine was running 24/7,â notes Parker. Lean canât succeed, he says, âif you donât change the way people keep score.â The traditional measures of success â efficiency and utilization â need to be replaced with agility, lead time, inventory turns and quality across the board. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Help your partners &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIf you donât extend Lean beyond your four walls, you will have dissatisfied suppliers,â warns Oracleâs Modi. âCompanies that are far reaching have educated their suppliers on lean.â In fact, the most successful lean companies involve their suppliers in product design in order to improve quality and simplify manufacturing. And they work together to improve communication methods and shorten lead times throughout the supply chain. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Think big &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a company shortens its production cycles, manufacturing experiments can be quick and painless. So an attempt to improve things can hold tremendous potential, and can be made without serious consequences â even if it fails. âWhen in doubt, be bold,â advises Van Zanten. âWe set aggressive goals. You canât just make minor tweaks.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Shift the goalposts &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âDonât declare victory too soon,â recommends Sharma. Pellaâs Van Zanten likes to remember how after a year of lean efforts, the CIO asked him for a progress report. âAbout 25 percent,â Van Zanten estimated. A year later, the CIO asked the same question, yet this time the response was 10 percent. The anecdote shows that lean manufacturing is like getting a new pair of glasses that help you continually to see new ways in which to reduce waste and improve business. âThe more you do, the more opportunities there are that become visible,â adds Pellaâs Printz. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Get the faith &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âContinuous improvement (kaizen) is our way of life,â says industrial conglomerate Danaher, which has been a lean manufacturer since the 1980s. Only with focus and dedication can Lean/Six Sigma bring benefits to your company. âWe are finding that customers who have adopted lean as a religion are seeing bigger benefits,â says Modi. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Prepare for the long haul &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean doesnât end after you reach your first set of goals, and itâs not a finite project with a beginning and end date. Rather itâs a way of business life that executives need to pursue continuously. âThereâs a vigilance that has to be maintained from the executive suite,â says Parker. âYouâre always looking for a better way,â adds Robert Azavedo, Oracleâs director of discrete manufacturing industries in Europe. âThe journey never ends.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Lean Six Sigma improves Humvee repairs</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A team from the U.S. Armyâs 21st Theater Support Command in Kaiserslautern, Germany, is applying some focused fire to workplace inefficiency. And now, they're seeing immediate results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A group of Lean Six Sigma practitioners called green and black belts aimed to improve output for the center, which is a new Humvee engine rebuilding line for U.S. forces in Europe during a weeklong Rapid Improvement Event (RIE) held December 11-15, 2006 on Rhein Ordnance Barracks. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We are the first to host an RIE in Europe ... because we want to see our process efficient," said Klaus Rupp, the facility maintenance manager. "The RIE is making this improvement possible in a very short time."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An RIE is a project designed to quickly identify inefficiencies and recommend immediate corrective action by using LSS, a process improvement methodology used in industry and being adopted by the military.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every employee is involved and encouraged to offer criticism of current work processes and to suggest possible solutions to problems they've identified, said Klaus Kastrup, an LSS specialist from the George Group, a consulting firm assisting U.S. Army, Europe with this and other such projects. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Lean Six Sigma is about people," Kastrup said. "If something doesn't work, they're going to know better because they see it daily."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The team spent the first days of the RIE observing mechanics at work and identifying specific areas in need of streamlining. Organizing parts and tools was one of the obvious improvements immediately incorporated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"We must think about how much time the mechanic takes to find a tool or find a part," Kastrup said. "If he takes too long because we don't have the part where he needs it, that's waste. We are here to fix that."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other improvements the team recommended: co-locating the engine disassembly and parts-cleaning centers; and improving communication between mechanics and supervisors by using a status-tracking board.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rupp believes the changes will "improve life for everyone."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"It gives ownership of the process to the mechanics, improvements come from their ideas," he said, adding that it will also result in returning high-quality vehicles to field units.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Meredith Weber, 21st TSC LSS manager, said the USAREUR-funded event was ideal for improving the engine rebuilding line and could also be useful in improving any process throughout the command.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"An RIE is designed to yield maximum results in a minimal amount of time," she said. "It's fast-paced and can be stressful, but it's useful in identifying and correcting inefficiencies in any process, from manufacturing to office work. There's always something that can be improved, and this is a great tool to make that happen."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/six_sigma/~4/NM-La6s7Qvo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Theory of Constraints: How does it fit with lean and Six Sigma?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Numerous process improvement methodologies have been proposed in recent years. Three of the most prominent are Six Sigma, lean and the Theory of Constraints (TOC). How can you determine which methodology is the right one for your organization? While the ultimate goal of all three is to increase profit, their more immediate goals to accomplish this vary: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Six Sigma - consistently meet customer expectations &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean - add value for the customer &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;TOC - increase throughput &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What are some additional characteristics, differences and similarities of these approaches? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Six Sigma &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Six Sigma is a data-driven approach that focuses on reducing variation in order to solve both process and business problems. It applies a very structured and rigid methodology to meet customer specifications and assumes that variations are the cause of defects that impact customers negatively. Six Sigma also assumes the entire process to which it is applied will be improved by implementing variation reductions for multiple elements. The methodology encompasses five steps: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define&lt;/STRONG&gt; â Determine, who are the customers, what are their problems, and what are the process elements and output conditions? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Measure&lt;/STRONG&gt; â Categorize key characteristics, verify measurement systems, collect data &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analyze&lt;/STRONG&gt; â Convert data into information, identify most important causes of problems &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve&lt;/STRONG&gt; â Develop solutions to the problem, implement changes, evaluate results through measurements &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Control&lt;/STRONG&gt; â If performance is now as desired and predictable, put it under ongoing control to ensure consistency &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is also hoped that the focus on reduction in variation can produce other secondary effects, such as quality improvement, elimination of superfluous elements and a decrease in errors. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lean &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lean thinking, or lean manufacturing, as it is sometimes called, focuses on the removal of waste, defined as anything that is not necessary to the production of the good or service and does not add value to the final customer. There is an emphasis on the flow of processes. Some of the assumptions underlying the methodology include that waste is the main limitation on profitability and that many small, rapid improvements are more beneficial than analytical study. The approach consists of five steps: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Identify features that create value (either for the ultimate customer or a subsequent process) 
&lt;LI&gt;Identify the value stream, i.e., the sequence of activities which contribute to the value for the customer; determine whether activities which do not contribute value are, nonetheless, necessary 
&lt;LI&gt;Make the activities flow with minimal interruption; common flow inhibitors are queues, batch processing and transportation 
&lt;LI&gt;Allow the customer to pull product or service through the process; provide it only when the customer needs it 
&lt;LI&gt;Perfect the process; continually attempt to remove non-value activity, improve flow and meet customer needs &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As with Six Sigma, it is hoped that leanâs focus on eradicating waste and enhancing flow will have some secondary effects, including quality improvement, process acceleration, and reduction of constraints and obsolescence. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Theory of Constraints &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Theory of Constraints (TOC) logic-driven approach focuses on system improvement. It views the system as a chain of interdependent links that work together toward the primary goal of transforming inputs into sold outputs, thereby increasing throughput (the rate at which the organization generates goal units â usually dollars). The performance of the entire system is limited by the weakest link, or the constraint. All improvement efforts should be aimed at this constraint through the use of five focusing steps: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Identify the constraint&lt;/STRONG&gt; â can be a physical process or a policy &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exploit the constraint&lt;/STRONG&gt; â decide how to do everything possible to utilize the constraint to its maximum capability &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Subordinate to the above decision&lt;/STRONG&gt; â all other activities should be adjusted to support and defer to the constraint, to insure it operates at peak effectiveness &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Elevate the constraint&lt;/STRONG&gt; â if system performance is still not satisfactory, consider investments to improve or eliminate the constraint &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Repeat the cycle&lt;/STRONG&gt; â once the previous constraint is broken, go back to Step 1 and identify the new constraint; before starting again, be sure that old habits, policies and rules are re-evaluated considering the changed environment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Assumptions include that the speed and volume at which products or services travel through the system are primary determinants of success, and, therefore, removing the constraint will improve profitability. Secondary effects include protective inventories, quality improvement, reduced variation, and a positive impact on flow and, therefore, throughput. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Choosing the right methodology &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How can you determine which methodology is the right one for your organization? One of the main distinctions between TOC and the other two methodologies is TOCâs extensive focus on the systemâs constraint, while the other two approaches are not targeted in this manner. While it may appear attractive on the surface to make improvements anywhere they can be made, economic reality is that resources are limited. Hence, TOC dictates that you want the most improvement possible for the least investment. Efforts to improve all of your organizations individual processes at the same time could actually have a detrimental effect by hindering your ability to meet your customerâs needs and provide your product or service when itâs needed at the lowest cost. Another consideration is that TOCâs focus on one specific constraint at a time requires only a relatively localized effort. Therefore, extensive data analysis and involvement of the entire work force is not critical to success as they are with Six Sigma and lean. Significant results can be expected with TOC after just three months of effort. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you are already utilizing one of these approaches, there are ways in which the methodologies can complement each other, especially with regard to exploiting a constraint identified through a TOC effort. Six Sigma can be a tool for getting more throughput out of a constraint, and lean thinking can help eliminate any waste associated with it. They might also be used to drive out disruptive variation or reduce waste associated with non-constraint processes that interfere with the constraint, as well as to make sure the constraint is never starved or fed inferior inputs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some precautions should be taken, though. First, take care not to drive out waste to such an extent that the protective capacity vital to buffering the constraint is also eliminated. Second, be aware of the differences among the methodologies with regard to balanced systems. While lean and Six Sigma will tend toward balance throughout the system, TOC relies upon an imbalance in the form of focus upon the current constraint. Although the flow throughout the system should be balanced, the capacity should not â only the constraint will continually operate at maximum capacity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In conclusion, be sure not to waste time and resources on strengthening system elements that are already strong. Focus your efforts where they will produce the best return. TOC can guide you through the process of identifying and breaking your organizationâs constraints, increasing your throughput and realizing the dramatic benefit to your bottom line. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ideaâs method of success &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Assess the current situation, immediate threats, longer-term needs, effort required and impact of moving from a âpushâ to a âpullâ system 
&lt;LI&gt;Gain top management buy-in to the assessment and approach 
&lt;LI&gt;Build knowledge and understanding across the supply chain, at all levels 
&lt;LI&gt;Utilize systems that deliver actionable information, integrated with your existing software 
&lt;LI&gt;Work until expected results are achieved &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
