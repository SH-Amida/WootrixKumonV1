			<description>Mental health conditions, such as depression and binge eating disorder, are common among patients seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery, according to a study. Bariatric surgery is an accepted method of promoting weight loss in severely obese individuals. Mental health conditions may be common among patients seeking bariatric surgery; however, the prevalence of these conditions and whether they are associated with postoperative outcomes has not been known.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/bvYNPg2k5tY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Dieters who eat 'on the go' may increase their food intake later in the day which could lead to weight gain and obesity, new research shows. The findings from the study also showed that eating while walking around triggered more overeating compared to eating during other forms of distraction such as watching TV or having a conversation with a friend.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/QD-Ct4Z8nPU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Picky eating among children is a common but burdensome problem that can result in poor nutrition for kids, family conflict, and frustrated parents. Although many families see picky eating as a phase, a new study finds moderate and severe picky eating often coincides with serious childhood issues such as depression and anxiety that may need intervention.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/ecNuZ4RsW9U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A complex relationship between genes, hormones and social factors can lead to eating disorders in women. An eating disorder expert has made monumental strides in deciphering how these factors interact. In her latest discovery, she has found that during the menstrual cycle, ovarian hormones act like a master conductor -- they turn genetic risk on and off in the body.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/i0KcRCZWuDc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are significantly more likely to have an eating disorder -- a loss of control eating syndrome (LOC-ES) -- akin to binge eating, a condition more generally diagnosed only in adults, according to results of a new study. The findings suggest a common biological mechanism linking the two disorders, and the potential for developing treatment that works for both.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/bcrXd7201Sw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Mechanisms that link compulsive binge eating with hypertension identified</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/bhMU3N67fa4/150330141356.htm</link>
			<description>An estimated eight million adults in the U.S. suffer from binge eating disorder. Now, researchers have shown that compulsive binging on foods that are high in fat and sugar can trigger specific molecular changes that can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension). While others have studied the effects of binge eating on the brain, this study is the first to look at its molecular effects on the expression of certain proteins in the body.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/bhMU3N67fa4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Hunger versus reward: How do anorexics control their appetite?</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/xqJENV7iSaQ/150323075749.htm</link>
			<description>Many adults, regardless of their weight, resolve to avoid fatty foods and unhealthy desserts. But despite one's best intentions, when the moment for decision comes, that chocolate lava cake is often too enticing and self-control vanishes. This behavior is normal because hunger increases the intensity of food rewards. Yet, individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), despite their state of starvation, are able to ignore such food-related rewards. A new study sheds new light on the brain mechanisms that may contribute to the disturbed eating patterns of anorexia.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/xqJENV7iSaQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>People with anorexia nervosa and with body dysmorphic disorder have similar abnormalities in their brains that affect their ability to process visual information, a new study reveals. People with anorexia have such an intense fear of gaining weight that they starve themselves even when they are dangerously thin. Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with a perceived flaw in physical appearance.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/JiPH9ujxjQI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Researchers have revealed how obesity is associated with altered opioid neurotransmission in the brain. New research reveals how obesity is associated with altered functioning of brain's opioid system, which is intimately involved in generating pleasurable sensations. The researchers found that obesity was associated with significantly lowered number of opioid receptors in the brain. However, no changes were observed in the dopamine neurotransmitter system, which regulates motivational aspects of eating.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/fDl9hq8fdQ4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Adolescent binge drinking has been linked to a host of problems, including worse school performance, risky sexual behaviors, illicit drugs, and a greater risk of suicide. Binge drinking may also be linked to problematic eating behavior, yet little research exists. A study of the relationship between binge drinking and eating problems among Russian adolescents has found that problematic eating behaviors and attitudes are commonplace, and that binge drinking is associated with more eating problems in girls than boys.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/P8-y9FK7Z9A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and binge eating disorder affect approximately 5-10 percent of the general population. Researchers have demonstrated the involvement of a protein produced by some intestinal bacteria that may be the source of these disorders. Antibodies produced by the body against this protein also react with the main satiety hormone, which is similar in structure. According to the researchers, it may ultimately be possible to correct this mechanism that causes variations in food intake.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/ZyNkiMItlqY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Self-compassion key to positive body image, coping</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/rhqm3eCCnW4/140929180413.htm</link>
			<description>Women who accept and tolerate their imperfections appear to have a more positive body image despite their body mass index and are better able to handle personal disappointments and setbacks in their daily lives. Research has found that this self-compassion might be an important means to increase positive body image and protect girls and young women against unhealthy weight-control practices and eating disorders.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/rhqm3eCCnW4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/J8M8mcgTBTs/140929105140.htm</link>
			<description>The current state of knowledge about anorexia in men and boys has been the focus of recent study. "Our results show that certain particularities can be identified in males, especially related to personality, gender identity, and sexual orientation", says an author of a new study on the topic.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/J8M8mcgTBTs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Two different family-based therapies are both effective at combating anorexia nervosa in teenagers, according to the largest study ever to compare two such treatments for the life-threatening eating disorder. The findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting the value of parents' involvement in anorexia treatment.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/Mr_5jG3p79U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>New estrogen-based compound suppresses binge-like eating behavior in female mice</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/2jhn5JNvUrE/140826205515.htm</link>
			<description>The hormone estrogen can specifically trigger brain serotonin neurons to inhibit binge eating in female mice, researchers report. They add that this result is consistent with data in humans. "We can speculate that in women who develop binge eating who also happen to have irregular menstrual cycles, it is probably because their estrogen function is somehow damaged, which is what leads to the development of binge eating," said the study's lead author.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/2jhn5JNvUrE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Those in a new study being treated for anorexia not only suffered with negative emotions but also felt emotionally positive, having a sense of pride over being able to maintain and exceed their weight-loss goals. âBeing in control is important for many of these women,â one author said. âWhat we need to do is find a way to reconnect the positive emotions they feel in losing weight to other aspects of their lives that will lead to a more balanced sense of happiness.â&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/vjT-TvKFnb0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Eating disorders and depression in athletes: Does one lead to the other?</title>

			<description>Sport is a proven contributor to high self-esteem, confidence, positive outlook and good health. It would be reasonable to assume then that athletes have higher than average protection from depression and dysfunctional eating? On the contrary, athletes are considered three times more likely to develop an eating disorder and there is strong empirical evidence linking eating disorders and depression. Previous research to determine causality between the two conditions has been conflicting.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/a7y5QBhYNOE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Does food addiction exist? Research finds food addicts lacking psychological inhibition</title>

			<description>Women with weight problems were more impulsive than average in a food-related psychology test, a new research paper has shown. This suggested that they are more instinctively stimulated by images of food as well as lacking contemplative will power. Further, some women reported food craving even if they had eaten recently, a symptom of possible food addiction.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/1fW9jYFQOW0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Creatures of habit: Disorders of compulsivity share common pattern, brain structure</title>

			<description>People affected by binge eating, substance abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder all share a common pattern of decision making and similarities in brain structure, according to new research. "Compulsive disorders can have a profoundly disabling effect of individuals. Now that we know what is going wrong with their decision making, we can look at developing treatments, for example using psychotherapy focused on forward planning or interventions such as medication which target the shift towards habitual choices," authors said.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/JI61JkmDl5s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Have you ever said to yourself that you would only have a handful of potato chips from the bag then, minutes later, realized you ate the whole thing? A recent study shows that this type of impulsive behavior might not be easily controlled -- and could be a risk factor in the development of food addiction and eating disorders as a result of cellular activities in the part of the brain involved with reward.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/Y-7Ua1Y1zI8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder May Reflect a Propensity for Bad Habits</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/jtQVT6FHXDM/140410083349.htm</link>
			<description>Two new studies shed light on the propensity for habit formation in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These studies suggest that a tendency to develop habits, i.e., the compulsive component of the disorder, may be a core feature of the disorder rather than a consequence of irrational beliefs. In other words, instead of washing one's hands because of the belief that they are contaminated, some people may develop concerns about hand contamination as a consequence of a recurring urge to wash their hands.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/jtQVT6FHXDM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Perception that eating disorders women's problem delays men getting help</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~3/FmJ3lslFSZ4/140408213541.htm</link>
			<description>The widespread perception that only women have eating disorders is preventing men with these problems from getting the help and support they need, indicates a small study. Estimates suggest that around 1 in 250 women and 1 in 2000 men in the UK have anorexia nervosa, one of the four recognized types of eating disorder -- the others being bulimia nervosa; binge eating disorder; and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/eating_disorders/~4/FmJ3lslFSZ4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
